Wells Assembly members concerned that they "seem like fools"
Among some members of the Assembly has spread a concern over the proposal to change their title to the MWP.
This has come as a result of plans to change the assembly's name to "Parliament of Wales".
Assembly members from all over the political spectrum are concerned this could spur ridicule.
A Labour Party assembly member said his group was concerned "that this rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Wells, the eup means "dulla" and pwp means "kaka".
An MP from the Wells Party said the whole group was "satisfied" and has proposed the options.
A Shelsian conservative said his group was "open minds" about changing the name, but said there was very little difference between the words "MWP" and "Budla".
In this context, the pronunciation of the "w" letter in Wells is similar to that of the "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation for the declaration of name change, said, "Of course the final decision for appointing members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The Wells Government law of 2017 gave the Tagrine Wellsian Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a consultations with the public, and its proposal for the assembly's appointment as the "Parliament of Wales" found broad support.
On the issue of the title of members of the Assembly, the Commission favoured the appointment of "members of the Wales Parliament" or "WMP", but the "MWP" option found more support in a consult with the public.
Apparently, members of the Assembly are suggesting alternative elections, but the fight for reaching consensus can turn into a headache for Chairman Elin Jones, of which legislation on changes is expected within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes regarding the way the assembly functions, including rules for the exclusion of members of the Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
During the discussion of the legislation, the final vote on the issue of their appointment will go to members of the Assembly.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name.
On Sunday, voters will vote for changing their country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The vote by the people was decided in an effort to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia itself.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name constitutes a claim on its territory and has consistently rejected its requirements for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on changing the name, has indicated he will not recognise the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's bells fall silent as churches in Harlem face hardships
"Historically, the elderly people I talked to say there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today both are missing."
He said that the removal of grass is understandable.
"Today, people socialise in other ways," he says.
"Barrets are no longer meeting points in the neighborhood, where people go regularly."
As far as churches are concerned, he says the money from the sale of property will not last as long as leaders claim "and sooner or later they will return to the starting point."
He added that the churches could be replaced by residential palaces full of people who would not support the remaining holy sites in the neighbourhood.
"Most of the people buying residential facilities in these palaces are white," he said, "so very soon the day will come when these churches will close forever, as it is inevitable that most people who settle in these dwellings will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a metropolis of the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original congregation of white Methodists was transferred in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was owned by a congregation of colored people who had their place of worship nearby.
St. Martini passed a congregation of colored people under the direction of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of minority traders on125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem who refused to hire or promote colored people.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged by a fire, but after Father Johnson's parish made plans for reconstruction, they ordered the Cretin.
Rev, David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called it "the burden of poor people."
The expert who played the Creo in July called it something quite different: "A cultural treasure" and a "unplaceable historical institution."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also said that this was the world’s first breeder to be played by a colored musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who was transferred to a larger cafe in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin hadn't replaced him.
The events of recent months in St. Martin have been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some sent by secular church leaders and others by episcopal diocese.
The Parish Council - the governing community body, composed of secular leaders - has written to the diocese in July, with concern that it "would try to transfer costs" to the parish council, despite the fact that it was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishes complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark wounds 13-year-old during a dive to catch crabs in California
A shark has attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy Saturday as he was diving to catch crabs in California on the day of the opening crab season, officials say.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m., near the Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with some friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then driving towards him along with a group to take him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought at first the boy was just thrilled by the grab of a crab, but then "I realized that he was yelling "He bit me!
It bit me!"
Hammel says that when he arrived at his son, he saw that his entire cell was torn.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: '"There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the "Redy's" Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was pronounced in critical condition.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Coast Guard captain Larry Giles said at a news conference for the media that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks ago, but was designated as a safe shark species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the body.
Officials banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ekinita for 48 hours, for investigative and security purposes.
Giles said that there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans entry into UK cosmetic market
Sainsbury's is competing Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with big store-style cosmetic wards, with a staff of specialised vendors.
Under a significant attempt to enter the UK's 2.8 billion-pound cosmetic market, which is continuing to increase as sales of fashion and household furniture decline, larger cosmetic wards will be tested in 11 stores around the country and spread to more stores next year if they result in success.
Investment in cosmetics comes at a time when supermarkets are searching for ways to fill shelf spaces once used for television, microwaves, and household furniture.
Sainsbury's said it would double its supply of cosmetics by 3,000 products, including for the first time such brands as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Paw Paw.
Even the existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be given more space, with areas dedicated to corresponding brands, similar to those located in stores like Boots.
The supermarket will also market its cosmetic line again, so that most of the products are fumes - which are increasingly required by buyers of younger ages.
In addition, the Greek perfumer "Fragreece Shop" will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south of London, while a second is expected to open later this year at Saly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and a tendency toward the daily purchase of small quantities of food in neighborhood stores mean that supermarkets now have to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, has indicated that the outlets will begin to look more and more like big stores, while the supermarket chain tries to fight the discounts of Aldi and Lidl's prices with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has put outlets "Argos" in hundreds of stores and introduced a set of "Habits" which, according to him, has promoted food sales and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to restructure its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments resulted in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a union of societies with Boots in the early 2000s, but the union broke down after a debate over how to divide the revenue from pharmacies into his supermarkets.
The new strategy comes three years after Sainsbury's sold his pharmaceutical business to 281 Celesio stores, owners of the pharmaceutical network "Loyds", for 125 million pounds.
He said "Loyds" would play a role in the plan, adding an extensive range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Possay and Vicky in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial leader of Sainsbury, said: "We have transformed the appearance of our cosmetic wards to improve the environment in favor of our clients.
We have also invested in specialised training staff, which will be willing to give advice.
The range of our brands is conceived in such a way as to suit any need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations show that we are now an attractive cosmetic destination, which makes a difference from the old way of making purchases."
Peter Jones "infuriated" as Holly Willoughby withdraws from the 11 million-pound deal
"Dragons Dan" star, Peter Jones, has left "crazy" after television host Holly Willoughby has been withdrawn from an 11 million-pound deal with his business dedicated to a certain lifestyle, to focus on her new contracts with "Marks and Spencer" and "ITV"
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home furniture brands and cool accessors.
The business of these two was compared to the "Goop" mark of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of "The Morning" turned to the Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has angered the star of "Dragons Dan", Peter Jones, after the last moment of their lucrative business costing a certain life-style - to focus on her promising new contracts with "Marks & Spencer" and "ITV".
Sources say Jones was "infuriated" when the gold girl of television admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements - worth up to 1.5 million pounds - meant that she no longer had enough time to devote their brand of household furniture and "Truly" access.
Business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's "Goop" brand and was projected to double its estimated assets at 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, turned to the Instagram to announce her departure from "Tourly", Jones has flown out of Britain to one of his vacation homes.
One source said, "Trouly was undoubtedly at the top of Holly's priorities.
That would be her long - term future for the coming decades.
Her decision to retreat left all the people involved absolutely stunned.
No one could believe what was happening Thursday, it was so close to the opening.
There is a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold at the offices in Marlow."
Experts think the departure of the Top Morning presentation, which is among the most successful British stars, can cost the firm millions, due to considerable investment in products from pillows and candles to household clothing and furniture, and cause further delays in its opening.
And that could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as its director in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones has a 40 per cent stake in the Baldwin television production firm.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of "I'm A Cerebrity" a TV.
Last evening, a source near Jones said "We do not want to comment on his business issues."
Harsh conversation "and then we fell in love"
He made a joke about the criticism he would receive from the news media because of a comment he made, which some would describe as "not worthy of a president", and because of the positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given in so much?
Trump said to mock the voice of news announcers.
"I didn't give up at all."
He said Kim is interested in a second meeting, after their first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step towards unleashing North Korea.
But negotiations on nonlethargy have been cut off.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Jong Ho, has addressed the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, saying the North sees no "reactive response" from the US to the first steps being taken by North Korea for nonletalization.
On the contrary, he says, the US is continuing sanctions aimed at under pressure.
Trump held a far more optimistic view of his rallying speech.
"Things are getting better with North Korea," he said.
"We were entering the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have an excellent relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results - disrupting missile testing, assisting in the release of hostages and returning home to the rest of the American military.
In his speech regarding Kim, he defended his unusual approach.
"It's very simple to behave as president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing towards the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and the Indonesia earthquake destroy an island, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, nonprofit foreign organisations were told that their presence was not necessary.
Despite the shift of more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population, no national catastrophe was declared, which constitutes a prerequisite for the Catalisation of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have in many cases made it clear that they do not seek international support, so the issue is a bit challenging," Mrs. Sumung said.
While Save the Children is setting up a team to travel towards Palu, it is still not known for sure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
In view of Indonesia’s frequent shakings, the country remains extremely unprepared in the face of the wrath of nature.
While shelters against the tsunami have been built in Aceh, they are hardly found in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning in Palu, despite a warning being issued, is likely to have contributed to the loss of lives.
Even under the best of circumstances, travel between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok for dealing with earthquake victims is traveling towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster zone.
President Joko Widmore has used the improvement of Indonesia's lame infrastructure as the focal point of his election campaign, and has invested generous amounts of money for roads and railways.
But lack of funding has upset Mr. Yoko's administration, while it is in the face of new elections to be held next year.
Mr. Yoko is also facing pressures from continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim community have embraced a more conservative form of trust.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and tens of thousands have moved from their homes after the clash of Christian and Muslim groups on the street, where choppers, bows and arrows were used, and other cold weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturgeridge scores an equal goal against Chelsea in the last few minutes
Daniel Strrridge has saved Liverpool from a defeat at Premier League v. Chelsea, with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Stryridge got a pass from Gerdan Shaqiri at about 30 yards from the Chelsea gate, while his team was losing 1-0.
He pushed the ball gently to his left before making a blow to the distant gate.
The ball flew over the area until it diverted to the top and right corner of the net.
The ball escaped the air dance of Cape Arrizabalaga and ended up in the net.
"The aim was to put myself in the right position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play ball ahead, so I tried to create myself as much time as possible," StoverpoolFC.com said.
"I saw Kante coming, I checked the ball with one touch, and I didn't think too long, but I just hit."
Chelsea led with a score of 1-0 in the first half, following a goal in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker made a rerun at Mateo Kovacevic during that game before turning near the field and heading toward the Liverpool midfield.
Kovacevic made a quick combination in the middle.
Then he gave a beautiful vertical passage that brought Hazard into the area.
Hazard passed the defence in the speed duel, and with a left-hand kick scored on the second pole, passing the ball behind Liverpool's goalie, Allison Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples at the Champions League phase on Wednesday, 3 pm, at São Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA European League on Thursday, 3 p.m. in London.
Tsunami death to Indonesia totals 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, the national disaster agency said in the early hours Sunday.
According to reports, many are trapped under the ruins of buildings collapsed from the 7.5-strong earthquake that hit Friday and caused waves of up to 20 feet high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo said at a news conference.
The town of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000 people, is buried under the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman finds her death by stab wound
A murder investigation was announced after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with injuries caused by a knife at Grayson Mews on John Street, while a 32-year-old man has been arrested as a suspect in the murder.
Police have called on local residents who have seen or heard anything report for evidence.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to call on any person in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead, who may have seen or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
Also, I want to call everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught film footage, to contact us because they can have essential information of importance for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the victim is a resident of Birkenhead and her body was found inside a residence.
This afternoon friends who thought they knew the woman came to the stage to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are continuing, while police have said they are notifying the victim's family.
A resident taxi driver in Grayson Mews has tried to break into his apartment, but has been informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was left speechless when he discovered the story.
Now, residents are being reported that they will be allowed to enter their homes in just a few hours.
A police officer has been heard telling a man that the whole area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman has reached the crime scene in tears.
She repeats over and over again the words "this is terrible."
At 2: 00 p.m., two police vans were inside the perimeter, and another van was outside.
A number of officers were positioned inside the perimeter, monitoring the residence block.
Every person with information is required to send a direct message to @MerpolCC, call 101 or contact "Crimestoppers" anonymously in number 0800 555 111 by selecting code 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue in Parliament, the most recent monument affected by the debate on "reography of history"
Its removal would be a deserved punishment for the Taliban destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artefacts on the part of his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "Magley" and "efforts to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "Between the current debate over the removal of statues, the aim of Oliver Cromwell's image outside Westminster Palace was inevitable.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither commanded nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe this would be a sacrifice of Cromwell wrong for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Thorneycroft's excellent portretisation of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many think is still worthy of praise.
Mr. Goldsmith said of The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, saw Cromwell as a protector of parliament from outside pressure, which, of course, in his case, was the monarchy.
The fact that this is a completely accurate portrayal is the subject of ongoing historical debates.
What is certain is that the mid-20th century conflict shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual figure known which represents one side of that medal.
His achievements as Lord Synchronisor also deserve to be celebrated and remembered."
Killer pig wounds Chinese farmer to death
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only with his last name, "Yuan", was found lifeless with a cracked artery and covered in blood near a pigsty in the Liupanshiu market in Guizhou province, reported "South China Morning Post" on Sunday.
A pigs farmer prepares to inject swine vaccines into a stable on May 30th 2005, in Xinging, Qinghai Province, China.
Reportedly, he had traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning his cousin found him lifeless and uncovered the door of a nearby pigsty.
He said there was a big male pig with his mouth blood in the stable.
A forensic examination has confirmed that the 550-pound pig injured the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's feet were bleeding and crippled," said his cousin, identified as "wu," as quoted in the evening news in Guyang.
At the footage shot by the security camera, Yuan was seen entering the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager has confessed to the evening news that the pig was held in solitary confinement to prevent another attack, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of swine - attack people have been marked even earlier.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, inflicting severe wounds on the husband.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig grabbed a Welsh farmer behind his tractor until his wife drove the animal out.
After an Oregon farmer was bitten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that usually pigs are not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as "inciting".
"They just want to play.
They're like curious little ones... their goal is not to hurt you.
You just have to show them the proper respect," he said.
The effects of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring large, wide rainfall to the US Southwest
As predicted, the power of Hurricane Rosa is cooling down as it moves toward the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
In the following days, however, Rosa will cause floods in northern Mexico and the United States.
On Sunday, 5 a.m. with the east o’clock, Rosa was escorted at air speeds of 85 miles per hour, classed as a Kraeque 1 hurricane, and was located 385 miles [385 km] southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific Ocean is beginning to form an area of low atmospheric pressure that is moving toward the East, towards the U.S. West Coast, as the Rosa is expected to approach the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will continue to push great tropical humidity north towards the southwestern U.S.A.
On Monday, Rosa will cause 10-inch precipitation in parts of Mexico.
Then, the interaction of tropical moisture with low atmospheric pressure will cause heavy rainfall in the southwest during the following days.
At the local level, rainfall at between 1 and 4 inches [1 and 4 inches] will cause immediate flooding, leaks of waste and possible landslides in the desert.
The high tropical dam will cause rainfall rates in certain areas to reach approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of Nevada and southern Arizona.
2 to 4 inches [2 to 4 cm] of rainfall is forecast in some areas of the Southwest, mainly over a large part of Arizona.
There is also the possibility of immediate floods with rapid deterioration of conditions because of the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
Because of the danger of tropical rainfall, it is not recommended that you walk through the wilderness.
The heavy rains can turn canyons into mighty rivers, and thunderstorms will bring strong winds and dust storms into the area.
The proximity of the low-pressure weather zone will result in heavy rainfall on parts of California's southern coast.
Total rainfall can reach over half an inch, which can cause small waste leaks and slippery roads.
For the region, these will be the first rainfall of the rainy season.
Several scattered rain showers will begin approaching Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning before rainfall extends wider Monday and Tuesday evening.
The heavy losses will disperse on four sides Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
October in the U.S. may be marked by high temperature swings, with temperatures dropping in the Arctic, while the tropics remain warm.
At times, this leads to drastic changes in temperatures over short distances.
A good example is the drastic temperature difference across the Central U.S. on Sunday.
Between Kansas City in Missouri and Omahas in Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, the temperature difference is about 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Much of the Central and East US is expected to start October with warm temperatures, with an average of 80, from the southern fields to certain parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which temperature would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows high prospects for temperatures above the average in the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have attended Brett Kavanaugh's court hearing
Over 20 million people have followed through six television networks the interesting testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political blockade continued, and broadcasters suspended regular programmes to broadcast the turnaround in the last minute of Friday's events: an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for conducting a week-long investigation by the FBI on the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that it is 100 per cent sure that Kavanaugh had touched him while he was drunk and had tried to strip him off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a fiery testimony, said it was 100 per cent sure that it hadn't happened.
Likely, the number of followers was higher than the 20.4 million reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company was measuring the average ratings in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News channel and MSNBC.
The figures for other transmission networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting viewers from offices.
To put this figure in perspective, the size of this audience is similar to that of a football preliminary or that of the Academy Awards.
The Fox News channel, whose opinionists strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led other networks with an average of 5,69 million viewers during the 24-hour session, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS had 3.1m, NBC 2.94m, MSNBC 2.89m and CNN 2.52m, Nielsen said.
Interest continued to rise even after the court session was completed.
The flame was the main character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in Kavanaugh's favour, it was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as he faced protesters' screams as he tried to climb to the elevator to attend the Judicial Committee's hearing.
In CNN's live transmission, he showed up with his eyes down for a few minutes while he was being rebuked.
"I'm standing here, right in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have the power, while there are so many weak women."
The flame said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he said there would be more to say during the committee hearing.
Several hours later, all cable and satellite networks were covering directly the moment when the Judicial Committee would vote for the passage of Kavanaugh's candidacy for voting before all members of the Senate.
But Flake said he would do so only in the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate over the next week, as the minority Democrats had requested.
The flame was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a few other senators after him, Flake made the decision.
The choice of Flame was clever, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without conducting the investigation.
President Trump has requested the opening of an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing political games" with Brex
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and compromising national interest in an interview for the newspaper "Sunday Times".
Britain's prime minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the paper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued the attack on her plan for Brex, the so-called "Cravers", indicating that the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect taxes on each other is "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims murder: Police arrest suspect Dutheon Simpson for the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the killing of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player of the LSU team.
20-year-old Dutheon Simpson has been arrested and questioned in prison facilities under charges of wanton murder, Baton Rouge Police Directorate said.
Official sources released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the clash.
Police have found glasses at the scene and say they found traces of Simpson's DNA on them, reports the WAFB CBS subsidiary.
After Simpson's interrogation, police said he has admitted to firing a gun on Wayde, causing his death.
The amount for his release was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The Office of the East Baton Rouge Legal Doctor issued a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound from head to neck.
The department thanks the tax force of the fugitives near Louisiana State Police, the state police criminal laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for helping with the investigations that led to the author's arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva has thanked the area's legal authorities for "their reading and bringing justice to the country."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-inch boy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, had played basketball for LSU.
In the last season, it averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 hits per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball team coach Will Wade said the team was "sorry" and "astounded" by Wayde's death.
"That's what we're worried about all the time," Wade said.
Volcano casts favor on Mexico City
Ash from the Popcatetepetl volcano has reached as far as the southern neighbourhoods of Mexico’s capital city.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater was reawakened and 183 drop-ins and ash within 24 hours.
The centre had monitored a number of thunders and shakes.
Social media images showed thin ash sheets covering car windows in some parts of Mexico City, such as Xochymilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in volcano activity 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since a 7.1 - magnitude earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of voting for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday following the clash of pro-independence protesters with peacekeeping police forces, while thousands of people have joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalana's polarisation vote for secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists, surrounded by peacekeeping police forces, struck with eggs and powder, creating dark clouds of dust on streets usually swarmed by tourists.
Later in the day there were fights, and the police had to use their rubber sticks to end the collisions.
For several hours in a row, repeating the slogan "We Do Not Forget, We Do Not Forgive", pro-independence groups faced unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen persons were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local press reports.
In the region where pro-independence feelings prevail, tensions continue to remain high even a year after the October 1st referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite the low turnout, since citizens against the secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region through violent clashes.
On Friday evening, pro-independence groups set up camps abroad to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but it was forced to take another stream.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest together with his wife, said there was no hope that Catalana would gain independence in the future.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry for joy that they would have the opportunity to vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Even though in last December's local elections achieved a vital victory -- even though with close results -- pro-independence Catalan parties have found it difficult to maintain the momentum this year, as many of their most recognised leaders have either voluntarily left the country or are in detention and awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest on his phone to help the police, said the conflict had been fuelled by politicians from both directions.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since the end of last year, said it would run in European Parliament elections next year.
"Raising candidacy for European elections is the best way to reject the regression of democratic values and the repression that has been done to us by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonerry: Some persons arrested after the car crashes into the house
Three men between 33 and 34 and 39 years of age have been arrested after a car has crashed several times with a house in London.
The incident took place in Ballynagarde Crescent on Thursday, at around 7:30 BST.
Detective Bob Blemmings said that injuries were caused at the front door and in the apartment itself.
It is thought that at some point an arrow had been thrown in the direction of the car.
Menga's strike gives Livingston a 1-0 victory over the Rangers.
The first goal of Dolly Mega for Livingston provided victory
The team coming from a category below, Livingston surprised Rangers, causing Steven Gerard's second defeat in 18 matches as team coach from Ibrox.
The Dolly Menga strike proved decisive as Gary Holt's team tied him to second-place Hibernian points.
Gerard's team has not yet won an off-field meeting in Premiership, this season and next Sunday, they will face Hearts, the difference with which is eight points.
But first, Rangers will be waiting at home for Rapid Vienna in the match for Europe League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended a series of successive victories at six meetings, and coach Holt has not yet experienced defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunities in the face of well - established opponents
Hol's team should have gone to an advantage many minutes before they scored, after their direct attacks caused the Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but hit poorly at the gate, while then Alan Lithgow hit off the slide after being head-to-headed after Craig Halkett.
The natives were willing to let the Rangers play in front of them, given that they could cause problems in standard shocks.
And that's how the goal was set up.
Rangers caused a penalty blow and Livingston created space.
By that time, the Rangers had dominated the ball, but the local defense had turned out to be impassable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had almost never been put to the test,
This kind of game went on in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a reception.
Scott Pittman's kick stopped at the goalie of Rangers Allan McGregor while Lithgow struck out another standard hit of Livingston.
The raids were constantly coming to the Livingston area and being continually cleared, while the two allegations of penalty - following the Halket intervention of the player came in as substitute Glen Middleton, and another for hand-handing - were not considered.
Livingstone's Fenomenal Game - Analysis
Alassair Lamont from BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and phenomenal result for Livingston.
For one man, they played beautifully and continued to exceed expectations in this growing trajectory.
The style of the game and their team haven't changed much since they returned to the top, but a huge credit goes to Holt for the way he electrified the team since he arrived.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halket was outstanding, leading a perfectly organized defence, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worall in trouble the entire match.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although on occasion they played very well under Gerard’s direction, they lacked quality.
The final pass was gone--only once they succeeded in passing the opposing defense--and that's something that should serve as an alarm for the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan expected with mixed feelings in Cologne
Saturday (29 September) was marked by blue skies' smile as leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at regulating relations between NATO allies.
They have declined over issues such as human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
Later, Erdogan headed for Kolonje to open a new giant mosque.
The city houses the largest number of Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, police stopped gathering a crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters nevertheless took to the surrounding streets to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom were Kurds - also raised their voices to condemn both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Opposing protests reflect the divisive ability of a visitor worshipped as a hero by some of Germany's Turks and despised as autocrats by some others.
Road accident at Deptford: Cyclest dies after car crash
A rider has found death after being hit by a car in London.
The accident occurred near the Bestgood Street intersection with Evelyn Street, a busy street at Deptford, southeast of town, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped, and the rescue workers arrived immediately, but the victim died at the scene.
The crash occurred several months after another racer lost his life in an accident where the author left the scene, which took place at Childers Street, about a mile from the site of Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan police said the officers were working to identify the person and alert his family.
Roads have been closed, and buses have been reported using other routes, while drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long High Prison — Six Officers Injured During a Rebellion
Six prison officers were left injured during a riot in a high male security prison, the Prison Office said.
Rebellion broke out at the HMP Long High in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday, and still continues.
The "Tornado" specialists officers have been called upon to keep the riots under control, including eight inmates who are confined within one wing of the prison.
Officers have received treatment on the scene for some minor facial wounds.
A Prison Service spokesman said, "The specialised training prison personnel have been mobilized to keep control of the incident currently taking place in HMP Long High.
Six staff members have received injuries treatment.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and have made it clear that the responsible persons will refer to the police and can receive extensions of the prison sentence".
The HMP Long Martin houses over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had undergone hospital treatment after an attack by one of the prisoners.
And in October of last year, officers of the peacekeeping police force were called to prison to keep a serious situation under control, where personnel were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with immediate flooding (which could be an advantage for the drought zones)
While a tropical depression rarely strikes Arizona, this is probably exactly what will happen the first few days of next week as the remaining power of Hurricane Rosa passes through the desert of southwest, spreading danger of immediate flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued warnings of immediate flooding on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the lead in Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday's rainy hour.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical Cyclones have received storm status or tropical depression in a 200-mile radius from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Uranza Centre predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with up to 6 inches in isolated quantities at the Arizona Mogolon border.
In other areas of the desert in the southwest, including central Rockies and Grand Basen, precipitation is expected to be at 1 to 2 inches, while in isolated areas their total can reach 4 inches.
For areas outside the risk of immediate flooding, Rosa's rainfall could be a blessing, as the region has been hit by drought.
Although floods are a serious concern, some of these rains may be beneficial, as southwest is currently facing drought conditions.
According to the American Center for the Monitoring of the Thanaira, a little over 40 per cent of Arizona is facing extreme droughts of the second category", Weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit Mexico’s Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, still in hurricane power on Sunday morning, with winds at maximum speeds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 12 miles an hour.
The storm is facing cold waters over the Pacific, resulting in loss of power.
Consequently, the hurricane is expected to hit Mexico with tropical storm power in the afternoon or Monday evening.
Rainfalls over some areas of Mexico can be severe, posing a considerable threat to flooding.
"Bloodfalls of an average level of 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, and can be up to 10 inches," Weather.com reported.
Then Rosa will move north through Mexico, in the form of a tropical storm, before reaching her border with Arizona in Tuesday's early morning hours as a tropical depression, which will then move through Arizona, reaching southern Utah on Tuesday evening.
"The main risk expected by Rosa or its consequences is heavy rainfall at Baia California, in northwestern Sonorare and in the southwestern US desert", the National Uranza Centre said.
These rains are expected to cause life-risk floods, desert waste leaks and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Persistent Murders · Global Voices
Three teenage and 20-year-old boys have been arrested for suspected of remaining murder in the attempt, following the injury of a 16-year-old stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, about 0400 BST on Saturday.
He was escorted to the hospital, where he is currently in a "stable" condition.
According to Avon police and Somerset, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officers have called for presentations to anyone who may have picked up a video footage of the event by cell phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has faced the humiliation and wrath" of the Democratic Party
"A vote in favour of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and cruel tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling in western Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "has faced the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party during the process of his appointment.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying with conviction and excitement the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he had assaulted him sexually decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford too gave a witness during the hearing regarding her case.
On Saturday, the president said that that day "American people witnessed Kavanaugh's greatness, qualities of character and courage".
"A vote in support of the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most clever lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a record pure public service," he said in front of the crowd of supporters in western Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's appointment during the speech on the importance of republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks separate us from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I will not run, but I am contributing," he said.
"That's why I'm making so much effort and fighting for excellent candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are missioning to make "resistance and blockade".
The first major procedural vote by the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, the deputy of a senior GOP leader has told CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, while figures are expected to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of them caught up in huge waves that crashed on beaches, when Indonesia's Sulwes Island was hit by an earthquake and tsunami, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when waves up to 20 feet [6 m]) crashed ashore in the twilight, swallowing and causing the death of many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 quake.
"The day yesterday, when the tsunami threat arose, people were still carrying out their usual activities on the beach, and therefore did not run immediately and fell victim to it," said the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the Indonesian disaster prevention agency.
"The tsunami did not come alone, he took along cars, logs, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800km/h (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed up the tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centres in Peru.
Air photos published by the disaster agency showed a series of destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a water - surrounded mosque.
The aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake line was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Rating and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy generated by Friday's massive earthquake was about triple the power of the atomic bomb dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geographic position, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have multiplied the power of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "great heat", and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
Several corpses were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were left injured and 29 had disappeared.
Nugroho said the number of victims and damage rates may be much larger along the 300km coastline (190 km) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
The communication networks "were completely cut off without any warning" by Donggala, Nugroho said.
That area has over 300,000 inhabitants", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were travelling towards the affected areas.
"This has already turned into a tragedy, but the situation could get worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was sharply criticised for failing to announce Palu's tsunami crackdown, despite officials saying the waves had come at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage spread over social media, a man on the top floor of a building may be heard warning passersby on the way down for the tsunami to come with furious shouting.
Within minutes, a wave hits the beach, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters failed to verify the veracity of the footage immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage which cut off communications across Palu, making it difficult to co-ordinate the authorities' rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Yakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated persons continue to have great needs for food and other basic needs.
The city's airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widmore was expected to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims from the tsunami in Indonesia totals over 800.
The situation is quite serious.
While World Vision staff from Donggala has arrived without any trouble in the town of Palu, where employees are being accommodated at Tarpuline shelters in their office courtyard, they witnessed scenes of destruction along the way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They have confessed to me that they had seen many houses destroyed," he said.
The situation is quite serious.
Even though relief groups began serious efforts to set in motion the humanitarian aid mechanisms, some complained that foreign relief workers with extensive expertise were being barred from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and foreign staff may begin to circulate only if the disaster zone is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the regional level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government says "O.K., this is a national catastrophe", we can ask for national aid, but this status has not yet been granted".
The second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and families of missing persons were still hopeful that the case of their loved ones would be one of the few miracles ever to occur in case of natural disasters.
On the Sabbath day, a little boy was taken out of a well.
On Saturday, rescue forces released a woman who had been left under the ruins for two days with her mother’s corpse beside her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national parachutism team, had trained two of the missing paratroopers for the Asian Games, which were closed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of the other people stranded at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As an old parachutic professional, I'm very emotionally charged," he said.
Mr. Ghandon recalls how in the hours following the circulation of news of the "Roa Roa" hotel of the parachutism community, he had tried desperately to write to the WhitesApp contestants from Palu who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, his messages ended with just one sign of gray scaling instead of two blue - colored signs.
"I think that means the messages were not sent," he said.
Thieves steal $26.75 during the completion of a Newport ATM in Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police Directorate on Friday morning, several thieves stole $26,75 from a Brink employee who was reloading an ATM in Levere Newport.
The driver of the vehicle had been emptying an ATM at a entertainment center and trying to distribute other money, Detective Dennis wrote in his statement.
While he was busy, someone "came running back to the Brink employees" and stole a bag of money destined for surrender.
According to the statement, witnesses had seen several suspects leave the scene, but police have not specified the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police in the number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes the name to Ye
The Kanye West rapper will change his name to Ye.
Proclaiming the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Accreditedly known as Kanye West".
The 41-year-old West has long been called Ye, and has used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released on the market in June.
The change came shortly before his release at Saturn Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, "Yandhi".
He will replace singer Ariana Grande in the show, which cannot come for "exhale reasons", said the show's creator.
In addition to being a shortening of his current art name, the West has expressed in the past that the word has a religious significance for it.
I think "ye" is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you'", said the West earlier this year, talking about the title of his album with the Big Boy radio presenter.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
I went from Kanye, which means "the only one," simply "Ye", which is the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of what we are".
He is one of many famous rapers who have changed their name.
Sean Comps is otherwise known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he claimed he preferred the name Love and Brother Love.
A former West associate, JAY-Z, has done as he did with or without a separation line and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO vows not to use the army against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez, has pledged that he will never use military force against civilians as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody presentation against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador vowed that "he will never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, army troops opened fire on peaceful demonstrators in the square, killing a total of 300 people at a time when the students ’ leftist movements were taking a stand throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youths by giving students monthly subsidies and by opening more public universities free of charge.
He has stated that unemployment and lack of education opportunities push young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US must double the amount spent on research in this area, says investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments have come as different parts of the US government have announced artificial intelligence findings, despite the lack of an overall official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China has announced its plan last year: within 2030, it aims to take the first place for innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.
"The doubling of the budget for research in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, since other countries are still far behind the US and we are looking for a great next discovery in this area," Lee said.
Double funding could double the chances that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will take place in the US, Lee said in an interview for CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book, entitled "Super Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", published this month by Hoghton Mifflin Harcourt, is executive director of Synovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the Charles Mellon University, he developed an artificial intelligence system that passed on to the leading American player in Othelo, and then he worked as executive director near Microsoft Research and as president of the Google branch in China.
Lee praised the American government's previous technology competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Agency for Advanced Projects in the Defense Field, and asked when the next contest would take place in order to help identify the new visionarys.
Lee said that often U.S. researchers have to work hard to get grant from the government.
"It's not China that is driving academic leaders away; it's corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed brilliant minds from universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the US boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think the green cards should automatically be given to people with the title doctor in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China launched the New Intelligence Development Plan.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China offers financing for persons in academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations provide money for American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence established a Joint Academic Intelligence Centre, which is expected to include partners from industry and academy, and the White House announced the establishment of the Selective Committee for Archaeological Intelligence.
Meanwhile, this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called "AI Next".
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100m annually in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, American legislation aimed at establishing a National Security Commission for Archaeological Intelligence has not found implementation for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to decide whether their name would be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a movement that could resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked its membership efforts in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, thinks its northern neighbour's name constitutes a claim on its territory, and has vetoed its NATO and EU membership.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change could compromise the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia's population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has indicated that he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has cast doubt that voter turnout will reach the 50 per cent needed for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum ballot paper reads, "Are you for NATO and EU membership through acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, as one of the countries created by the breakup of Yugoslavia, this is a price worth paying to achieve membership in structures like the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, as it means a safer life for all of us," 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska said in Skopje.
Even though the referendum has no binding powers, a sufficient number of MPs have indicated they will maintain the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities had been reported until 1pm.
However, voter turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 per cent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for the sake of my children, we have the country in Europe," said Jose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the Skopje capital.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko cast their vote in the referendum on changing the name of Macedonia, which would pave the way for the country's NATO and European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30th 2018.
Facing parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small scene and was placing chairs in front of umbrellas set up by referendum boycotters.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not by entering the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country is poor, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us by the name of Macedonia, we can address other states like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much needed investment for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens are pro-EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive result would "confirm our future".
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, about 30 per cent to 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum - a figure below the necessary level of turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian television Telma found that 57 per cent of participants planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent indicated they would vote in favour.
For a successful referendum, the turnout rate should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The referendum's failure would hit the pro-Western government's first strong policy since its rise to power in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes through all Brighton defenses to score
Sergio Aguero and Rabeem Sterling braved all Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday, at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his goal in the 65th minute look extremely light.
The Argentina shooter got a pass in the middle at the start of the action.
He ripped through the three Brighton defenders before going out onto the open field.
Aguero later found himself surrounded by four green T - shirts.
He crossed a guard and fought speeds at the entrance of the Brighton area.
Then he followed him to the left where Sterling was located.
The English striker used his exit into the area to track the ball to Agueros, who struck right and crossed goalkeeper Mathew Ryan by throwing the ball to the right corner of the net.
"Aguero is suffering from a foot problem," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We discussed that he would play about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at the moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the blues their initial advantage at the Premier League game.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute.
During that action, Aguero took the ball into Brighton's midfield.
He painted beautifully for Laroy Sane on the left flank.
Sane advanced a few steps before going to Sterling on the second pole.
The blue striker led the ball to the net and then slipped off the boundary lines.
City will face Hophenheim at the valid challenge for the team phase of the Champions League, at 12:55 p.m. Thursday at 12:55 p.m. in Rhein-Nackar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to preserve the role of "The Indubiter" against Rocky.
With the Nationals eliminated from the chance to achieve eliminations, there was no reason to impose another beginning.
But Scherzer, who is always competitive, hopes to be given the opportunity to score against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is a chance of playoff for Rockys, who have an advantage with a match for Los Angeles Dodgers at the National League of the West.
Rockys achieved at least one chance for playoff, thanks to victory of 5-2 over Nationals on Friday night, but are still trying to take over the division title.
"Even though we are playing without any motive, we can at least sign up with the fan atmosphere here in Denver, but the fact that the opposing team will play at the highest level against which I can face throughout the year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in such a challenge?"
Nationals have not yet announced who will be entitled on Sunday, but are reportedly keen to let Scherzer start the meeting in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be presenting 34 as titler, conducted a training session Thursday and could appear on the field on Sunday, which could be a normal day off day for him.
Player from Washington, who shoots the right, is 18-7 with an ERA 2,53 ERA and 300 "stricouts" in 220 2/3 of the shots this season.
Trump collects western Virginia at rallying
The president referred indirectly to the situation regarding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, before speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"The November is crucial for everything we have done so far.
Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the biggest elections -- I'm not running, but I'm contributing, and that's why I'm trying so hard to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on, "You see this terrible group of radical Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they've made up their minds to regain power in any way, you see their shame and filth.
They don't care who they hurt, who they press with their feet to take power and control. That's what they want, power and control, but we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to make "resistance and blockade".
"And you have seen this during the last days," he said, calling the Democrats "enraged, cruel, filthy and disloyal".
He referred by name to the Democratic Chiefsenator of the Senate Judicial Committee, Diane Feinstein, which sparked a shout of discontent from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you spread the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I... wait... her body language was pretty bad-- it was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer an "stop open".
She's untolerant to those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for a no-confidence motion against me, I was not so surprised.
After all, I'm not the first members of the Labour Party to be told they're not welcome -- all because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was similarly treated simply because he firmly opposed anti - Semitism.
In my case, the no-confidence motion was a criticism of my failure to agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of a responsible economic policy, concerning national security and Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy countered with former leaders.
The announcement of the Labour Party meeting at Nottingham East said "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight-year period as the local Labour Party MP, the GC meetings have been just like that.
Unfortunately, meetings no longer have their previous tone, and the promise of a "soft and gentler" policy has long been forgotten if it ever existed.
It has become increasingly evident that opposing views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptance by the party leadership.
It started a while after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues with whom I thought that I shared similar political views began pretending that I would take a 180 degree turn and maintain attitudes with which I would not have agreed - whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Every time I speak in public -- no matter what I say -- the criticisms erupt in social media, with people demanding my dismissal, denouncing the policies of the centre, they tell me I shouldn't be part of the Labour Party.
And that's not just me.
I am aware that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as comments about me tend to be of a political nature.
I am fascinated by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face gender and racial discrimination every day, but they are not.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalisation of levels of violence.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an "opener" and with every motion of confidence, and with every change of the rules of selection, the party becomes increasingly closed.
For the past two years, I've been advised to sit down, not to be so noisy, and that's how everything "will be okay".
But that's not why I'm in politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, driven by the disregard of the Thatcher government that led to my failure at a general school, I have tried to lobby for better public services for those most in need -- whether as a member of a local council or as a minister of government.
I've never hidden my policy, even in the last elections.
Everyone at Nottingham East had my political stances and points of controversy with the current leadership.
For all who voted for the motion on Friday, I just want to say that the country is moving towards a Brex that will affect our families, businesses and public services, and I cannot understand the desire to spend time and energy in my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But really, the only message I want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether or not of the Labour Party: I am proud to be in your service and promise that no threat of dismissal or political favour will prevent me from acting in your best interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr tops the lists
The two delayed attempts may have changed some of the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in the superfluous Tenent's Premiership match today.
Now they top the lists as the only invincible team among ten teams.
In the end, it was their miraculous defense and courage to take risks the one who assured the local team victory, and coach Peter Murchie was perfectly right to be satisfied.
"We've shown ourselves at every game, and we're still invincible, so I'm normally happy," he said.
Robbyn Christie of Melrose said, "We want to congratulate the Ayr team, who took greater risks than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, back to goal by Frazier Climo, passed Ayer to the advantage, but a yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes's player, coming for this challenge from Warriors, allowed Melrose to show numerical superiority, and Jason Baggott got an untapped ball.
Climo increased Ayr's advantage with a penalty while shortly before the end of the first half, he scored and scored a individual action, bringing the score to 17-5 for Ayr before the break.
But Melrose started the second and Patrick Anderson's attempt, turned into a goal by Baggot, reduced the difference to five points.
Then, there was a long break as a result of the severe injury of Ruardh Knott, who left with the stretcher, and after the game was resumed, Ayr increased the result through an attempt by the Staffford McDowall, marked by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair MacPherson, was then punished with yellow card, and Melrose again used the fact that they had one more player, with an unbroken goal attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the bottom of a tough-looking section.
However, the locals returned, and when Sturan Hutchinson was punished with yellow cards because it prevented Climo, without a ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson made "touch down" behind the Ayr's triple (moul) back that was advancing.
Climo scored and did the same almost after the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe picked up the ball hit by David Armstrong in the area and led forward the attack player (flanker) Gregor Henry, for the local team's fifth attempt.
Stil Game star seems committed to a new career in the restaurant industry
The star of "Styll Game" Ford Kieran seems determined to enter the hotel industry after it was found to have been appointed director of a licensed restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis's role in the BBC's famous performance, with co-sceptaris and co-protagonists in the world of comedy, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last for the show, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craigang.
According to official records data, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on history, even though a source for the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan was trying to enter Glasgow's "producing restaurant industry".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without going out into the sea hopes the court makes way for the Pacific
Sailors patrol a fleet headquarters improvisation in La Paz.
Public buildings have raised the blue ocean flag.
At sea bases from Titicaca Lake to Amazona has been marked by the motto: "The sea is our property.
Retaking him is a duty."
On landless Bolivia, the memory of catching a coast from Chile in a bloody resource conflict during the 19th century is still quite alive -- as is the desire to once again sail across the Pacific Ocean.
Now, these hopes are more likely than they have ever been for decades, while on October 1st, Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice ruling after a five-year review.
"Bolivia is characterized by momentum, spirit of unity and tranquillity, and, of course, is expecting positive results," Roberto Calzadella, a Bolivian diplomat, said.
Many Bolivians will attend the SND session on large screens across the country, in the hope that The Hague Tributal will decide in favour of Bolivia that - after decades of irregular discussions - Chile is forced to hold talks to give Bolivia a sovereign, water-bound territory.
To Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic president is in the face of a controversial battle for second term in next year’s elections - Monday’s decision is very important.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he pledged in late August.
But some analysts agree that it is highly unlikely that the court will rule in Bolivia’s favor and that even if, very little will change.
The UN's headquartered body in the Netherlands has no tax to give another state part of Chile's territory, and has indicated it will not decide the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the end is coming up with a decision just six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the issue "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of helping with Bolivia’s cause, events of the past four years may have penalized it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been compromised by the current Bolivian administration", Zárate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has eliminated any remnants of goodwill left in Chileans, she suggested.
At a certain point, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Weltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was surprisingly rapid.
Monday will offer Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance "to end the 139-year-old disputes with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - was using the maritime issue for political interests.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to understand that we have to leave the past behind."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place as long as it cannot trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong Ho says his nation will by no means carry out the first disarmament from nuclear weapons, as long as it cannot trust Washington.
Rie was giving a talk on Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during a summit in Singapore among leaders of rival states.
His comments come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of reviving nuclear diplomacy so far "sleepy", more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Jong Un.
According to Ri, hopes that continuing sanctions and US opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will make North Korea kneel are futile hopes.
As long as Pyongyang does not act first to make significant disarmament movements, Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang's intention to withdraw its arsenal, which the state probably sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of giant hats which will soon come to the streets of your city
If you want to enrich your collection of hats or provide complete protection against the sun’s rays, do not seek further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of giant strange hats for their SS19 collection in the pasarella, which left all designers openly at Fashion Week in Paris.
Excessive unpracticed hats have spread to the Instagram this summer, and these designers have adopted their surprising creations.
Valentino’s unique creation was an extremely extravagant beige hat, decorated with a wide shelter with featherlike details surrounding the model’s head.
Other major accessors included watermelons decorated with stones, a magician's hat and even a pineapple -- but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of strange masks -- just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips, and they looked more like Hannibal Lecter than they did like a couture Haute.
One creation resembled diving devices, complete with air hoses and water glasses, while another resembled a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you like to follow this bold fashion - you're lucky.
Fashion analysts predict that giant hats may soon come to the streets of your city.
The train of giant hats followed it to La Bombs, the straw hat with the two-foot-wide shelter, which we've all seen, from Rihanna's to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the extremely unpracticed hat given to social media produced another great creation in the pasarella - a straw beach bag, almost as big as the model of swimming clothing that was carrying it.
The bright - orange rose bag, decorated with rafia fringes and a handful of white skin on top, was the most special creation of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection in Paris ’ Moda Week.
The stylist of famous personalities Luke Armitage confessed to FemAIL: "The next summer I predict to see hats and giant beach bags on the streets of cities -- as the designer has left a impact so large that it would be hard to ignore the demand for large accessors."
John Edward: Basic Language Skills for Global Citizens · Global Voices
In Scotland, private schools hold the record for academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another fine array of tests, reinforced further by individual and collective success in sports, art, music, and other fields.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Private School Council (SCIS), try to provide the highest level of service for students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further education of higher levels, for their chosen career and their country as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can draft and implement a adapted educational curriculum, we are witnessing how the modern language branch continues to be a widespread and popular choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language that he understands, your words go into his ears.
If thou speakest unto him in his own tongue, it is in thine heart that thy words go out.
These words are a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone when we want to develop relationships with people from foreign lands.
From the results of this year’s final exams, we can find that languages are leading the list of results, with the highest degree of passing grades among private schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who have studied foreign languages have received a maximum A grade.
The data collected by 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of students received a maximum A grade in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying in German, 69 per cent of those studying French, and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish also received A note.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as one of the vital skills that will undoubtedly need children and young people in the future.
Currently, the foreign language branch is considered as important as the STEM branches (science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) in private schools and beyond.
A 2014 study by the United Kingdom Commission on Employment and Skills found that among the main difficulties faced by employers in fulfilling vacancies, 17 percent were related to the lack of linguistic skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary for young people to prepare for their future careers.
With more jobs requiring foreign language ownership, these abilities are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have real advantages in the future as master of such a long - term ability.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign people will automatically position a multilingual person over competitors.
According to a survey by YouGov, which included over 4,000 adults from the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to develop a conversation, and French was the only foreign language spoken by a percentage of 2 figures, namely 15 percent.
That is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
Possession of many languages, especially the possession of languages of developing countries, will give children a better chance of employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different in the languages taught in them.
Some schools will focus on modern, more classical languages, while others will offer languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom in the perspective of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages that you can choose in private schools, staffed by experts in the field.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing a school environment that will prepare the children and "armato" those with the skills needed to succeed, however, the future.
At these times it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to have a vital importance for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be regarded as "ability of international communication".
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and essence to the young people of Scotland.
Il faut falls face-to-face.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Private Schools Council
LeBron is expected to debut with Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the fans who were waiting to see LeBron James in his first play for the Log Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play at the pre-Seron's opening game Sunday day against Denver Nuggets, in San Diego.
However, it is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"There'll be more than 1 and less than 48", Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers correspondent wrote on Twitter that, most likely, James will play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game pre-seson Lakers program.
"I don't need the matches before the season in this phase of my career to prepare myself," he said.
Time for Trump gatherings in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump kicks off a series of election gatherings this evening in Wheeler, West Virginia.
This will be the first gathering of five scheduled to be held next week, including stops in friendly areas involving Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the approval vote put on hold for his selection to complete the blank spot at the Supreme Court, Trump aims to create support for the upcoming mid-term elections, since the republicans risk losing control in Congress when voting takes place in November.
What time is Trump gathering in West Virginia today, and how do we follow it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to be held at 7 p.m. this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can attend the Trump rally in West Virginia online below, via live YouTube transmission.
It is likely that Trump will address this week's hearings at the High Court of Candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense because of accusations of sexual misconduct, with the expected confirmation of the Senate pending for a week while the FBI was conducting investigations on the case.
But the primary goal of these numerous gatherings is to help the Republicans take a leap forward in facing the November elections.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign staff said these five gatherings next week aim "to energise volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Controll of Congress is so important for its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we turn to the busy campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to be identified told Reuters.
Planned to take place in Wesbanko Arena in Wheeling, tonight's evening gathering can bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia news agency Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Senate West Virginia Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a boost in polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Cup Ryder 2018: US team showed readiness to fight while keeping their hopes alive by heading for the singles contest Sunday
After three unilateral seasons, the remaining four for Sunday afternoon may be what the Ryder Cup needed.
This swaying momentum, it's a totally created sports concept, but a concept where players really believe and never more in competitions like that.
But where can it be said that the momentum is now felt?
"They had a six-point break that now has gone to four, so we can say that some kind of momentum has been created, I believe," Jordan Spiteth said as he closed the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of four points ahead when it stays in play and twelve points.
As Spieth declares, the Americans hope that the odds are in their favour and they have a lot of things to be encouraged, in particular by the form of Spyth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and where they got three of the four possible points.
Spiteth has been ruthless from shooting to the pit and is leading by setting an example.
The party cheers grew as the round followed, thrusting the golf ball with a slight kick to get the match to the draw, when he and Thomas were earlier two points down after two rounds.
His light shot that gave them the victory of the match in pit 15 was met with a similar cheer, indicating that he believes the American team is still not out of the race.
"You just have to work hard and worry about your game," Spieth said.
All the players left now.
18 holes to leave a trail.
The only players with scores more than Spiteth and Thomas in the past two days are Franesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup story.
The strange but adorable European couple have accomplished four out of four and can't be mistaken.
"Moliwood" was the only couple that didn't catch a hit on the minimum Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided shootings on the minimum on Sunday mornings, Friday evenings and on the other nine Fridays in the morning.
This result and the way their energy seems to flow towards the excited crowd and reverses the idea that they are the players to be defeated on Sunday and that there will be no other player more famous than Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory as the sun sets on the "Le Golf National".
Probably both at the same time in different potholes.
However, statements of a European triumph are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson managed very easily with Sergio Garcia, the four-hour play hero, when he paired Alex Noren.
A point above the minimum and doubles in the front nine put the Spaniard and Swedish in a hole from which they had no chance of getting out.
However, on Sunday nobody will be there to help you get out of your hole.
Four games and couples are so amazing to follow closely because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change there.
Europe has played best as a team so far and has taken a significant lead until the final, but these four-year sessions also showed that the US team will still face even though some people, especially Stateside, have questioned this.
Europe leads 10-6 as it heads for the Ryder Cup final day
Europe has an essential advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after emerging from the four-games and with couples with an advantage of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspiring duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the race with two victories against a Tiger Woods struggling to boost their advantage to four points at the ‘Le Golf National'.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, offered to take the trophy that was lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the helpless American team in the two o'clock in the morning matches, leading to 3-1 series of results.
The American team showed more resistance in the four-game, winning two matches, but they couldn't reduce the difference.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual matches to hold the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first original European player to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed 'Molliwood', after a sensational weekend, are the second couple in the history of the Ryder Cup, who win four points in their four opening matches.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-game game, they combined quite well together to defeat a helpless Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more dramatic score of 5&4.
Woods, who had difficulty holding two meetings on Saturday, displayed occasional explosions of greatness, but he has already lost 19 of his 29 matches in the four-game and with couples and 7 in a row.
Justin Rose, stopped for the morning's four-game match, went back to partner Henrik Stenson in the couples game and took a 2&1 loss from Dustin Justin and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third place in the world.
Europe did not have everything in favor on a very beautiful and refreshing day in southwest Paris.
Three-time pro winner Jordan Spitth and Justin Thomas decided the difference to be seized by Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won a bold 2&1 victory against the Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fours, and returned later to beat the Potter and Rory McIloray 4&3 in matchups after losing in the first two pits.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team has turned the score after a margin between four points in individual games, even though the Furyk task force only needs a draw to hold the trophy.
However, since he was the second best player in two days, a counterattack on Sunday appears to be going beyond their reach.
North Korea says it will not be ‘ unilaterally ’ disarmed without gaining confidence
The North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations that the sanctions continued on Saturday were deepening distrust over the United States, and the country would in no way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Rhyng Ho told the annual troupe from around the world of the General Assembly that North Korea took "significant measures that show goodwill" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear tests, and vowing it would not add to the arsenal of weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we are not seeing any answers from the US in this regard," he said.
"Without faith in the US, our national security will have no confidence, and in these circumstances there is no way that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri reiterated North Korea's common complaints about Washington's resistance to a separate approach "in phases" to the nuclear disarmament process where North Korea would be praised for the gradual steps it has taken, his statement seemed significant because it did not rule out the unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Penani has done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit held for the first time between a incumbent American president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, where Kim pledged to work towards "the Korean peninsula nuclear distribution", while Trump pledged guarantees regarding North Korea's safety.
North Korea has requested an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has indicated that Penani must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tight international sanctions on North Korea.
"The US insists on initially being carried out 'Nuclear Hormatos' and increasing the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a binding way, even by rejecting 'the declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The perception that the sanctions can bring us to our knees are dreams in the sun of people who are uninformed to us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions is deepening our distrust."
Rhea did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, a statement the US leader highlighted earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the minister underlined three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jay, in the last five months, and added: "If the pair in the nuclear disarming issue were South Korea, rather than the US, the process of nuclear disarming on the Korean peninsula would not have come into this situation without way out."
Even so, the tone used in the New Speech was deeply different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the deployment of US territory targeted by North Korean missiles was inevitable as "Mr. President Devil" Trump called Kim "the rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "destruct it completely" North Korea thanked Kim for the courage shown in taking the disarming steps, but said there is still much work to be done and that sanctions must continue to be active until North Korea performs nuclear disarming.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months -- that doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Penny for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at the UN Security Council on Thursday that "implementation of the Security Council sanctions should continue firmly and without stopping until we can complete and final verification of nuclear disarmment."
The Security Council has unanimously imposed an increase in sanctions for North Korea since 2006, in a bid to end the funding of Penani's nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met on the sidelines at the UN General Assembly and said later that he would visit Penonini again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last visit did not go very well.
He left Penny in July saying there has been progress, and only within a few hours did North Korea denounce him for carrying out "mafiic-style demands."
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to disarm a missile zone and also a nuclear complex if the United States is to take "due measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "constitutional measures" he sought were security guarantees for which Trump pledged in Singapore and the move towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students take lessons on how to get enough rest
A new Harvard University course this year has included all students to sleep more, in an effort to combat the growing culture of the study "machchos" through the use of caffeine from these sleepless ones.
One academic noted that the world’s number one university students are often unaware when it comes to the most basic things on how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women, prepared the course of lectures, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to take this course after giving a report on the impact that sleep deprivation has on learning.
'At the end of it, a girl came to me and she said, 'Why is this being said to me now, in my senior year?'
She said no one had told her before about the importance of sleep - which surprised me,'' he said of the Telegraph.
The course, included in the programme for the first time this year, explains to students the necessary elements on how habits of a good sleep help academic and athletic productivity, and also how it improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of the university medical services, said the university decided to present this course after finding that students were seriously deprived of sleep throughout the week.
The hour-long course involves a series of interactive tasks.
On one side is a view of a dormitory, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books so that they can explain to them the effects of caffeine and lighting, and how athletic productivity is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of the routine of hours to spend in bed.
In another part, participants are explained how long - term sleep deprivation increases the risks of heart attack, honesty, depression, and cancer.
A map of the camp, with interactive icons, further encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know -- as you also have the right to know, the health impact when you choose to smoke," Prof added. Czeisler.
The culture of pride that you spend ‘ a night of sleep' continues to exist, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was an ever - increasing problem.
Making sure that you have acquired sufficient sleep doses, a good quality, should be the students ’ ‘ secret weapon ’ to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation leads the brain to a hunger mode, making them feel constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old Californian who studies physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened its eyes and inspired him to turn it into a course for the entire camp.
He hopes the next step is to ask all students of postgraduate studies to complete a similar research programme before joining competitive institutions.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students place a alarm clock on when to go to bed, and also on when to wake up, and be aware of the damaging effects of the ‘ blue light ’ coming out of the electronic screens and LED lighting, which can take out the biological sleep rhythm out of work, which leads to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0angers: Menga scores against Gerard's boys
Rangers received another blow as visitors as the strike of Dolly Menga gave Steven Gerard's dissolved side a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was seeking to record his first victory since the February 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused the second to lose in 18 matches to Gerard as coach, leaving his team eight points behind fugitive leader Ladbrokes Premiership, the Hearts team.
Menga scored seven minutes before finishing the first part and with a deployment of the Rangers' team looking completely helpless to even.
As Rangers now falls to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is directly behind Hibernian for goal margins.
Rangers can expect to have more trouble as their Capum Spence wingman was treated for a blow to the head after he was hit by a likely object thrown by visitors.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, which passed Air to the Betfred Cup semifinals.
On the other hand, Holt placed the same 11th field which grabbed a Hearts dot last week and that he would feel satisfied with the way his well-organised team drowns opponents in each round.
Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingstone created more when he had it in his possession.
They should have marked just two minutes before the start of the meeting, when the first post that Menga gave Scott Pittman in the framework of the gate protected by Allan McGregor, it was not used correctly by him by throwing the ball out.
A long crores from the sentence kick by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, just shot him out on the back of the gate.
Rangers took control of the game but they seemed to be more hopeful than they actually believed in their game in the opposing area.
Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a penalty after a quarter-hour game as he and Steven Lawless crashed, but referee Steven Thompson did not hear the Colombian complaints.
Rangers managed two hits at the gate at the first half, but Ibrox's former reporter, Liam Kelly, was not disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly's head kick and the assault of Ovie Ejaria without force.
While Liv's first goal in the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was being seen in the field, no one can deny that they deserved only to argue.
Again Rangers failed to serve long passes for Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball towards Scott Robinson, who kept calm to cross the Menga and score in a simple way.
Gerard acted on the rest between the parts as he replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and this change nearly did not give an immediate effect as the side turned on Morelos, but impressive Kelly ran out of his position to block it.
But Livingston continued to make guests play the way they want to, where Lithgow and the Halket shared with each other long balls from time to time.
Hol's team could extend its lead to the final stage, but McGregor stood firm and denied Jacobs before Lithgow fired off a ball seized from the corner kick.
Rangers' replacement Glen Middleton claimed later in the game for another penalty, while he was involved with Jacobs, but Thomson allowed advantage again.
Almanac: Geiger meter Inventor
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30th 1882, like today 136 years ago and VAZDIM... the day future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the production of what is known as the Geiger meter.
A key pillar of science since that time, the Geiger meter also became a main pillar of popular culture, as in the 1950 film "Zile of Coronado," with an actor tape of seemingly non-professional scientists such as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter used to track radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones in, you can actually hear the effects of atoms that are released from radioactivity to minerals."
Evans: "Don't tell me, I really am listening now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name goes on living.

One woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to know bad cells noticed that ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory so that they can ‘ alter ’ a protein that is common in certain types of cancer called HER2, and then reinventing these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the American National Institute for Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results show us that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "grows the growth of several kinds of cancer," including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colons, explained Professor Bercofsky.
A similar approach to extract immune cells from patients "to teach" them how to discover cancer cells has worked in the treatment of some type of leukemia.
Kanye West appeared at a pro-Trump rally, wearing a hat with the MAGA inscription, following his SNL show.
It didn't go right.
Kanye West whistled at protests in the studio during a broadcast on the Saturday Night Live show, following a disappointing performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for the post in 2020.
After performing his third song for that night called "Gost Town", where he was wearing a hat on his head that wrote "Make America Great", he continued to speak with our strong anti-democrat and rehesed his support for Trump.
"Every time I talk to a white person, they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a performance by Matt Damon, where Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Commission on charges of sexual harassment filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the West's hard speech records were uploaded to social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear whether Rock was trying to mock the West with that post or not.
Also, the West complained to spectators that he had spent a difficult time in the background because of what he had put on his head.
"They mistreated me in the background.
They said, ‘ Don’t go on stage with that hat on your head.’
They mistreated me!
And then they tell me I'm sunk," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West goes, "Would you like to see the sink?" saying, "Put my super-man hat on, because it shows that no one can tell me what to do.
Prove love."
His comments received whistles at least twice from spectators, and SNL cast members appeared ashamed, reports Variety, where one person told the newspaper "The whole studio fell quietly."
West was called a late vice-placer instead of Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had passed away a few days ago.
West surprised many with the interpretation of Love it, dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West was backed by the chairman of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted on Twitter: "For one of the most courageous spirits: FALEMANDS THAT SHORT IN THE TURMNY."
But broadcast designer Karen Hunter posted on Twitter that the West simply "was itself and this is extraordinary."
"But I choose to reward someone (buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art", whom I believe to shame and spreading ideology that is harmful to my community.
And he's free.
So are we," she added.
Before the show, the singer said on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was already "the dog formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper friend, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Leon, and also late Prince music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist who was known as Prince.

The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast First Stair Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Service.
The 'Game of Thrones' star, Kitt Harington, hits toxic masculinity
Kitt Harington is known for his swordsman role in the character Jon Snow, the violent series of medieval fantasy "Game of Thrones".
But the 31-year-old actor has hit the stereotype of the male hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen makes young men perceive that they have to act as though they're strong enough to be respected.
Speaking of ‘The Sunday Times Culture', Kitt said he believes ‘something has gone wrong' and was asked how to solve the toxic masculinity problem in the #MeToo era movement.
Kitt, who recently married his actress colleague in the "Game of Thrones", Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels 'very important' in solving this issue.
'Personally I feel very important about this matter at the moment -- where have we erred with the appearance of masculinity?' he said.
'What did we teach men as they grow up, about the problems we're facing now?'
Kitt believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity because of the highly male characters that appear there.
He continued: 'What is born and what is learned?
What does it teach on TV, and what does it teach on the street, that makes young men believe that they have to behave in a certain way to feel men?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change this thing?
'Cause obviously something went wrong with the new guys.'
During the interview, he also admitted that he would no longer shoot for "Games of Thrones" after the series ended at the end of next summer, saying that ‘warms and horses are at the edge of his nose'.
From November, Kitt will take part in a relocation of the 'True West' by Sam Shepard, which is the story of a filmmaker and his thieving brother.
The actor recently indicated that meeting his wife, Rose, is the best thing she got from the Game of Thrones.
'In this product I found the woman, so we can say that this show gave me the next family and determined my life from now on,'' he said.
Rose played Ygrite's role, the sentimental interest of Kitt's character Jon Snow, in the science-fiction series winning 'Emmy' awards.
The couple were married in June 2018 on the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/Sida: China reports increase of 14% of new cases
China has announced there is a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and Sida.
There are more than 880,000 people affected throughout the country, health authorities say.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Much of the new cases have been broadcast through sex, demonstrating a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV quickly spread to parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people receiving HIV through this way had almost gone to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and Sida in China has increased by 100,000.
Transmission of HIV through sex is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexualism was de-crimed in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT is said to still prevail.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have measured that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry women.
Most of the transmission of the disease is due to improper protective measures during sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment drugs as part of the effort to hit this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the data of the GOP senators has been spread by staff members, saying these are 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiratory intelligence'.
US representative Maxine Waters denounced on Saturday claims that a member of its staff had posted personal information of three US senators republic on the pages of lawmakers in Wikipedia.
The Democrat from Los Angeles confirmed that these claims were being prompted by experts and "absolute right-right" websites.
"Slanders, lies and only disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released is reported to include the home addresses and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hutch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing of sexually explicit misbehavior against High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The flow of information came shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Some of the conservative pages such as ‘Gateway Punch’ and ‘RedState' reported that IP addresses identifying the sources of publications were connected to the Waters office and released the data of a Waters staff member, reports Hill.
"This groundless claim is totally untrue and a great lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff--identity, personal information and the security of which has been compromised as a result of these false and fabricated claims--has in no way been responsible for the flow of this information.
This groundless claim is totally false and a great lie."
Waters's statement quickly faced online criticism, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial becomes so frustrating," Fleischer wrote.
"This means that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, he should not be angry.
It shouldn't be provocative.
He should not question the prosecution's motives.
He must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing extremely nervous during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is racing to take over Waters in mid-term elections, also posted his statements on Twitter.
"Great case, if it will be true," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement Waters said her office had signalled "constitution authorities and law-substantiate institutions on these false charges.
"We will make sure that the authors are discovered," she continued, "and that they take legal responsibility for all their actions, which have a devastating and dangerous effect for any of my staff."
Examining "Johnny English Strikes Again" -- comedy with the unequipped spy Rowan Atkinson.
It has become a coincidence for every new British-influenced film to be seen for hidden messages concerning the Brex theme, and this finds application and re-emerges on the stage of the "Johnny English" comeback in 2003 with "Johnny English."
Will this satirical comedy reveal how clearly ineligible we are with regard to new national opportunities in the field of exports?
In each case, the promissory eye-eyed person with a face like a rubber and seemingly helpless Johnny English, has received permission to confuse things for the second time -- his name, which shows more than anything else that he is a wide comical creature made up for non-language territories but frequents the cinema.
Of course, he is a missing secret agent who, in spite of surprisingly pretending to appear fascinating, has little of the inspector Cousseau, a few of Mr. Bean's character and a port of the type that only contributed to the release of a sound in the song ‘Chariots of Fire’, at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It is also based on the mystery man, traveler, and Atkinson international, who once played TV commercials that are now forgotten by ‘Barclaycard', leaving the country in chaos wherever he stepped.
There's a moment or two at the premiere of this movie.
I loved it when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in a medieval breastplate and the propeller’s sheet crashed a little into his helmet.
Here comes the gift of physical comedy performed by Atkinson, but humor seems like a feisty and sometimes too much, especially when ‘ serious' movies like 007 and Impossible Mission added a little bit of comedy as an ingredient in their movies.
Humor seems to address children more than adults and Johnny English's crazy events are not so creative, and they're focused on silent movements, the same as what Atkinson is doing in Bean's character.
The permanent theme, as well as this film, is the fact that Great Britain is in serious danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret network of British agents, revealing the identity of British field agents and lebetting the agent on duty - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last chance for a prime minister to appear as a pompous and combatist figure, who is already suffering an extraordinary political unpopular: Emma Thompson does his best to realize the character who looks like Teresa May, but there's not much text in the script he can play.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy has been compromised, so she's going to have to rely on someone who's retired.
And that means choosing Johnny English, who was now employed as a school principal in a high-class neighborhood, but that unofficially taught how to be a secret agent: there are great scenes here, because English is offering a spy academy in the form of rock school.
English is calling again to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and is reunited with his ex-assist, multi-wente Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to a submarine captain, in the role of a high-class girl, where Vicky Pepperdine was used a little bit wrong for that role.
So Batman and Robin did things totally backwards at Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action, fighting back with the beautiful fatal Ophelia Bulletova girl played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being fascinated by attractive technology billionaire, who claims he can solve the difficulties of British computers: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their ridiculous and entertaining orchids: masquerade, set fire to a beautiful French restaurant; cause chaos as they break into the luxury yacht of the Volta; and English is completely confused as trying to use Virtual Realism equipment to get acquainted with the insides of the Volta house.
All the sequences are normally about the final scene, but whatever it's fun and loud, the whole thing looks a little bit like a children's movie.
Very moderate stuff.
As in other movies, Johnny English, I couldn't help but wonder: doesn't the British film industry have a role for Rowan Atkinson to fit his talent?
The Labourist Party denies there is a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid in five days.
The Lamburist party led by Jeremy Corby is considering a radical plan that would make British people work four days a week - but get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company chiefs to save by using the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) for employees, giving them an extra day off.
We would see the workers enjoying a three - day weekend but continuing to take home the same salary.
Sources said the idea would be "comployed" with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country into a favour to employees.
Spending a week for four working days is an idea that has been embraced by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A high-level source of the Labour Party told the 'The Sunday Times' 'Before the end of the year a policy review is expected to be announced.
'It's not going to happen immediately, but a week with four working days is an aspiration that coincides with the party's approach to balancing the economy in favour of employees and also with the party's overall industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to embrace this idea, where and the Green Party had pledged earlier for a week with four working days during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is currently not being supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said, 'A week with four working days is not party politics and is not being taken into account by the party.'
Chancellor in The Shadow John McDonell used last week's Labour party conference to convey his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to transfer power from ‘unantic’ directors and ‘profiters’ to public service firms.
The Chancellor's shadowy plans also mean that current shareholders in the water companies may not take back all of their shares, because the labour government can commit ‘insistance' with the rationale of actions considered a violation.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on company boards and to create All-inclusive Property Funds to pass 10 per cent of private sector capital to employees, which means a dividend paid annually in value by 5500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy show up at 60 Minutes, if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh can change their minds
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises questions about whether the findings of the investigation bureau could influence any republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be aired on Sunday, the talk show's 60 Minutes correspondent, Scott Pelley, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy showed up more openly than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said that when I was in the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, so after the claims came up and I said, "Did you do this?
He was firm and clear."
Graham's vote, however, looks like it's carved on stone.
"I've made up my mind for Brett Kavanaugh and the change would only make a bomb charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned couldn't verify.
He's 36.
I don't see it will change anything."
What's the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the "Global Citizen", an annual music show that contains a large and impressive list of stars performing and also has a equally impressive mission; end poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will host crowds of thousands of people in the 'Great Lawn' in Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardy B and Shawn Mendez, but also to be aware of the real purpose of the show, to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen, which began in 2012, is an extension of "Global Power Project", an international group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively struggling against it.
In order to benefit a free ticket for the show (unless you want to pay a VIP ticket), participants must fulfill a series of tasks, or "actions" as voluntary, send an email to a world leader, conduct a telephone or any other meaningful way that would help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been when there are 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to convince them to ask for these interventions, or is it just another case of what is known as "click-activism" -- people who feel they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a message to Twitter?
Since 2011, "Global Citizen" is said to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, giving a boost to various goals.
These actions are said to have helped spur world leaders to declare commitment and policy worth $37 billion, said to affect the lives of more than 2,25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 pledges and statements as a result of the group's actions, with at least $10 billion already being distributed or provided as funds.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have had a direct impact on some 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main pledges include "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of investors and implementing agencies based in the United Kingdom committed to "helping children grow up with their full potential," promising them to give Rwanda $35m to help end malnutrition in this country, after receiving more than 4700 "circumulation" by the "Global Citizen" activists.
"With support from the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a memory of the past," the ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition" told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking 5,000 actions to call on the United Kingdom to improve feeding for mothers and children, the government declared funding a project, "The Power of Nutrition", which will affect the 5 million women and children who need food intervention.
In an answer to the most frequent questions on their website where it was asked, "What makes you believe that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as every civil right and as the anti-party movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Week, Shawn Mendez, Cardie B, Janelle Monae are some of the actors who will perform at this year's show in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hughes Jackman.
The US may use the navy for "blocks" to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
"If necessary" Washington can rely on its Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets including the Middle East, US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has discovered, according to Washington Examiner's quote.
Zinke claims that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate Syrian government - is a pretext to explore for new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to supply it with energy as they do with Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he reported.
And according to this official, there are ways to deal with this problem.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to make sure sea routes are open and, if necessary, to block them, in order to ensure energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing participants in an event conducted by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a non-profit organisation that has personified itself as the "heavy of energy consumers" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that these approaches are virtually the same.
"The economic outlook on Iran and Russia is more or less the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, as he referred to Russia as "a deceptive mask" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come after the Trump administration has undertaken a mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia -- a far cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "incompatible" gas pipeline project 'Nord Stream 2', which, according to Trump, has turned Berlin into a Moscow "robb".
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the $11 billion project of the ‘Nord Stream 2' pipeline, which is claimed to double the existing gas capacity to bring it to 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the heated controversy of the project by Washington is done simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the same opinion that energy cannot be a tool used for pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose the supplier," Russian Energy Minister Alexandr Novak said after a meeting with American Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American stance has met with opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organisation for industry in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (DUI), has urged the US to stay away from energy policies in the EU and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (DUI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "think seriously" if she wants to run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "think seriously" to participate in the race for president after elections in the middle term.
During a city rally in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and fix our destroyed government, and this includes putting a woman at the top," she said, according to the 'The Hill'.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren hit President Donald Trump during the rally in the city, saying he "is leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is known for her criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said "we certainly need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey released Thursday showed that a large part of Warren's own voters do not think it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of Massachusetts' "potential" voters said the senator should not run, according to the survey conducted by the Suffoldon Globe University Political Research Centre.
Thirty - two percent supported this candidacy.
The survey found that former Governor Deval Patrick enjoyed the greatest support for running, with 38 per cent supporting a possible run, and 48 per cent opposed his candidacy.
Other high-profile democratic names that have been discussed to compete in 2020 include former Szv, Joe Biden, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Beden said he would officially decide in January, the ‘Associated Press' reported.
Sarah Paulin cites Trac Pauli post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump's rally
Track Paulin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence
"What my son is going through, what he is experiencing after he has returned, I can connect him with other families, who feel the spread of PTK and some of the wounds our soldiers are returning to," she told participants at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paul called his arrest "the angel in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "come a little changed, hardened, come wondering if they get proper respect to soldiers and airmen and other members of the military, for what they have given the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence after an attack on a woman following a report of domestic violence and arms while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Washington Police Department.
18 states, D.C., support opposition to a new policy of asylum
Eighteen states and Colombia County are supporting a legal objection to a new American policy that denies asylum to victims who escaped criminal groups or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district deposited a commentary document as friends-of-the-judge in Washington on Friday, in support of changing asylum-seek policy, reports NBC News.
The plain name of the plaintiff in the Grace case against Séssion that the American Union of Civil Freedoms deposited in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang members" abused her, but American officials denied her asylum request on July 20th.
She was stopped in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries that produce a high number of U.S. asylum applicants because they are countries with widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum-search policy resumed a decision, in 2014, by the Immigrant Appeals Board allowing immigrants without documents to escape domestic violence and apply for asylum.
The General Prosecutor of the Columbia District, General Carl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "inignes decades of state, federal and international laws."
"The federal laws require that all asylum applications should be judged according to the facts and specific circumstances of the case, and such a measure conflicts with this principle," a guest-judge report stated.
Lawyers further argued in the report that the ban police imposed on immigrants' entry damaged the American economy, indicating their chances are to become entrepreneurs and to "offer the necessary labour force".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop giving asylum to victims who escape domestic violence and gang violence.
"Azili is available to those who leave their country because of fear or persecution based on race, religious belief, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political persuasion," Session said on June 11th, the day of policy declaration.
Asylum is never meant to alleviate all problems -- even serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu, while the death balance doubles in a race to find survivors
In survivors, the situation was extremely tense.
"The situation feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while carrying her sick little boy to an evacuation centre in the devastated town of Palu.
"The ambulance brings troops every minute.
There's no more clean water."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes, extracting their water - drenched belongings in an effort to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people have been hurt, and hospitals damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harris, who has broken his back and shoulder, were deployed at the Military Hospital outside of Palu, where patients are being treated in the outside environments because earth shocks are still continuing.
Tears welled up in her eyes as she recalled the violent shock of the earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor, which shared her with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was crushed under the ruins of the wall," Haris told the ‘Associated Press', adding that his family had come to town for a wedding.
"I heard the woman weeping and asking for help, but then silent.
I don't know what happened to him and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The American ambassador accuses China of ‘insulting' with ‘propaganda propagandistics'
A week after an official China newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American daily promoting the joint benefits of US-China trade, the American ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to distribute its propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the payment supplement of ‘China Daily’ in ‘Des Moines Registr’ - the most sold newspaper in Ioua State - after accusing China of attempted intervention in the U.S. congress elections held on November 6th, an accusation denied by China.
Trump's allegations that Beijing was trying to intervene in the US elections marked what American officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to add pressure to China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently mired in a growing trade war, which has seen drawing tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and American experts have said that China's repayment fees in this trade war were designed to hit exporters in countries such as Iowa, which has supported the republican Trump party.
Terry Branstadt, the American ambassador to China and the former governor in Ioana, a major exporter of agricultural products towards China, said Beijing has hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion published in ‘Des Moines Register' on Sunday Branstad wrote, "China is already doubling this harassment by placing propaganda ads in our free press."
"By distributing its propaganda, the government of China is being assisted by the jubilant American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid ad on Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the newsstands on the streets here in Beijing, you will find very few voices against and you will not see any real reflections of the different opinions that the Chinese might have of China's disturbing economic trajectory, since the media is under strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added, "one of the most prominent newspapers in China, avoided offering to publish his article," despite not saying what paper this is.
Analysts warn that republicans are alienating women voters ahead of elections in the middle of the mandate following Kavanaugh scandal
As many of the main characters of the republicans are to be solidified and to protect the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, prior to some sexual assault claims, analysts have warned that they will face a severe reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming mid-term election.
The excitement on this subject has been extremely high, and many Republicans have publicly declared that they want to continue by voting the candidate.
These things can't be undone," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Sirakuza University 'School Maxwell' told 'The Hill' for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts a last-minute attempt by Senator Jeff Flare (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation and that it will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or November," Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior national adviser and spokeswoman for the progressive ‘Moveon' group, said the Washington D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protesters sang 'The November Is Coming!' as they were demonstrating in the Senate corridors as Republicans, who have the Judicial Committee in control, decided to move forward with Kavanaugh running despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, ‘Mic' reported.
"Enthusiasm and democratic motivation will reach the top," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news page.
"People are saying that it has already been at high levels; that's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs and among young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, even though they don't like the president, usually don't vote at all."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her sexual assault charges against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested there would be a sharp reaction if the Republicans continued to support this nomination.
"This has turned into a complicated mix for GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Committee of Republicans, early last week, according to the 'NBC News'.
"It's not only about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed in the accused bank or not, it is also about the way the Republicans have handled this issue and the way they have treated the female," Guy Cecil, director of the Priories USA, told NBC News, a group which helps select the Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided over who to believe in watching the evidence of Ford and Kavanaugh, with the latter having slightly higher support.
A recent survey by ‘YouGov' shows that 41 per cent of respondents certainly or most likely trust Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent say they certainly or most likely believe Kavanaugh.
Also, 38 per cent think Kavanaugh, probably or undoubtedly lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent say the same about Ford.
After the Flame was insisted, the FBI is currently investigating the claims submitted by Ford, as well as by the other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reports the ‘ Guardian'.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee, under oath, that Kavanaugh attacked him at the age of 17 while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court, displayed his genital organs before her while at a party while they were studying in Yale, the 1980s'.
World Wide Web Creator plans to launch a new Internet to compete Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, World Wide Network creator, is creating a company that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology legend, ‘Inrupt,' is a company built from the Berners-Lee open-source platform called 'Solid'.
‘Solid' allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons are allowed to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview for ‘Fast Company,' Berners-Lee joked that the goal behind ‘Inrupt' is "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of this innovative company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create "store up their personal data on the grid" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, lists of things to do, musical lists and other personal and professional tools.
It's like having Google Drive available in a browser at the same time, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spiffy.
What is unique to the storage of personal data on the network is the fact that it remains completely in the hands of users what kind of information will access.
The company calls this "personal power through data."
The idea for Inrup, according to the company's executive director, John Bruce, is to bring together the resources, processes and skills needed to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, several developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of voluntary coders.
Starting this week, technology developers worldwide can create their decentralised applications using available tools on the Inrup website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking with "Facebook and Google whether to present or not a total change in which all their business models completely collapse at night.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post in the 'Medium' published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt mission "is to provide trade energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he founded the World Wide Network Conservation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the network's impartiality debate.
Even while founding Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Network consortium, the Network Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic of this new era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Giving the Victoria Cross during World War I is celebrated for the clergyman
The only clergyman to have won a World War I Victoria during the quality of the warrior has been commemorated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Belenglise and Lehaucurt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never realized that he had won the highest British military title.
A memorial stone was presented by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "extensively symbolic" for the memorial to appear exactly 100 years from the heroic act that awarded the medal to his grandfather.
According to the 'London Gazette', on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the channel of Saint-Quentin "through a thick fog and under the hail of bullets from fields and machine guns."
He then rushed to the line of fire and with a "great honour" led the battalion forward and seized one of the weapons on the battlefield and the only one killed three persons from opposing troops.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions "are something he could never achieve but something that really shows modesty."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, decided from a wreath after the parade, which was led by the band "Brentwood Imperial Youth".
Michael Vann said "he felt highly honored that he was part of this parade" and added that "the value of a real hero is emerging from the support being given to him by many."
MMA fans stayed up all night chasing Bellador 206, but instead they saw "Derrkuce Pepa."
Imagine, you've been up all night to see Bellador 206, and then you've had your chance of seeing this major event.
The show by San Jose contained 13 matches, including six fights in the basic package, and would be shown in real time at night on channel 5, in the UK.
At 6: 00 a.m., while Gegarde Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in Britain were surprised when the broadcast changed to show the Pepa Pig.
Some were disappointed after staying awake all night until the first few hours, especially for the match.
A fan on Twitter described this passage from the game to a children's cartoon as "a ugly joke."
"It is the government's rules which define that at 6am that content was not appropriate therefore and we should switch to a children's programme," said Dave Schwarz, vice president of the Bellator marketing and communications, when asked about broadcasting.
"Durkucia Pepa," yes.
The president of the Bellator company, Scott Coker, said they would work on the programming to include viewers from Britain in the future.
"When I think about retransmission, I think we can solve it," Coker said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning, Sunday and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday with our clock, so Monday with their clock.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed there were many messages circulating and none of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen next time.
We're going to do the five-fight show instead of the six -- as we usually do -- try to do more for the fans and maybe overstep the line.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Disks: Tom Dale felt ‘inferiative' about his sexuality
Olympic diver, Tom Daley, says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality -- but that gave him the motivation to achieve success.
The 24-year-old said he had not understood until he went to nine-year-old school that "not everyone was like me."
Speaking on the first radio 4 program of the 'Desert Island Disks' presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out for homosexual rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that after becoming a parent, he thought less about winning Olympic medals.
The program's permanent host, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off because she is ill.
Showing himself as an outcast in Laverne's first program, Dale said that during his growing time he felt "inferior" to others because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "To date, those feelings of inferiority, and the fact that I felt different, have been the real elements that gave me the impetus and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that it was worth "something," he said, not to disappoint everyone when they found out about his sexual orientation.
Twice the winner of the bronze medal, is already a high profile LGBT activist and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal more to countries to legitimise homosexuality.
He said he came out because he felt fortunate that he was able to live openly and with no consequences and that he wanted to give others "hope."
Three times the world champion said that falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "I was caught up with unprepared."
Last year, Dale married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he is, but said the age difference has never been a problem.
"When he experiences so many things at such an early age" - he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age who had experienced the same landings.
The couple became parents in June, of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley, said his "all prospects" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all I thought was, 'I should win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with head cancer.
Dale said his father didn't admit he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if we had the tickets ready for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'you can't be in the front row, father,'" he said.
"I was holding my hand as he stopped breathing and only after he stopped breathing and passed away for the first time that he was not invincible," he said.
Next year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of the local public at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first musical selection - Proud by Heather Small - which accompanied him in the preparations for the Olympic Games and continues to cause mortar.
Desert Island Disks is presented on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 p.m. with the British clock.
Mickson, out of shape, was left on the bench Saturday at Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match at Ryder Cup, but he will have to change his shape not to turn this historic moment into disappointment.
Mickson, who is the 12th time he's taking part in this event, a separate record of this, organized every two years, was placed on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk during the doubles (fourballs and fuursoms).
Instead of being the center of action, as it has usually been for the United States, the winner of the big titles five times spent the day supporting the team and working in hopes of leaving his concerns behind.
Not among the players with the most straight kick even when he was at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not an appropriate player for Le Golf National's complex field, where long and difficult areas leave no room for wrong shooting.
And if only fear of the court, Mickson, on Sunday, the ninth match will face the 'British Open' champion, Francesco Molinari, who has formed a team with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who have four points less, before they start 12 shots, will start violently, Mickson's game can result in decisive results.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, even though he can't say more than that.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap on the shoulders, threw his hand at my neck and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's at the Hall of Fame and he's contributed a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he was gonna play two games.
I had thought more, but that's how it turned out to be, and that's how we thought it was the solution.
He wants to be in the field, like anyone else."
On Sunday, Mickson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most featured player in the Ryder Cup games.
It may mark the end of his career at the Ryder Cup, where he has failed to measure up to his individual presentations.
Mickson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven drawes, even though Furyk said his presence brings assets to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, sharp, likes to harass people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"Also, I think the youngest players were having fun facing it, during this week, and that was nice to see.
He's giving more than just a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great chairmanship can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience, that the considerable lead they have before their last single day at the Ryder Cup can turn into an unpleasant factor.
Danez made his debut in the 1997 confrontation at Valderrama, where the team of Captain Sever Ballesteros took a lead with five points against the Americans and closed the tournament by winning a very close margin, 141-2-31-2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but very hard," said Bjorn, who was photographed after seeing 5-3 victory in Class 2018 on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 on ‘Le Golf National'.
So history tells me and everyone on that team that it's not over.
Tomorrow we'll take the last march.
We're gonna go in there and we're gonna do the right thing.
Nothing's over until we get the score on the board.
We have a goal, to try to win this trophy and here's our focus.
I've said it all the time, I'm focused on the 12 players we have on the team, but we're aware who we're facing -- the best players in the world."
Happy with his players' productivity on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added, "I don't want to rush at this stage.
Tomorrow we'll face another 'monster'.
Tomorrow individual performances stand out, and this is something else that needs to be done.
It's great when you're on the field with a partner, when things are going well, but when you're alone, then you're tested in your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to convey to the players, tomorrow you must give the best of yourself.
Now, forget your partner as well as he must go and give the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, rival Jim Furyk will hope his players perform better individually than with partners, where the exception is just Jordan Spitth and Justin Thomas, received three out of four possible points.
Furyk himself has experienced both cases of great returns on the last day, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing to what is considered the "Miracle in Medina" of the European team.
"I remember every word," when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had motivated his players during the last day in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we must have a good start, as you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When you get the flow on one side, you put a lot of pressure on the middle fights.
We put the formation based on this and we're going to take the boys out in the order we believe in is the best, as you see, we're trying to achieve a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of starting to reverse the score and he's going to face Rory McIllroy in the front game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Potter are positioning European players in the first half of the rankings.
"I chose this group and in this ranking that I believe it covers all the road to the matches," Bjorn said of his singles selections.
Reassigned Production of the New German Battle
The new German Navy frigate should have been sent in 2014 to replace the Cold War Wartime combat, but will not be ready until next year, due to problematic systems and high costs, local media have reported.
Posting "Heinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the new frigates 'Baden-Weerttemberg-class', was delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper 'Die Zeit' quoted by a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but problems after submitting damaged the fate of the ambitious project.
The four 'Baden-Wuertemberg-class' ships, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, will serve as substitutes for the old 'Bremen-clas' frigates.
It would reportedly contain a powerful ball, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and anti-intelligence technology (stealth), such as radar detection, red infrastructure and sound waves.
Some of the other important features include longer maintenance periods -- it must be possible to transfer the new frigates for more than two years away from the country's ports.
Persistent delays, however, mean that recent technology fighting is said to enable Germany to reflect power abroad - will be outdated as they enter the ministry, writes ‘ Die Zeit.'
F125's “F125” frigated the front pages last year when the German navy officially rejected the order for the ship and turned it into the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time Marina has returned a ship to her builder after his surrender.
Little information was provided on the reasons for the return, but the media in Germany quoted there as a number of "great effects on software and hardware" that made the ship useless during a war mission.
Programming problems were particularly important on the Baden-Weerttemberg-class ships because they will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - half the labor force of the old 'Bremen class' frigates.
It was also found that the ship was extremely overweight, reducing its productivity and restricting Marina’s ability to increase improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Heinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice the weight of similar-class vessels used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the physically troubled parts, the price of the entire project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have amounted to a wordless $3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) — out of the initially projected $2.2 billion.
Problems gripping the new frigates become especially important after recent warnings that the German Navy's power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the defence committee in the German parliament, acknowledged that Marinas are "out of enough ships to move to another country."
The official said the problem had increased over time because old ships had been extracted from use but had not been replaced with new ones.
He lamented that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg-clas' new frigates could join the Navy.
National Trust Watches Secret Life of Bats
A new research being carried out by a company in mountainous areas of Scotland aims to find out how bats use the terrain to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the new findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and will assist protective activities in the future.
Research by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common bats and what are called the soprano pipistrallas, as well as the brown ears and Daubon bats in the Inverwee gardens, at Western Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed at key points throughout the area to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct field studies using hand detectors.
The analysis of the sounds to be carried out by experts for all recordings will determine the frequency of bat sounds and what each species does.
Later, a report will be drawn up and a map of their habitat to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the conclusions will show which habitats are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information would help determine settlement management goods, such as creating pasture grounds and maintaining forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has dropped dramatically over the past century.
They are under threat of construction and developmental work that can affect nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting may also pose a risk, as do sticky letters or chemical components of building materials, as well as domestic animal attacks.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their nighttime hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a cut.
They use a sophisticated technique of finding location through sounds to determine insects and obstacles in flight with accuracy.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 760,000 hectares of land in the country, is very serious about bats.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct studies, nest inspections, and sometimes engage in rescue programs.
The organisation has even set up the first and only reserve in Scotland dedicated to bats in Threave, Dumfrieds and Galloway, which serves as home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
The manager of this reserve, David Thompson, says this place is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have an excellent area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many ancient trees and all the right habitat.
But there's still a lot about bats that remain unknown, so the work we do here and in other places will help us to understand more what they need to be ‘developed'."
It highlights the importance of performing bat control before performing property maintenance because there is the possibility that the unintentional destruction of a nest could kill up to 400 female bats and young people, killing the entire population of an area.
The bats of the night are protected, and the murder, and the harassment, or the destruction of their nests, are illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish employee of the Trust for the Preservation of the Bats of Night, encourages people to become part of the relief effort.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our species, we just don't know how their population is moving."
Ronaldo denies rape charges as lawyers prepare to sue the German magazine
Cristian Ronaldo said the charges of rape against him are "false news," saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German news magazine 'Der Spiegel' which published these charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been charged with raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that he then allegedly paid her $375 000 so she wouldn't talk about the incident.
Speaking in a live video at the Instagram, directed at its 142 million followers, only hours after the release of these claims, Ronaldo, 33, considered the reports "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today, false news," the Golden Ball winner said in front of the camera five times.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is going well," the player added, smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue 'Der Spinegel' for these charges, which they have called "inadmissible reports of suspicion of private life,"
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral damage to the value corresponding to the seriousness of the offense, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident reportedly took place in June 2009, at a Palms Hotel and Kazino suite in Las Vegas.
According to documents presented at the Clark District Court, in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her at anus.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said "99 per cent" he is a "good boy" left in the mud by "one per cent."
The document says Ronaldo confirms that the couple had engaged in sex, but that he was with the acceptance of both sides.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and that she had pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to a solution outside the court because she was "merited by revenge" and that she was worried she would be "publicly tortured."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to restore the agreement because she continues to be traumatised by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid by Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he went to the Italian giants of Juventus in a 100m-euro deal.
Brexit: United Kingdom will “repent forever” for the loss of car manufacturers' status
The United Kingdom "will regret forever" if it loses its world leader's status in auto production after Brex," said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota in the United Kingdom had told the BBC that if Britain were to leave the EU without an agreement, society would temporarily ban production at its factory in Burnston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of delays on the border, in case of non-compliance, would cost the loss of jobs.
The factory in Burn - producing the Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150,000 vehicles last year, up from which 90% were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my judgment, if Britain emerges from the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnston.
Other UK car producers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed fears of leaving the EU without agreement and of how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW said that after Brex will shut down its Mini series factory in a month.
The main concerns are what car manufacturers refer to as the danger of the supply chain in the case of an unannounced Brex.
Toyota's production line operates on "Right away they are ordered," with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers from the UK and the EU, for custom vehicles.
If, on March 29th, the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, there could be delays at the borders, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold at its factory in Derbyshire the inventory of more than a day, the company said, and as a result, production would be halted.
Mr. Clark said Therresa May's plan for future relations with the EU "is specifically designed to avoid these controls at the border."
"We need an agreement.We want to have the best deal that will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the moment, for the sake of using this opportunity," he said of the Today's programme in BBC Radio 4.
"The data, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, shows that we should undoubtedly be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain."
The Toyota could not determine how long the production would be halted, but in long-term terms, warned that increased costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and consequently lead to job reduction.
Peter Tsuvalallaris, who has been working in Burn for 24 years and who is the senior official of the Unite Union at the factory, said members are increasingly concerned: "According to my experience at the moment these jobs are closed, they don't come back.
A government spokesman said, "We have set a punctual and reliable plan for our relationship with the EU in the future."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's summit with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein may be "insulting for another week" as the war for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's election interventions, ties between Trump and Russia's aid staff, and the possibility that the president has obstructed justice.
The discussion of whether Trump will discharge the deputy general prosecutor from office, thus putting the independence of Mueller at risk, is something that has been spreading rumors for months in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein considered setting up a wire to record Trump conversations and the possibility of dismissing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied that news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, amid reports that he was close to resigning.
Contrary to expectations, a meeting of Trump, located at UN headquarters in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he "would prefer" not to unload Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a hearing hearing held by the Senate Judicial Committee, where they testified to Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further deferring the full vote in the Senate.
Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders was present today at Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "There's not a date yet, it can be this week.
But let's see, and I always like to keep the press up-to-date."
Some journalists may object to this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Modernist Chris Wallace raised the question of why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences did not result in discontent with the attitude of TV journalists," though she said, "I will not deny that they attract attention."
It then implied that direct contact will increase between Trump and the press.
"The president conducts more quality guarantee sessions than any other president before him," she said, adding, without citing the data, "We have seen these figures."
There will continue to be press conferences, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the president of the United States, then that's much better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen that we have done it often in recent weeks, replacing press conferences in cases where you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or when attending open sessions or at press conferences with important personalities.
Individual press conferences are rare.
The President probably showed the reason for this fact, this week, in New York, where he made a controlled appearance and, in some strange cases, in front of journalists.
Health Secretary writes to employees from the EU, at NHS Scotland, about fear of Brex
The secretary of health has written to the staff from the EU working at NHS in Scotland to express gratitude on behalf of the country and to the desire to stay even after Brex.
Jeane Freeman, the Scottish Parliament deputy, has sent a letter when there are only less than six months left of the UK's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already taken over to cover the costs of applying for permanent residence status for EU citizens working in public services at the local level.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations have continued on the UK's departure from the EU, approaching making a decision in the autumn.
But the UK government has also intensified its preparations in the case of an open-ended scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you all.
For this reason, I wanted to stress how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Partners from the EU and beyond bring in valuable experience and skills that increase and improve the work of health care, increasing the benefits of patients and communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is obviously your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after injury to the head
Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie's protector underwent immediate surgical surgery after the head injury suffered on Saturday, in a 31-27 defeat against Vanderbilt Kommodors, reported The Tennesseen journalist Mike Organ.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the damage occurred just before the first half.
"He came to the side line and fell there," said Reed.
The trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they put it on the stretch and sent it for further examinations.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville that Abercrombie had completed surgery at the Vanderbilt Hospital Centre.
Harris added that "there are still no details on the type/scale of damage" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, second year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He carried out five interventions Saturday before leaving the game, bringing the total number of interventions during the season to 18.
Foreign national buyers will pay higher stamp taxes when buying a property on the UK
Foreign national buyers will pay higher stamp taxes on buying a property in the UK, and additional money will be used to help the homeless according to the conservative Party's (Tory) new plans.
This move will neutralise the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters
The stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
Treasury department projects to collect as many as 120m GBP annually to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign national buyers will pay higher stamp taxes for buying a property in the UK and additional money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and to "strik" people with high profits.
The stamp tax will apply on individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, while additional money will support the government's initiative to fight housing shortages.
This extra fee - which is added to the current stamp tax, including the increase in tax rates introduced two years ago for second houses and the purchase of properties for rent - could be up to three percent.
The Treasury Department predicts the move will collect as much as 120m GBP annually.
About 13 per cent of the recently built property in London is purchased by vacationers outside the UK, which causes price hikes and makes it more difficult to find housing from buyers for the first time.
Many wealthy areas of the country -- especially in the capital -- have become "snake towns" because of the high number of foreign national buyers spending most of their time abroad.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping high prices by buying land but not putting it into use, and urged Mrs. May to give up quotas for affordable homes in order to regulate Britain's "pour with property."
Mr. Corbyn has proposed some attractive housing reforms, including rent control and the removal of "no reason" evacuations.
Also, he wants to empower the advice to build new homes.
Miss May said, "Last year I declared that I would dedicate the prime minister's mandate to the return of the British dream -- well, a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing the troubled home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
It is not fair, however, that individuals who do not live in the UK and foreign societies have a much easier time buying homes than British workers.
For many people, the dream of owning a house has become something very difficult to achieve, and injustice against the homeless is more than real."
Jack Ross: 'My greatest ambition is to train Scotland'
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's coach at a certain stage.
Scocezi, 42, is enjoying the challenge of revitalising the north-east club, which is currently positioned in third place in the League One (the third category), three points away from the head.
He came this summer to the Light Stadium after returning St Mirren to Premier Scoceze last season.
"I wanted to play for my place as a player.
I showed up once at Representative B, and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsland.
"But as a child I grew up seeing Scotland many times in Hampden with my father, and it's something that's always attracted me.
However, this opportunity will come only if I am successful in running clubs."
Ross' ancestors in the direction of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moses, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach says he is not concerned that he is following the steps of these big names in such a big club, as he has previously turned down offers from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"For the moment, my success will depend on the fact that 'I can turn this team into Premier League?'
Given the structure and facilities of this club, it certainly belongs to Premier League," he said.
"It's not a simple task to go there, but I would see myself as successful only if I could get the club back to Premier League."
Ross has started his career as coach for only three years after a period of assistant coaching in Dumbarton and a 15-month period in Hearts' leadership staff.
He then helped Alloa climb a category higher and up to the third round of the cup, as well as transformed St Mirren from a club near the fall from the category to the winner of the title of Champshipship next season.
And now, Ross says he feels better than he's ever felt in his career as a player for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"Maybe it was really a turning point," he says, for taking the lead of Alloa.
"I really believed that training was the right thing for me, rather than being a player.
It seems strange because I played well, I lived a good life thanks to this profession, and I enjoyed some good achievements.
But being a player can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
Again, I experience a lot of stress and pressure from work, but training seems to be the right job.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing something like that.

According to one study, the perfect time to "drink a beer" is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has raised locals' revenue in the difficult situation in Britain, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data shows that sales in local and bar groups increased by 2.7 per cent in July -- but restaurant purchases dropped by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at the CGA, who compiled the data, said "The continued sundial weather, as well as England's participation in the World Cup longer than expected, influenced July to follow the same trend as June, where local sales rose by 2.8 per cent, while restaurants recorded declines even higher.
Shooting in restaurants dropped by 1.8% in June, and deteriorated further in July.
Bars and locals with the main activity of offering drinks registered the best performance, with higher growth than reducing trade in restaurants.
Locals with major activity food delivery also recognized declines as a result of sunny weather, though not as significant as restaurants.
Looks like people just want to go for a drink.
Sales of drinks in bars and locals rose by 6.6 per cent that month, while food fell by three per cent."
Paul Newman, free time and hospitality analyst in RSM, said, "These results confirm the tendency we have seen since the end of the month of April.
When it comes to sales in the nonhouse market, the weather and impact of important social or sports events remain the main factors.
No wonder restaurant groups continue to face difficulties, although a 4.8 - percent decline in sales each year will have a particularly heavy burden considering constant cost pressure.
Long, hot summers could not come at a more difficult moment for food operators, and time will show whether the average temperatures of August will provide much-needed calm."
The total increase in sales in locals and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launch.
The Coffer Peach Index of Industry Sales, for the UK bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyses data from 47 societies, with a total run of more than 9 billion GBP, and is the reference point of industry.
One in five children have secret accounts in social media that they hide from their parents.
According to one study, one in five children — some not more than 11 years of age — have secret accounts in social media that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 nine-year-old education students showed increased "false Insta" profiles
This news has raised fears of sexual posts
Twenty percent of students said they have a "key" account that they show their parents
One in five children - some of whom are not more than 11 - are opening up accounts in social media that adults secretly use.
A survey of 20,000 nine-year-old education students showed a rapid increase in "false Insta" profiles -- linked to the site for photo distribution, Instagram.
This news has increased the fear of sexually explicit postings.
Twenty per cent of the students said they use a clear "key" account they tell their parents about, but they also have private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, found that a teenager urged others to "rape her."
The study of the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors ("Headmasters and Headmistresses") of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of the age 11 to 18 group had two profiles, and half admitted to having confidential accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchan said, "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create social spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eiconnect Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" on Scotland's Athletics Board.
Eiconnect Doyle has been selected on the Scotland Athletics Board to the post of non-equicutive director of this governing body, during the general assembly's annual meeting.
Doyle is the most decorated sports athlete on track and field, and Chairman Ian Beattie described the decision as a great opportunity for all sports leaders to benefit from its extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eiconnect enjoys massive respect in the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit extremely much by making it part of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am enthusiastic that I will serve as the voice of athletes and I am very much hoping that I will contribute and help in running sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200m and 400m race at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, with four Olympic gold medals in total and who is a regular BBC expert, lost the ability to walk after a temporary stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a blow.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time will tell if I'm healed and to what extent.
It took a grueling job, but I was able to recover fully, learned to walk again, and today I am exercising skills!
Thank you for the encouraging messages."
The breast pump advertising that compares mothers to cows shares public opinion
A breast - pump production company has shared public opinion with an ad that compares cow - milking mothers.
To start promoting what is considered "the world's first silent and soundly breast pump," the consumer technology product society, Elvie, featured a funny music video to promote the freedom this new pump gives to mothers who need to express themselves freely.
Four real mothers jump in a cow stall full of grass to the sound of a song with lyrics like the following: "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, these aren't sis, it's my chest."
The refrain continues: "Pamping, pumping, feeding the babies, pumping, pumping, milking the ladies."
However, the ad, which has been published on the firm's Facebook page, has triggered online debate.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received friendly reactions from viewers, with many expressing it underestimates the "crazies" of the milk industry.
"The use of cows to promote this product is a very poor decision.
Like us, they must remain "sitted" and "born" to produce milk, only their "bebebeths" are taken away from them a few days after they are born," someone wrote.
Elvie Bay pump placed inside rechipes and is not noticed (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Clearly traumatic for the mother and child.
Why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can hold their babies?"
Someone else added, "What advertisements without sensitivity."
Others supported the ad, among which one woman admitted that the song seemed "funny."
"I think this is a genius idea.
I would have bought one if you were still breastfeeding the baby.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I saw what it means.
This is a genius product," someone wrote.
Another commented: "This is a funny advertisement directed at mothers who use the pump (of times in the workplace or in the toilet) and who feel like "lopas."
This is not an ad that praises or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women's group shows that they've all danced with the hidden pump on the rechipes.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the record that many women using breast pumps say that they feel that cows.
However, the Elvie pump is silent, has no wires or pipes, is placed inside the recipers, and is inconsistent, giving females freedom to move, keep their babies, and even step outside while they use it.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD (Complementary Creative Director) in Mother commented: "The Elvis pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative promotion.
By drawing a parallel between the women who want to express themselves freely and the milk cows, we wanted to point out the use of the breast pump and the challenges they face, also displaying in a funny and similar way the extraordinary sense of freedom the new pump gives.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has come to the front page.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared in the background of designer Marta Yakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children have moved quietly into a tent camp on the border of Texas
The number of banned child immigrants has increased even though the number of monthly crossings to the border has remained relatively same, partly due to the rhetoric and strict policies presented by the Trump administration that have made sending children to their supporters difficult.
Usually, most supporters have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and have been afraid to risk their stay in the country by trying to apply for a baby.
The danger increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adult persons of the same family would have to give fingerprints, and that data would pass on to immigration authorities as well.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Migration and Customs Agency, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 per cent of the people arrested had no prior criminal precedent.
"About 80 per cent of individuals who are supporters or members of the family of supporters stay in the country illegally, and a large part of them are foreigners with criminal precedents.
So, we are continuing to follow these individuals," Mr. Albence said.
According to housing officials, trying to process children’s records more quickly, officials introduced new regulations requiring some of them to appear in court within a month at the time of the ban and not 60 days later, as was the previous standard.
Many of them will be presented before immigration judges through videoconferencing, rather than physically, to argue with their request for legal status.
Those who do not qualify will be deported immediately.
According to housing workers and reports taken by the system in recent months, the longer children are banned, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which could lead to violent explosions or escape attempts.
Proponents say that these concerns are more severe in areas such as Tornillo, where the size of the child is more likely to overlook signs showing that a child has difficulty.
They add that moving children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good - bye to their friends can cause trauma that many of them already face.
Syria asks American, French and Turkish "invasion forces" to withdraw immediately
During his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mowalem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has already entered the eighth year.
Mowalem, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, stated that foreign forces remain in Syrian land illegally, on the grounds that they fight terrorism, and that "they will deal with them in the proper way".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said during the assembly.
Mowalem insisted that "the war against terror has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have been deported from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight in this holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories" both of the terrorist groups and of the "illegal foreign forces".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which mainly train and advise the Kurdish forces and Arab Syrians that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on this war-torn country's territory.
On the refugee issue, Mowalem said the conditions are good for them to return, and blamed "some Western countries" for "opening irrational fears" driving refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They are politicising an issue, which should be fully humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide assistance to rebuilding Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last major fortress of rebels at Idlib has created opportunities to move ahead with political discussions.
The Russia-Turkey agreement avoided a large-scale attack of Russian-backed Syrian forces in this province, where three million people live.
However, Mowalem underlined that the agreement had "clear guidelines" and voiced confidence that military attacks would target jihadists, including fighters from Al-Qaeda Front Nusra, who "will be eliminated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon call the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mowalem set out the conditions for the government's participation in this committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited "to reviewing the provisions of the current constitution," and warned there should be no interference.
Why Trump wants to win a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will be re-elected in 2020 except when, as many people with liberal views hope, accusations and scandals end his presidency prematurely.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of a presidency in history!"
So far, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers during peak hour has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and has nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average audience of 2.4 million during peak hour, up from 1.7 million four years ago, while the MSNBC programme, "The Rachel Maddow Show", reached the top of the cable channels' score with 3.5 million viewers during the big event evenings.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, head of the dramatic series at ABC "Designed Survivor," which tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Fee Hard Truths About the Hollywood Boys," has another theory.
It reminisces a taxi ride to Boston ahead of the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked him.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
There's fun value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families can unite and the health of the global economy.
Ignoring is a luxury that only the most privileged audience can afford.
Yet, if you find yourself after six hours watching a panel of experts debate the use of "undisputed information" by Bob Woodward in his book "Hell," the ostrich skin bomb of Paul Manafort, worth 15,000 USD ("a clothesful with arrogance," The Washington Post) said, as well as the implications of Stormy Daniels' vivid descriptions, of Mr. Trump's anatomy, then it goes beyond being an informed citizen.
At least I'll never see Super Mario again the same way.
"One part of what he does and that makes it look like a 'reality show' is that he feeds you with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," about the circulating actors and the unexpected developments of Trump's programme (debats with N.F.L., praises to Kim Jong.).
You can't leave an episode without watching or you're left behind.
When I went to Mr. Fleiss this week, the weather was sunny and the outside temperature was 80 degrees, outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was hiding inside, watching MSNBC, while registering CNN.
He couldn't leave, not while Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging on a par.
"I remember when we carried out all those crazy programmes in the past and the people who said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside the private sector pours in the tight race for Congress elections
It is no surprise that the 17th Pennsylvania area is facing an influx of cash due to the reorganisation of electoral zones obliging the two officials in office to run for the same post.
This recent reorganisation in the suburbs of Pittsburgh has installed Democrat representative Conor Lamb, who won the post in another area in the special elections last spring.
Lamb is running against another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th old zone, which has been overlapping.
This new map division came after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision, which in January said that the old areas were unconstitutionally and unfairly assigned in favor of the Republicans.
This race, in the new area 17, has also fostered a strong fight in financing campaigns from the main party funding bodies, the Democratic Committee for Congress Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Committee for Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrowly resulting victory in the March 18th special elections widely attended for Pennsylvania's 18th election zone.
For more than a decade, that post was held by the Republicans, and President Donald Trump won the area by 20 points.
Political experts see the Democrats as easy favourites.
US considers penalising El Salvador for support of China, then withdraws
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little incentive from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the management team of the Trump Organisation.
State Department officials decided to remove the American chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," the department's spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said during a statement earlier this month.
But criminalties were only reviewed against El Salvador, which received an aid of about 140 million USR from America in 2017, including control of narcotics, development and support of the economy.
The proposed penalties, which included reductions of financial assistance and restrictions on visa delivery, would be serious for the Central American country and for its high levels of unemployment and murder.
As domestic meetings achieved progress, officials from countries of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic well-being to attend a similar meeting last year, a move seen as a step in efforts to prevent immigrants from heading towards the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conferences to be held, ending any possibility of imposing criminalties against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to deliver a speech at the conference, which is envisioned in mid-October, a signal that shows the importance the administration devotes to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys, they came quietly back from El Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic, without strong messages or punishment from Washington.
A White House official for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal discussions on the condition that their anonymity be maintained.
Their explanations were confirmed by an analyst close to the administration, who also spoke, demanding the right to anonymity.
Study History
The next event to take place could be Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller's report on possible obstruction by Mr. Trump, for which there is considerable evidence in public data.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller is shifting his investigation to prove whether during his campaign, Mr. Trump has collaborated with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If Congress changes arm, Mr. Trump will have to answer to this body at a time when he prepares to appear before voters again, and perhaps eventually he can face an independent jury.
These are if, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall -- or that of his counterparts in Europe -- is inevitable.
All of us, from both sides of the Atlantic, have to make choices that will affect how long the conflict will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to take a coup against Hitler if the West had resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on these turning points, which accelerate or delay the relentless journey of democracy.
Currently, Americans face some of these turning points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump sacks Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fates of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has not been in a difficult situation since this newspaper reported, over the past year, that he had suggested secretly spying on the president, and speculated that he is not fit to stay in office.
Mr Rosenstein said that The Times article is incorrect.
"How will we respond if the new investigation sought by the F.B.I. to Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed at the Supreme Court despite charges based on sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the upcoming elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump responsible?
If we fail at these tests, then democracy will face a long winter.
But I believe that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that invaded the residence of ambassadors in which I lived.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me a candle of Sabbath to that table bearing the symbol of swastika (broken cross).
Having this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers player Graham Dorans is optimistic before facing Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, Rangers wait for Rapid Vienna given that a victory in front of the Austrians, following the impressive drawing in Spain in front of Willarreal, earlier this month, would place them in a favourable position to qualify in Group G, the League of Europe.
A knee injury did not allow the Graham Dorans midfielder to make the first appearance this season in the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a push to achieve larger things.
"It was an important point for us because Willarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We entered the field believing that we could get something and came out with a point.
We may have scored at the end, but in general, I believe the equalization was a fair result.
Maybe they were better at the first part as we showed up in the second half and we were the best team.
On Thursday, it will be another big European evening.
I hope we can get the three points but it'll be a tough match because they achieved a positive result in their last match, but, with supporters, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was very difficult, due to injuries suffered and changes in the club, but now there is a positive factor on this team.
The team is fine, and the boys are enjoying it very much; the training goes well.
I hope we can move forward, throw the last season behind us and succeed."
Females sleep less as a result of fear of retirement savings
Although the study participants had a clear idea of how we wanted family members to take care of them, very few spoke to them about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationship study said they talked to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent responded that they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the society for life insurance, Nationwide.
That's where we have to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you unless you first show your wishes.
Work with the counselor and your family, and discuss where and how to take care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Also take your financial adviser: the Councillor can help you find a way to pay your expenses.
Options for financing long-term care include a traditional security policy for long-term care, hybrid police for life insurance savings to help cover these spending or self-security through your wealth - as long as you have money.
Prepare legal documents: Avoid legal battles through authorisation.
Take a healthcare prosecutor and assign a trusted person who will monitor your health care and ensure that experts act in line with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also consider receiving a procurement for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions in your name and guarantee payment if you cannot do so yourself.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer the questions about the allergies and the medications you receive?
Prepare a written plan for these details so that you are ready.
"Not only is the financial aspect at stake, but also who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What medication will be used?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare this plan."
One person gets shot several times with air rifles in Ilfracombe
One man was shot several times with an air rifle as he went home after spending the evening outside.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area, in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers claimed this was a "autocidal act", which occurred at around 0230 BST.
The victim did not see the aggressor.
Injured injuries pose no threat to life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian town of Palu on Friday, officials have declared that the death toll is expected to rise.
With out-of-function communications networks, welfare workers have failed to obtain information from the Donggala regent, an area north of Palu, which was closer to the 7.5-point earthquake epicentre.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after this catastrophe.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and a tsunami.
Donggala is a regent extending more than 300km (180 km) of coastline length to the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
Regence, a region smaller than the province, had an estimated population of about 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and livestock are the province's main economic activities, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Neicel extraction is also important in the province, but it is focused mainly on Morowal, on the other side of the Sulawesi coast.
According to the Indonesia Catastrophic Abuse Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by the tsunami over the past 100 years.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, another tsunami hit the western part of Donggala, causing nine casualties.
Indonesia is located in the seismic region of the Pacific Fire Ring and is regularly struck by earthquakes.
The following are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26th, a powerful earthquake on the western coast of the province of Aceh in Indonesia in the northern part of Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 states, causing 226,000 victims along the Indian Ocean coastline, of which more than half lived in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds lost their lives on the island of Nias Island, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed about 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake measuring 7.6 in the vicinity of the town of Padang, capital of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1100 people were dead.
2010 A 7.5 - size earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai in Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 30 feet [10 m] that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya regent in Aceh, bringing disaster and panic to people after reminding them of the destruction caused by the earthquake and the deadly tsunami of 2004.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people lost their lives to the collapse of buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquakes hit Lombok’s tourist island, claiming more than 500 lives, most of them on the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Paulin's eldest son has been arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Paulin, the eldest son of the former Alaska governor and vice candidate for president, Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of aggression.
According to a report presented on Saturday by the Alaska State Police, Paul, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as family violence suspect, obstructing family violence reporting, and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when a known woman tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he picked up her phone.
Paul is being held in the Mat-Su detention facility and is being held in the form of uninsured bonds worth $500, KTUU reported.
According to reports by this network, he appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked about admitting guilt, he said "he is absolutely innocent".
Paul faces three category A violations, which means he can be imprisoned by one year and fines $250,000.
Also, he has been charged with a B-class violation, which is sentenced to one day in prison and $2000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been brought against Paul.
In December 2017, he was charged with attacking his father, Todd Paul.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently being considered by the Veterans' Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence, and drunken weapons during the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he had punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Paulin was criticised by veterans’ groups for linking her son's violent behavior with PTK (post-traumatic stress syndrome) as a result of his service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people lost their lives on Friday, due to an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5 - size earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are out of service, and the death toll is expected to rise over the next few days.
The quake hit the central part of Sulawesi, located in northeast Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social media that show the moment of the shock.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for terrorist attack suspect in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York but seek the death penalty for Sayfo Saipo Saipov, the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare sentence that has not been handed down for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out the terrorist attack on a bicycle route along the western highway, in lower Manhattan, stepping foot and cycling.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov has killed the eight victims "meditally" and that it has caused "meditiously" serious bodily injuries, according to the letter meant to seek the death penalty, handed down in New York's southern district.
According to a court document, both charges could be given the death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a major federal jury placed Saipov in front of 22 lawsuits, including eight counts of murder in aid of organised crime, charges often used by prosecutors in organised crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
This attack has come as a result of "a considerable and premeditated planning," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov executed the crime as "disgusting, cruel and without morals."
"Saykullaevic Saipov caused injuries, injuries and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Clives, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damgnucco," reads in the letter of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time New York's southern district prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used in a federal case in New York, it was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of committing conspiracy and spying for the benefit of the Soviet Union, two years before the Cold War.
Both were executed in electric chairs on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, of Uzbekistan nationality, showed no repentance during the days and months following the attack.
He has declared to the investigators that he feels good about what he did, the police reported.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his mobile phone.
Police said he had also sought to plant the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He has declared he is innocent of 22 indictments.
David Patton, one of the public lawyers representing Saipov, said they are "very disappointed with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty, and no guilty confession, accompanied by life imprisonment without access, will increase even more the trauma caused by these events to all the persons involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had earlier asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative Party MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be placed at the helm of Brex negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised today, during a protest at the Conservators' conference, that he would "mobilize the people's army".
The former UKIP leader said politicians should 'feel the pressure' of Eurosceptics -- after one of the deputies of Theresa May suggested he should be at the helm of negotiations with the EU.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK 'would be off' if Brex's secretary were Mr. Farage.
But the challenge facing Mrs. Mayy to join her grouping is noted by the pro-EU conservatives who joined another protest in the city against Brex.
The prime minister is facing difficulties in implementing the compromise plan reached at Chequers, amid attacks coming from those who want the position or departure from the European Union, as well as from the EU itself.
Allies insist that it will attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels despite harsh reactions - and will force Eurosceptics and labourers to choose between its package and chaos'.
In the course of the Displacement March means evacuation, Mr. Bone said he wants to abandon the Chequers deal.
He suggested that Mr. Faraj should be put in charge and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he were in charge, now we'd be out,' he said.
Wellingbough MP added, 'I will support Brex but we must abandon the Chequers agreement.'
Expressing his stance against the EU, he said, "We did not fight in world wars to be in subjection.
We want to draft our laws in our country.''
Mr. Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue.'
Conservatory Andrea, who supports Brex, was also on the march and said to reporters: "I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
''The Chequers Agreement is not supported by the general public, the opposition will not vote on it, support within our party either, and by activists filling the streets and voting us.
Please abandon the Chequers and start listening.'
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: 'The prime ministers keep the job when they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage said during the march that politicians should 'feel pressure' if they are thinking of abandoning the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'Now, it's a question of faith between us -- the people -- and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brex and we're here today to tell 'we won't let you do something like that'.'
During a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want you to force our political class, which is close to abandoning Brex, to feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country that gave us the victory in Brex and we will not stop until the United Kingdom is independent, proud and government itself.
Meanwhile, they marched to Birmingham before holding a two - hour gathering in the city center.
A small group of activists held banners writing against Brex Conservators after this grouping show at the weekend.
The sponsor of labers Lord Adonis ironied with conservatives about the security problems they had with a "social application", during the start of the conference.
These are the people who tell us they can prepare TI systems and the technology needed for "Canada plus" -- for open borders, for free free trade with Ireland," he added.
It's totally a farce.
There is no such thing as the good Brex,' he said.
Warren plans to 'consider carefully' the possibility of running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren has announced that she will "carefully review the possibility of running for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that Massachusetts's Democrat Senator spoke about its future during a meeting in City Hall held on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a constant critic of President Donald Trump, has been running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-director of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It has been at the centre of speculation that it could run against Trump in 2020.
The meeting organised Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with the electors according to the municipal format, since Trump came to the top.
One of the participants asked him if he is planning to run for president.
Warren replied that the time has come for "the children to go to Washington and fix the broken government, and that includes putting a woman in charge."
LSU team player, Wayde Sims, is arrested
Police at Baton Rouge, La., reported Saturday he has arrested a suspect in the murder of basketball player Wayde Sims during Friday.
Dutheon Simpson, 20, was arrested about 11am, the Baton Rouge Police Department announced through a media conference.
Police had released a shooting video on Friday seeking help to identify the person shown there.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near South University campus during Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims passed away as a result of gunshot wounds caused to the head," Murphy J. Paul said Saturday 247sports, chief of police.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene, carrying a gun, and he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and sent to custody at the police department in the eastern region of Baton Rouge.
Sims, who's tall 6'6', played 32 matches, of which 10 as a title, last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 balls on the board for matches.
Russia's Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title as team instructions give Sebastian Vettel victory
From the moment Walter Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes team instructions would play a considerable role in the race.
Bottas left the first country and almost "trolled" Hamilton after defending his position on the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his team mate.
Vettel was the first to make a stop and let Hamilton compete in the "traffe" at the end of the car heap, something that should have resulted in decisive results.
Mercedes made the stop a ride later and was positioned after Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after several manoeuvres that forced the Ferrari pilot to leave space inside after a double move to defend himself at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started the race from the back row and at the end of the first lap was ranked seventh, on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then took the lead in a large part of the race after failing to change the tires to reach a fast finish, and passed Kimi Rakkonen by ranking fourth.
Eventually, he made a stop on the 44th lap, but failed to improve the pace on the remaining eight laps, leaving Rakkonen's fourth place.
It's a tough day because Walter did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team has done an extraordinary job with these exchange positions," Hamilton said.
We use our body language very weak
President Donald Trump ignored Senator Diane Feinstein during a rally Saturday, over her insistence, that it was not the person who "intended" Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, of sexual assault.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony given before the Senate Judicial Committee, but said what was happening in the Senate shows that people are "wicked, bad and insincere."
"The only thing that can happen and the beauty of what's going on in the Senate over the last few days is when you look at anger, when you see people being angry, wicked, bad and insincere," he said.
"When you look at the publications secretly put out and then people who say "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, were you the ones who put the letter out?
Remember her answer... did you draw the document-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't bring it out."
Wait a minute.
We did not... No, we didn't," he said, imitating the senator.
In July, Feinstein was sent letters with details of the accusations against Kavanaugh by Ford, and the document was issued earlier in September -- but Feinstein denied that the information had come out of her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't bring up her story," Feinstein told the commission, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it that way, as she asked me to."
Her denial was apparently not acceptable to the president, who commented during the Saturday evening debate: "In my opinion, the gestures really left for wishful thinking.
Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen more subtle gestures before."
Taking into his defense the candidate for the Supreme Court, who is accused by three women of indecent sexual behavior, the president indicated that the Democrats are using alleged charges to achieve their goals.
"They are determined to regain power at all costs.
They don't care who they hurt, who they should step in to take power and control," the media reported as words spoken by the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scores twice for Giants versus Dundee
Dundee Stars compensated for Friday's defeat against Belfast Giants, at a valid challenge for the Elite League, winning on Saturday the 5-3 match of return in Dundee.
The Giants went swiftly to the double advantage due to the blows of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the score for the local team before Dwyer returned the Giants to the advantage.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals provided him with victory.
This was the third loss of the season, at the Elite League, for the faithful of Adam Keefe, who, on Friday evening, returned from the disadvantage, to defeat Dundee 2-1, in Belfast.
This was the fourth confrontation between these teams, this season, with the first three ever won by Giants.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from Kendall McFul's assistant, and David Rutherford gave the Assist to Bewvilleer, who doubled the score four minutes later.
During a first intensive part, Sullivan returned the locals to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt assisted the Cownie draw at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants got the advantage before the break by scoring his second goal of the evening, at the end of the first half.
The locals regrouped and Buchard returned the draw with a sharp kick at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined among themselves by assisting Nielsen, who gave Dundee the advantage for the first time in this challenge, at the end of the second half, and secured his team's victory with the fifth goal, scored in the last half.
Giants, who have missed four of the last five meetings on Friday, will play the next game at home against Milton Keynes.
Air traffic controller loses his life, making sure hundreds of people on a plane escape the earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being honored as a hero after losing his life, ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people would land safely.
More than 800 people lost their lives and many others have been reported missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong waves continue to disturb the area, and many are trapped in the town of Palu.
But despite having his colleagues fled to safety, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agong refused to leave his post at the control tower shaking violently at Palu Airport "Mutiara Sis Al Ufri Airport".
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air's 6321 aircraft, which was on the runway at the moment, could be safely launched.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was coming down.
He later lost his life in the hospital.
"Air Navigation Indonesia" spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's "ABC News" reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he lost his life this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"This news breaks our souls," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, while the local disaster related agency says entry into the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
It is believed that this number will continue to rise, as there are still many bodies under the rubble, while others have not been found," said the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves reaching up to six metres have destroyed Paluna, where a massive Mortore ceremony will be held on Friday.
Military jets and merchants are bringing supplies and relief supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said of the "Sky News" "Every minute the ambulance brings troops.
There's no clean water.
Mini-markets have been looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said of CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
The president of Indonesia, Yoko Widodo, arrived on Sunday in Palu and addressed the country's army: "I am asking you to work day and night to carry out every task related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people lost their lives.
A plane crash in Micronesia: "Air Niugini" now says a person is missing after a plane crashed into the lagoon.
The airline heading a plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon of Micronesia now declared a missing person after declaring that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated by the underwater plane.
In a press release, "Air Niugini" said Saturday afternoon they were not finding a passenger.
The airline said it was collaborating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in an effort to find the person.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been escorted to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and that all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the consequences themselves remain unclear.
The U.S. airline and navy said the plane landed in the lagoon after failing to reach the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
"It's an extremely good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that through the water that had reached its waist level, he and other people managed to reach the emergency exits of the plane.
He said the stewards were panicking and shouting while he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working on repairing a nearby scaffold helped save them by using an airboat to transport people ashore before the plane sank to about 100m (100 feet) under water.
Data from the Aviation Security Network shows 111 people have lost their lives in the clash of airlines registered at PNG in the last two decades, but "Air Niugini" was not involved in any of them.
The analyst builds chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution presented her arguments to the retrial of a person accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
American Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours, in the quality of the expert in the field of data analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used phone data to rebuild the movement of the defendant, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night it changed lives.
According to reports by The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have obtained the location data from several mobile phones showing that the Tellis was with Chambers on the afternoon of her death, the one that refutes his earlier claims.
When the data found out that his cell phone was in the same place as Chambers while he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, then the police went to talk to him.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When asked by prosecutors whether Tellis was telling the truth when he declared that he was in Sanford's truck that evening, he said "he's lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies is the statement by Tellis, who said he had recognised Chambers about two weeks before she died.
The phone files showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis had erased messages, calls and contact data from his phone.
"He swept it out of his life," said Hale.
The defence side is designed to issue closing arguments Sunday.
The judge said the jury would make the verdict that very day.
What's the conscious hip hop?
A three-member hip-hop group seeks to challenge this genre's negative views by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Break, from Bristol, claim that hip-hop is alienated from his origin of political messages and messages that addressed social issues.
They want to come back to origin and make it re-recognizable hip-hop.
In the UK, a resurface of artists like The Fugees and Comeon has been observed in contrast with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another colored man?
The nanny from New York sues the couple for leaving work after getting the message "racist"
A New York babysitter has indicted a couple for delinquency discrimination after receiving a malpractice message from a mother who complains that she was "another colored man."
The couple have denied that they are racist, viewing the indictment as "snapping."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed concern when she discovered that the young nanny Giselle Maurice was a colored woman, the moment she appeared on her first day of work in 2016.
"YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, A MAN WITH A NEAR," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing its gaffe, Plasco-Flaxman, "feeling uncomfortable", dismissed Mrs. Maurice, on the grounds that their current nanny, who was African-American, had done a poor job and that instead, she wanted a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her single day's work and then sent home with a dime in her pocket.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for firing, and is demanding compensation at the cost of $350 a day for a six-month period, for which they were hired, even without a contract.
"I want to show them that they should not do such things," she said Friday for The Post, adding "I know it is discrimination."
The couple have denied claims that they are racist, saying Maurice's departure was appropriate, as they feared they could no longer trust him after having offended him.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racist," the husband Joel Plasco for The Post.
"But would you leave the children in the hands of a person to whom you have been rude, even though mistakenly?
Your newborn baby?
Tell me."
Viewing the indictment as "a hunt," Plasco said he and his wife had brought a child to life two months ago and were in a "very difficult situation."
"Can you avenge someone in this situation?
It's not something positive to do," Plasco, investment banker added.
While the case has gone to court, public opinion has quickly denounced the couple in social media, criticising them for their behaviour and logic.
A new letter shows that Paddington publishers feared that readers would not establish links with a talking bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about this letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the place of a person who reads it for the first time before it was published.
We feel a great satisfaction now that we have seen Paddington's extraordinary success."
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before he was inspired by a little toy bear to write the book for children, would have been upset if his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication last year following his death contained "suffering and happiness".
As for Paddington, which she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of the success.
"He was a quiet person and did not boast," she said.
"Paddington was so real to him that it was like having a child who succeeds: you feel proud of him even though it's not exactly your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington's very character."
My daughter was changing her life and I was forced to say goodbye by phone.
Upon arrival, her daughter was urgently taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors had tried to save her life but without result.
"Nad regularly called me to tell me that it was too heavy, which he didn't believe would succeed," said Mrs. Edna-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad who told me she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Now, I love you, baby.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medication doctors had given her to keep her heart at work was losing effect and leaving her system slowly.
She had died a long time ago, and now everything was "fixing".
I was forced to sit and wait, knowing this was happening.
I could not mourn or shout because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to be strong."
In time Mrs. Edna-Laperouse, mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers - who were unaware of what she was experiencing.
"No one knew," she said.
"I kept my head down and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during that flight I felt a great pity for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Fare - bearing women post letters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted letters of inspirational messages on a bridge in Wales as well as phone numbers of people who can call for support.
Mrs. Davis's son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, visiting Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a "sticky" smile.
"Everyone knew about his smile.
People always said that his smile shines every room."
However, he gave up his job before changing his life, as he was "at a very dark moment."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after he had committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly worried that there will be a domino effect."
Mrs. Davis created the papers so people can know that there are people who can help them and who they can talk to, even with a friend.
Don't sit in solitary -- you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been Mrs. Davies's friend for many years, lost Mark, her 15-year partner, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt upset, depressed or anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed the change in behavior.
He was extremely upset on Christmas Day -- when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eye and he didn't take any action."
She said his death was a major trauma to them, but that they must overcome: "It's something that destroys the whole family.
We destroyed us.
But we must all move forward and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on edge after FBI investigation starts.
"I thought that if we could give him something like what he was asking for - a limited time-in-the-art investigation - maybe we could bring some harmony," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee was "distracting" amid numerous obstacles to the opponents.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Their hesitation comes entirely as a result of time.
Congress elections are only 5 weeks away, November 6 - if Republicans fare badly, as expected, they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to elect the person they want at the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has called the senators, lobbying for them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
It will be voted in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear if Mr. Kavanaugh can muster at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to end this situation and confirm at the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea falls under Kim’s leadership
The number of deserters in North Korea has declined since Kim Jong came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has declared.
Park Byion-seug, citing data from the Union Ministry in South Korea, has declared there were about 1127 defections last year -- compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the main factors were the strictest controls on the borders between North Korea and China, as well as the highest tariffs demanded by human traffickers.
Penon did not make public comments.
The majority of deserters from North Korea receive citizenship from South Korea.
Seoul has stated that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most leave China, which has the largest length of the border with North Korea and can be passed over more simply than the DMZ (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is protected by multiple forces.
China considers deserters illegal and not refugees and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Penian, and their talks focused on delayed negotiations for deunclearisation.
This meeting came after the historic meeting of June, between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore, where they agreed, in general terms, to work for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress until that moment.
"Without faith in the US, there will be no faith in our national security, and in these circumstances, there is no chance that we, unilaterally, should be disarmed first," Mr. Ri said during a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," and says he is not worthy to serve at the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, named High Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh "histrich" and said that because of his temperament, he was unable to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelos made these comments Saturday during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help wondering if a woman had ever behaved like that, people would say 'hysterical,'" Pelos said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh flatly denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both of them were teenagers.
During his presentation talk, Kavanaugh was very upset and at some point he almost screamed or stuttered when talking about his family and his high school years.
He accused the Democrats expressly before the committee, calling the charges against him "a grotesque and co-ordinated assassination to his image", organised by liberals angered by the loss of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi expressed her opinion that Kavanaugh’s testimony provided evidence that he could not serve at the Supreme Court because it showed his prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he criminalised himself with those statements and with the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats", she said.
Pelosi hesitated to answer the question of whether he would try to grant Kavanaugh a no-confidence motion in case of his appointment, and in case the Democrats won most of the seats in the House of Representatives.
"Let me tell you -- if he's not telling the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he's indistinguishable not only to the Supreme Court, but also to the court where he is now," Pelos said.
Kavanaugh is currently the judge at the Appeal Court in Washington.
Pelos added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decisions against the Law on Sustainable Care or on the Roe case against Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At hearings for his appointment, Kavanaugh avoided questioning whether he would abolish certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It is not the time for a hysterical and unilateral person to become a member of the court and to expect us to say "o how good!" Pelos said.
And women should use it.
It's a fair verbal attack, months and years of anger that explodes, and it can't get to the bottom without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later.
"Don't think it's unusual.
She went on, "A woman who worked at a leading position, who said that she too cried when she was angry, but she had devised a style that every time she started to get angry and cry, said to her interlocutor, "You might think that I'm upset and that's why I'm crying.
But I'm actually angry."
And then she kept talking.
And I thought this was a brilliant idea."
Tears are a way of expressing anger, in part because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my vivid memories of an old job, in an office where I found myself crying out of overwhelming rage, was the moment when a bigger woman grabbed me for my throat - a cold manager who I've always been somewhat afraid of - pushed me down the stairs.
"Never let others see you crying," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're upset and they're gonna be glad they made you upset."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat member of Congress from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his candidacy for president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found in the midst of an extramarital affair aboard a boat named "Monkey Business" and thrown out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder, extremely angry, realized there was no reason why he wouldn't even think about running for president himself.
"This was not a well-insighted decision," she said laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone called it "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Since the campaign was in its final stages, she was left behind with the collection of funds, so she vowed that she would not compete unless she could raise $2 million.
But it was a futile fight.
She found that some of her supporters who gave her $100 men, she was given $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
During the talk where she announced that she would not carry out an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotion - gratitude for people who supported her, anger with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and resentment with sexism - that she drowned.
"I looked like I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about the way the press reacted to it.
"It looked like Cleenex was my sponsoring corporation.
I remember thinking about what people would write on my tombstone?
"She cried?"
US-China trade war advantages for Beijing
The first wars of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and as the war is far from over, a division between the two countries could be a long-term advantage for Beijing, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year, imposing taxes on China's main export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation was what happened this week, when new tariffs affected goods worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), effectively taxing half the goods that entered the U.S. from China.
Beijing has retaliated every time "in nature", finally placing tariffs of between five and ten per cent over 60 billion dollars in American goods.
China has pledged to repay the US with the same currency, and the second largest economic power in the world is unlikely to surrender soon.
The removal of measures from Washington means surrendering in the face of their demands, but for China's president, Xi Jinping, it would be very embarrassing to publicly bow before the US.
However, experts said that if China plays its letters properly, the pressures stemming from the US trade war can positively support China in long term, to reduce the interdependence of these two economies.
"The fact that political decisions, taken rapidly in both Washington and Beijing, can cause economic decline in each of these countries, is something far more dangerous than the one seen from the outside," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher at the research centre for new American security, who focuses on the Asian continent.
Syria is 'ready' for refugee returns, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moalem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Currently, there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to their country, where they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that hit their daily lives and their well - being.
The UN estimates that about 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
About six million others still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moalem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed state.
He stressed, however, that the country will not accept assistance or conditional assistance from countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup trophy in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup 2018 trophy after defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5, at Le Golf National, just outside Paris, France.
The United States has already lost 6 consecutive matches in European territory, and has been winning this trophy in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team, managed to get the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickson, who was the most difficult player he faced during the tournament, took the first blow to the water and closed the 16th hole with three shots over the level, losing the match to Franesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming 1 of the 4 players who have achieved the score 5-0 since the actual format began to apply in 1979.
The American Jordan Spiteth was defeated 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olessen.
The number one player in the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poutler, who may have played in his final play on the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has played in eight Ryder Cup, became the most successful European player of all time in the tournament, with 25.5 points in career.
"Usually, I don't cry, but today I can't support myself.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm very, very happy we recovered the cup.
The success is the team's, and I'm happy I had the opportunity to help them," Garcia said very excited after the European team's victory.
He passed the word to his fellow international John Ram, who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods, in direct challenges Sunday.
"I feel an extraordinary pride that I defeated Tiger Woods. I grew up watching that player," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his matches in France and now has statistics 13-21-3, during his career in Ryder Cup.
A bizarre statistic by one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 key titles, ranking second after Jack Nicklaus.
The US team faced difficulties throughout the weekend to bring the ball to the right spot, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf along the entire tour.
The US captain, Jim Furyk, spoke after the disappointing performance of his team, "I'm proud of these guys.
There were a few moments this morning when we put pressure on the European team.
We fought hard.
Congratulations, Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players played quite well.
We'll regroup, work with the PGA in America as well as with our Ryder Cup committee and move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be the captain.
We need to take his hat off.
They played better than we did."
