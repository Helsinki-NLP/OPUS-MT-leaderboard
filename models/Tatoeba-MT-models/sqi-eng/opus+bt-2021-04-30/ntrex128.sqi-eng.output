Welsh Assembly members concerned that "looking like fools"
Among some members of the Assembly has spread a concern over the proposal for changing their title to the MWP (The Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This has come as a result of plans to change the name of the assembly to the "Parliament of Wales".
Members of the Assembly from all over the political spectrum are concerned this could spur ridicule.
A Lamburist Party assembly member said his group was concerned "that this rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welles, twp means "dulla" and pwp means "caka".
A Welsh Party MP said that the whole group was "satisfied" and has proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open-minded" about changing the name, but said there was very little distinction between the words "MWP" and "Buddalla".
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter "w" in Welsh is similar to that of the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, currently drafting legislation for the proclamation of the name change, said, "Of course the final decision for naming members of the Assembly will depend on members themselves."
The law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the Tamil Welsh assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission released the results of a consultation with the public, and its proposal for the assembly's appointment as the "Parliament of Wales" found extensive support.
On the issue of the title of the members of the Assembly, the Commission favoured the designation "Messings of the Welsh Parliament" or "WMP", but the "MWP" option found more support in a consultation with the public.
Apparently, the members of the Assembly are suggesting alternative elections, but the struggle for reaching consensus can turn into a headache for Chairman Elin Jones, of which legislation on changes is expected within a few weeks.
Legislation on the reforms will include other changes regarding the way the assembly functions, including regulations on the exclusion of Assembly members and the structure of the committee system.
During the discussion of the legislation, the final vote over the issue of their appointment will be left to the members of the Assembly.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name.
On Sunday, voters will vote for changing their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote by the people was decided in an attempt to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia itself.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name constitutes a claim on its territory and has consistently rejected its requirements for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a referendum opponent for changing the name, has indicated he will not recognise the polls.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
St Martin's bells fall silent as churches in Harlem face difficult
"Historically, the elderly people I talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner", said Mr. Adams.
"Today both are missing."
He said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"Today, people socialize in other ways", he says.
"Barets are no longer meeting points of the neighborhood, where people go regularly."
As far as churches are concerned, he expresses concern that money from selling property will not last as long as leaders claim "and sooner or later they will return to the starting point."
He added that the churches could be replaced by residential palaces full of people such as would not support the holy sites that have remained in the neighbourhood.
"Most of the people who buy housing facilities in these palaces are white", he said, "so very soon the day will come when these churches will be shut down permanently, as it's too short for most people who settle in these dwellings to become members of these churches."
Both churches are built by white congregations before Harlem was converted into a metropolitan of the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original congregation of white Methodists was transferred in the 1930s.
The building was occupied by a congregation of colored people who had had their place of worship nearby.
St. Martin passed a congregation of colored people under the direction of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of minority merchants on "125th Street", a main store street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote colored people.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged by a fire, but after Father Johnson's parishes made plans for reconstruction, they ordered the Crecon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called him "the burden of poor people."
The expert who played in the crore in July called it something quite different: "A cultural treasure" and a "unreplaceable historical institution."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also said that this was the first cacre in the world to be played by a colored musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to a larger Cable in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin had not replaced him.
The events of recent months in St Martin have been a complex story of architects and contractors, some sent by secular church leaders and others by episcopal diocese.
The council - the parish's governing body, composed of secular leaders - has written to the diocese in July, with concern that it "would attempt to transfer costs" to the parish council, despite the latter being not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishes complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark wounds 13-year-old during a dive to catch crabs in California
A shark has attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy Saturday as he was diving to catch crabs in California, on the opening day of the crab season, officials say.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m., near Beachon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel has voiced for KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with some friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, when he had heard the boy screaming for help, and then driving towards him along with a group to take him out of the water.
Hammel said that he had initially thought that the boy was simply thrilled by the grab of a crab, but then "I realized that he was yelling "He bit me!
It bit me!"
Hammel says that when he arrived at the boy, he saw that his entire clause was torn.
"I screamed all of them out of the water: '"There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the "Rady's" Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he has been declared in critical condition.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Coast Guard captain Larry Giles said in a news conference for the media that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks ago, but was designated as a safe shark species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the body.
Officials banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ekinitas for 48 hours, for investigative and security purposes.
Giles said that there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans entry into UK cosmetic market
Sainsbury's is competing Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with large store-style cosmetic wards, with a staff of specialized vendors.
Under a significant attempt to enter the UK cosmetic market of Â£2.8 billion, which is continuing to increase as sales of fashion clothing and household furniture declines, larger cosmetic wards will be tested in 11 stores around the country and spread to more stores next year if they result in success.
Investment in cosmetics comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to fill shelf spaces that were once used for televisions, microwaves, and household furnishings.
Sainsbury's has expressed that it would double its supply of cosmetic products up to 3000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Even existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be given more space, with areas dedicated to respective brands, similar to those located in stores like Boots.
The supermarket will also market its cosmetic line again Boutique, so that most products are of vegan composition - something increasingly required by newer-age buyers.
In addition, the retail perfumer "Fragrance Shop" will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, south of London, while a second one is expected to open later this year in Sally Oak, Birmingham.
Online acquisitions and a tendency toward daily acquisition of small quantities of food in neighborhood stores mean that supermarkets now have to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, has indicated that the outlets will begin to look more and more like large stores, while the supermarket chain tries to combat the discounts of Aldi and Lidl's prices with more services and nonfood products.
Sainsbury's has placed outlets "Argos" in hundreds of stores and has introduced a set of "Habitats" that after purchasing both networks two years ago, which according to him has promoted food products sales and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to restructure its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments resulted in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a union of societies with Boots in the early 2000s, but the union was dissolved after a debate on the way to separate revenue from pharmacies into his supermarkets.
The new strategy comes three years after Sainsbury's sold his pharmaceutical business to 281 Celesio stores, owners of the pharmaceutical network "Lloyds", for 125 million.
He said that "Lloyds" would play a role in the plan, adding an extended range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial leader of Sainsbury's, said, "We have transformed the appearance of our cosmetic wards to improve the environment in favor of our clients.
We have also invested in a staff with specialized formation, which will be willing to give advice.
The range of our brands has been conceived in such a way as to suit any need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations indicate that we are now an attractive cosmetic destination, which makes a distinction from the old way of making purchases."
Peter Jones "infuriated" as Holly Willoughby withdraws from the $11 million deal
"Dragons Den star", Peter Jones, has left "infuriated" after television presenter Holly Willoughby has been drawn by an eleven million-pound deal with his business dedicated to a certain lifestyle, to focus on her new contracts with "Marks and Spencer" and "IV"
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home furniture brand and "Truly" accessors.
The business of these two had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's "Goop" brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of "This Morning" addressed the Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has angered the star of "Dragons Den", Peter Jones, after the last moment withdrawal from their lucrative business dedicated to a certain lifestyle - to focus on her promising new contracts with "Marks & Spencer" and "ITV".
Sources say Jones was "infuriated" when the television's golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements - worth up to Â£1.5 million - meant that she no longer had enough time to devote to their home furniture brand and "Truly" accessors.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's "Goop" brand and was projected to double its estimated fortune in value of Â£11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, addressed the Instagram to announce her departure from "Truly", Jones has flown out of Britain towards one of his rest homes.
A source has been expressed: "Truly was undoubtedly at the top of Holly's priorities.
She would be her long-term future to accompany her over the next decades.
Her decision to retire left all persons involved absolutely stunned.
No one could believe what was happening Thursday, it was so close to the opening.
At the offices in Marlow is a warehouse full of goods that are ready to be sold."
Experts think that the departure of the presenter of "This Morning", which is among the most successful British stars, can cost the firm millions, due to considerable investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household furnishings, and cause further delays in its opening.
And that could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as its director in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones has 40 per cent stake in Baldwin's television production firm.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of "I'm A Celebrity" a ITV.
Last evening, a source near Jones has voiced "We don't want to comment on his business issues."
Harsh Conversations "and then we fell in love"
He made a joke about the criticisms he would receive from the news media due to a comment from him, which some would describe as "not worthy of a president", and because of the positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump surrendered so much?
Said Trump mockingly mimicking the voice of news announcers.
"I didn't give up at all".
He said Kim is interested in a second meeting, as their first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step towards denulearizing North Korea.
But negotiations on nonlearisation have been discontinued.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's leading diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, has addressed the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, saying the North sees no "contemptive response" from the U.S. to the first steps taken by North Korea for nonletularization.
On the contrary, he says, the U.S. is continuing sanctions aimed at under pressure.
Trump held a much more optimistic view in his mything speech.
"Things are getting better with North Korea," he has said.
"We were entering the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have an excellent relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive resultsâcutting missile testing, helping to release hostages, and bringing home the remainder of the American military.
In his speech regarding relations with Kim, he defended his unusual approach.
"It's very simple to behave as President, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing towards the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, killing hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, nonprofit foreign organizations were told that their presence was not necessary.
Despite the shift of more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population, no national catastrophe was declared, which constitutes a preliminary condition for the catalization of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have in many cases made it clear that they do not seek international support, so the issue is a little challenging," said Mrs. Sumung.
While "Save the Children" is setting up a team to travel towards Palu, it is still not known for sure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were praising the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Given Indonesiaâs frequent swings of land, the country remains extremely unprepared in the face of the anger of nature.
While shelters against the tsunami have been built in Aceh, they are hardly encountered in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of a siren for the tsunami warning in Palu, despite a warning being issued, is likely to have contributed to the loss of lives.
Even under the best conditions, travel between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is travelling towards Palu, but it will take her at least three days to reach the new disaster area.
President Joko Widdo used the improvement of Indonesia's lame infrastructure as the focal point of his election campaign, and has invested generous amounts of money for roads and railways.
But funding shortages have upset Mr. Yoko's administration, while it is located in the face of new elections to be held next year.
Mr. Yoko is also facing pressures from continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim community have embraced a more conservative form of trust.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have moved from their homes after the collision of Christian and Muslim groups on the street, where inns, bows and arrows were used, and other cold weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturgege scores an equal goal against Chelsea in the last minutes
Daniel Sturridge has saved Liverpool from a loss to Premier League vs Chelsea, with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturidge received a follow-up from Gerdan Shaqiri as it was located about 30 yards away from Chelsea's gate, while his team was losing by a score of 1-0.
He pushed the ball lightly to his left before making a hit towards the remote gate.
The ball flew over the area until it diverted toward the top and right corner of the net.
The ball escaped the air dance of Cape Arrizabalaga and ended up in the net.
"The aim was to settle in the proper position properly to get the ball and players like Shaq always play balls forward, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge said of LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I checked the ball with one touch and I didn't think too long but I just hit."
Chelsea led with a score of 1-0 in the first half, after a goal in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker made a rerun to Mateo Kovacic during that game, before rolling near the field and running with sprints towards Liverpool's semifield.
Kovacic made a fast combination in the midfield.
He then gave a beautiful vertical pass that brought Hazard into the area.
Hazard passed the defense in the speed duel and with a left-hand kick scored on the second pole, passing the ball behind Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker's wing.
Liverpool will face Naples in the Champions League phase, Wednesday at 3 pm, at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Tsunami death to Indonesia totals 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, the national disaster agency has expressed in the early hours of Sunday.
According to reports, many have remained trapped under the rubble of buildings demolished by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck Friday and caused waves up to 20 feet high, said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo at a press conference.
The town of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000 people, is crouched under the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman finds her death from stab wound
An investigation into murder has been announced after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews at John Street, while a 32-year-old man has been arrested as a suspect in the murder.
Police have called on local residents who have seen or heard anything to report for evidence.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I would like to call on any person who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead, who may have seen or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
Also, I want to call everyone, especially the taxi drivers, who may have caught film footage, to contact us as they can have information of essential importance for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the victim is a resident of Birkenhead and its body has been found inside a settlement.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman have come to the stage to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, while police have said they are notifying the victim's family.
A resident taxi driver in Grayson Mews has attempted to enter his apartment, but has been informed by police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was left speechless when he discovered the event.
Now residents are being announced that they will only be allowed to enter their homes in a few hours.
A police officer has been heard telling a man that the entire area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman has reached the crime scene in tears.
She repeats over and over again the words "this is terrible".
At 2: 00 p.m., two police vans were within the perimeter, and another van was outside.
A number of officers were positioned within the perimeter, monitoring the housing block.
Each person with information is praying to send a direct message to @MerpolCC, call 101 or contact "Crimestoppers" anonymously at number 0800 555 111 by selecting code 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament, the most recent monument affected by the debate on "rescription of history"
Its removal would be a merited punishment for the Taliban destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts on the part of its Puritan fanatic followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "the Marre" and "attempt to rewrite the story".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "Between the current debate over the removal of statues, the aim of Oliver Cromwell's image was imminent outside Westminster's Palace.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps this would be a sacrifice of Cromwell wrong for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the past century.
The excellent portretization of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the history of a figure for which many think they still deserve to be praised.
Mr Goldsmith said of "The Sunday Telegraph": "Many people, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, saw Cromwell as a defender of parliament from external pressure, which, of course, in his case, was the monarchy.
The fact that this is a fully accurate portrayal is the subject of ongoing historical debates.
What is certain is that the mid-19th century conflict shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual figure known which represents a side of that medal.
His achievements as Lord Protctor also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
Killer pig wounds Chinese farmer to death
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, only identified with his surname "Yuan", has been found lifeless with a fractured artery and covered in blood near a pig stud in the Liupanshiu market in Guizhou Province, reported "South China Morning Post" on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pig vaccines into a stable on May 30, 2005, in Xinghai Province, China.
Reportedly he had traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday, to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin has found him lifeless and has discovered the door of a nearby open pigsty.
He has said that there was a large male pig in the stable with a bloody mouth.
A forensic examination has confirmed that the 550-pound pig has injured the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and crippled", his cousin identified with the surname "Wu," as quoted in the evening news in Guiyang.
In footage filmed by the security camera, Yuan has been seen entering the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager has confessed to the evening news that the pig was held in isolation to prevent any other attack, while police collected evidence at the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of swine - attacked people have previously been marked.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing the husband severe wounds.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig grabbed a Welsh farmer behind his tractor, until his wife drove the animal out.
After a farmer from Oregon was bitten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said to CBC News that usually, pigs are not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as "insults".
"They just want to play.
They're like curious little ones... their purpose is not to hurt you.
You just have to show them the proper respect," he said.
The aftermath of Hurricane Rosa is expected to bring large, wide rainfall to the U.S. Southwest
As predicted, the power of Hurricane Rosa is being softened as it moves toward the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, over the following days, Rosa will cause flooding in northern Mexico and in the southwestern U.S.
On Sunday, at 5 a.m. with the east clock, Rosa was escorted at speeds 85 miles per hour, classifying as a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean a low atmospheric pressure zone is beginning to form, which is moving toward the East, towards the U.S. West Coast.As Rosa is expected to approach the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, she will continue to push great tropical humidity toward the north of it, in the direction of the southwestern U.S.
On Monday, Rosa will cause 10-inch precipitation in parts of Mexico.
Subsequently, the interaction of tropical moisture with the low atmospheric pressure zone will cause over the following days heavy rainfalls of extensive southwest.
At local level, rainfalls at 1 to 4 inches high will cause immediate flooding, waste leaks and possible landslides of land in the desert.
The high tropical neighborhood will cause precipitation rates in certain areas to reach approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in some parts of Nevada and southern Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of precipitation is predicted in some areas of the Southwest, mainly over a large part of Arizona.
There is also the possibility of immediate flooding with rapid deterioration of conditions because of the disseminated nature of tropical precipitation.
Because of the danger of tropical precipitation, it is not recommended to walk through the desert.
The heavy rainfall can turn the canyons into mighty rivers, and the storms will bring strong winds and dust storms into the area.
Approaching the low-pressure atmospheric area will bring heavy rainfall to parts of California's southern coast.
Total rainfall levels can reach over half an inch, which can cause small waste leaks and slippery roads.
For the region, these will be the first precipitation of the rainy season.
Several scattered tropical rainfalls will begin approaching Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, before rainfalls extend wider Monday and Tuesday evening.
Strongfalls will be distributed on all four sides Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October in the U.S. may be marked by high temperature swings, with temperatures dropping in the Arctic, while the tropics remain warm.
At times, this leads to drastic changes in temperatures over short distances.
A good example is the drastic temperature difference across the central U.S. on Sunday.
Between the city of Kansas in Missouri and Omahas in Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, the temperature difference is about 20 degrees.
During the following days, the remaining summer heat will try to accumulate and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to start October with warm temperatures, at the average of 80, from the South Fields to certain parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which temperature would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows high chances for temperatures above average in the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have attended Brett Kavanaugh's court hearing
Over 20 million people have followed through six television networks the interesting testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanough and of the woman who has accused him of a sexual assault allegedly occurring in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political blockade continued, and broadcasters discontinued regular programs to broadcast the turnaround in the last minute of Friday's events: a deal reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for conducting a week-long investigation by the FBI on the charges.
Ford said in front of the Senate Judicial Committee that it is 100 per cent sure that Kavanaugh had touched him while he was drunk and had tried to strip him off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a fiery testimony, said it was 100 per cent certain that this had not happened.
The number of followers is likely to have been higher than that of 20.4 million people, reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company was measuring average ratings in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News channel and MSNBC.
Figures for other broadcast networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting viewers from offices.
To put this figure in perspective, the size of this audience is similar to that of a football elimination or that of Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionists have strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led other networks with an average of 5,69 million viewers during the 24-hour session, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second place with 3,26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest continued to remain high even after the end of the court hearing.
Flame was the main character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he faced the outcry of the protesters while trying to get to the elevator to go to the Judicial Committee's court hearing.
In CNN's live broadcast, he appeared standing eyes down for a few minutes while being reprimanded.
"I'm standing here, right in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have the power, while there are so many weak women."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he said there would be more to say during the committee session.
Several hours later, all cable and satellite networks were covering directly the moment when the Judicial Committee would vote for the passage of Kavanaugh's candidacy for voting before all members of the Senate.
But Flake said that he would only do so in the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate over the following week, as the Democratic minority had requested.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and with several other senators after him, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice was clever, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without conducting the investigation.
President Trump has requested the opening of an investigation by the FBI on charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing political games" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and compromising national interest, in an interview for the "Sunday Times" newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview adjacent to her on the front page of the paper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued the attack on her plan for Brexit, the so-called "Cravers", indicating that the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect taxes on each other's account is "totally absurd."
Wayde Sims' gun murder: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the killing of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player of the LSU team.
20-year-old Dytheon Simpson has been arrested and questioned in prison facilities under the charge of unintentioned murder, Baton Rouge Police Directorate has been expressed.
Official sources have released the confrontation video between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims had lost his glasses during the clash.
Police have found glasses at the scene and say they have found traces of Simpson's DNA on them, reports the WAFB subsidiary of CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, police said he has admitted to firing a gun on Wayde causing his death.
The amount for his release has been set at the price of $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The Office of the East Baton Rouge Legal Doctor has issued a preliminary report Friday, where it states that the cause of death has been a gunshot wound from head to neck.
The department thanks the tax force of the fugitives near Louisiana State Police, the state police criminalry laboratory, Southern University police and the citizens of the area, for helping with the investigations leading to the author's arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva has thanked the legal authorities of the area for "their appeal and for bringing justice into the country."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-inch boy was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, had also played basketball for LSU.
In the last season, he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 tackles per each game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball team coach, Will Wade, said the team was "grieved" and "astounded" by the death of Wayde.
"That's what we're worried about all the time," Wade said.
Volcano casts grace on Mexico City
The ash from the Popcatepetl volcano has reached as far as the southern neighbourhoods of the capital city of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater was reawakened and 183 gas and ash concessions were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre had monitored a series of thunders and swings.
Images on social media showed thin ash sheets covering car windows in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochymilco.
Geophysicists have confirmed an increase in volcano activity, located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people have been arrested in Barcelona on Saturday following the clash of pro-independence protesters with peacekeeping police forces, while thousands of people have joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalana's polarisation vote for secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists, surrounded by peacekeeping police forces, struck with eggs and powder paint creating dark clouds of dust across streets usually swarming with tourists.
Later in the day there were fights as police had to use rubber sticks to end the collisions.
For several hours in a row, repeating the slogan "We Don't Forget, We Don't Forgive", pro-independence groups faced unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen persons were treated for minor injuries received during the protests, according to local press reports.
In the region where pro-independence feelings prevail, tensions continue to remain high even a year after the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite the turnout being low, as citizens against the secession boycotted the polls.
According to Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people remained injured last year as police attempted to stop the polls at polling stations in the region through violent collisions.
Friday evening, pro-independence groups set up camps abroad to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take another turn.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the separatist protest together with his wife, said there was no longer any hope that Catalana would gain independence in the future.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry for joy that they would have the opportunity to vote, but now we are stuck", he said.
Despite having achieved a vital victory in the last December local elections, although with close results, the pro-independence Catalan parties have found it difficult to maintain the momentum this year, as many of their most recognized leaders have either voluntarily left the country or are in custody and awaiting judgment for their role in organising the referendum and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who was recording the protest on his phone to help the police, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians of both directions.
"The situation is getting more and more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who are in prison awaiting trial since the end of last year, stated it would run in elections for the European Parliament next year.
"Pending candidacy for European elections is the best way to oppose the regression of democratic values and the suppression that has been made to us by the Spanish government", he said.
Londonerry: Several people arrested after the car crashes into the house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car has crashed several times with a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, at around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said that injuries have been caused at the main gate and in the apartment itself.
It is thought that at some given moment an arrow was thrown in the direction of the car.
Menga's strike gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston provided victory
The team coming from a category below, Livingston surprised Rangers causing Steven Gerard's second defeat in 18 games as team coach from Ibrox.
The strike of Dolly Menga resulted in decisive results as Gary Holt's team matched the second-place Hibernian touchdown.
Gerard's team has not yet won an off-field meeting in Premiership, this season and next Sunday, will face Hearts, the difference with which is eight points.
But first, Rangers will wait at home Rapid Vienna, in the match valid for the League of Europe, on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended the successive win series to six meetings, and coach Holt has not yet experienced defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses instances in the face of consistent opponents
Holt's team should have switched to advantage many minutes before scoring, as their direct attacks caused the Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but hit poorly at the gate, while then Alan Lithgow hit off in the slide after having given the head pass by Craig Halkett.
The locals were willing to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause problems in the standard shocks.
And so it was scored the goal that set the meeting.
Rangers caused a penalty kick and Livingston created space.Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined by creating the Menga opportunity, which struck and scored in the centre of the area.
By that moment, the Rangers had dominated the hold of the ball but the local defense had resulted in in in inaccessible, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had almost never been put to the test,
This kind of game continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a reception.
Scott Pittman's hit stopped by the goalkeeper of Rangers Allan McGregor while Lithgow hit off by another standard hit of Livingston.
The bows consistently came to the Livingston area and were continually cleared, while the two claims of penalty - following Halket's interference with the coming player as substitute Glenn Middleton, and another for hand-to-hand touch - were not taken into consideration.
Livingston's 'Fenomenal' Game - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and phenomenal result for Livingston.
For a man, they played brilliantly and continued to exceed expectations in this breeding trajectory.
The style of the game and their team have not changed much since their return to the top, but a major credit lies with Holt for the way he electrified the team since he arrived.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was exceptional, leading a perfectly organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in difficulty throughout the match.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although in some cases they played very well under Gerard's direction, they lacked quality.
Mungoi's final follow-up - only once managed to pass opposing defense - and that's something that should serve as an alarm for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan expected with mixed feelings in Cologne
Saturday (29 September) was characterized by blue skies smiles as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which was aimed at regulating relations between NATO allies.
They have declined in opposition to issues such as human rights, media freedom, and Turkey's EU membership.
Subsequently, Erdogan headed for Kolonje to open a new giant mosque.
The city houses the largest number of Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, police stopped gathering a crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but however many supporters took to the surrounding streets to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom were Kurds - also raised their voice to condemn both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Opposing protests reflect the divisive ability of a visitor worshipped as a hero by some of Germany's Turks and despised as autocrats by some others.
Road accident at Deptford: The cyclist dies after collision with the car
A cyclist has found death after having crashed into a London car.
The accident has occurred near the intersection of Bestwoord Street with Evelyn Street, a busy traffic route in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 p.m.
The car driver stopped and rescue workers came immediately, but the victim passed away at the scene.
The crash occurred several months after another cyclist lost his life in an accident where the author left the scene, which occurred at Childers Street, about a mile from the Saturday crash site.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the person and alert his family.
Roads have been closed and buses have been reported to use other routes, while vehicle executives have been advised to avoid the area.
Long High Prison: Six Officers Hurt During a Rebellion
Six prison officers have remained injured during a riot in a men's high-security prison, the Prison Office has been voiced.
Rebellion broke out in HMP Long High in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday, and still continues.
The "Tornado" specialists officers have been called upon to keep the riots under control, where eight prisoners are involved and which are confined within one wing of the prison.
Officers have received treatment on the scene for several minor facial wounds.
A Prison Service spokesman said, "The prison personnel with specialized training has been mobilized to keep control of the incident currently occurring in HMP Long High.
Six staff members have received treatment for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and have made it clear that the responsible persons will refer to the police and may receive extensions of the prison sentence".
HMP Long Martin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had underwent hospital treatment after an attack by one of the prisoners.
And in October of last year, officers of the peacekeeping police force were called to prison to keep a serious situation under control, where personnel were attacked with billiardoy cannons.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with immediate flooding (which may make an advantage of drought areas)
Although a tropical depression rarely strikes Arizona, this is most likely exactly what will happen the first few days of the next week as the remaining power of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwest Desert, spreading danger of immediate flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued warnings of immediate flooding for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the lead in Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday's rainy hour.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix was expressed in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have received storm status or tropical depression in a 200-mile radius from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Urangan Center predict 2 to 4 inches of precipitation, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches at the Mogolon border of Arizona.
In other areas of the desert in the Southwest, including central Rockies and Grand Basen, precipitation is expected to be at level 1 to 2 inches, while in isolated areas their total can reach 4 inches.
For areas outside the risk of immediate flooding, Rosa's precipitation may be a blessing, as the region has been hit by drought.
Although floods are a serious concern, some of these precipitation may be beneficial, as Southwest is currently facing drought conditions.
According to the American Center for the Monitoring of the Dryer, a little over 40 per cent of Arizona is facing extreme droughts of the second category", wether.com reported.
Originally, Hurricane Rosa will hit Mexico's Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, still with hurricane power on Sunday morning, with winds at maximum speed 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is facing cold waters over the Pacific, resulting in loss of power.
Consequently, the hurricane is expected to strike Mexico with tropical storm power in the afternoon or Monday evening.
Rainfalls over some areas of Mexico may be strong, presenting considerable risk to flooding.
"A rainfall of an average level of 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to northwestern Sonorare, and can reach 10 inches", reported Weather.com.
The Rosa will then move north through Mexico, in the form of a tropical storm, before reaching the border with Arizona in Tuesday's early morning hours as tropical depression, which will then move through Arizona, reaching southern Utah on Tuesday evening.
"The main risk expected from Rosa or from its aftermath are heavy precipitation in Baja California, in northwestern Sonorare and in the southwestern U.S. desert", said the National Urangan Center.
These precipitation are expected to cause immediate life-threatening flooding, waste leaks in the desert, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
The attack on Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for remaining attempted murder
Three teenage sons and a 20-year-old man have been arrested as suspects for remaining murder in the attempt, following the injury of a 16-year-old knife in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, about 04:00 BST of the Saturday day.
He was escorted to hospital, where he is currently in "stable" condition.
According to Avon police and Somerset, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officers have called for appearances to anyone who may have picked up film footage by cell phone from the event.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has faced the ill and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and cruel tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling in western Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "has faced the humiliation and anger" of the Democratic Party during his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying with conviction and thrill Christine Blasey Ford's charge that he had assaulted him sexually decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Even Ford gave a testimony during the hearing regarding her charge.
On Saturday, the President said that that day "American people witnessed the greatness, qualities of character and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote in support of Judge Kavanaugh's appointment is a vote for one of the most clever lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a clear public service record," he said in front of the crowd of supporters in western Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's appointment during the speech on the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term election.
"Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I will not run, but I am contributing," he said.
"That's why I'm making so much effort and fighting for excellent candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are missioned to make "resistance of blockade".
The first main procedural vote by the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later than on Friday, the deputy of a senior GOP leader has told CNN
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, while figures are expected to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were engulfed by huge waves that crashed on beaches, when the island of Sulawes of Indonesia was struck by an earthquake and tsunami, authorities indicated on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when the high waves up to six metres (18 feet) crashed ashore at dusk, swallowing and causing the death of many and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"The day yesterday, when the tsunami threat arose, people were still carrying out their usual activities on the beach, and consequently did not run immediately and fell victim to it", said at a Sutopo Purwo Nugroho press conference, spokesperson for Indonesian disaster prevention agency.
"The tsunami did not come alone, he took with him cars, logs, houses, hit everything on the ground", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea with a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles per hour), before hitting the coastline.
Several persons climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Peru.
The air photos released by the disaster agency featured a series of demolished buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges, and a water - surrounded mosque.
The aftershocks continued to rock the coastal town on Saturday.
The earthquake line was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy generated by Friday's massive earthquake was about triple the power of the atomic bomb dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The town's geographical position, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have multiplied the tsunami's power, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "great conditions" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
Several corpses were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been left injured and 29 had disappeared.
Nugroho said the number of victims and damage rates may be much larger along the 300 km coastline (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the quake epicenter.
The communication networks "were completely discontinued without any warning" by Donggala, Nugroho said.
That area has over 300,000 inhabitants", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were travelling towards affected areas.
"This has already turned into a tragedy, but the situation could worsen as well", he said.
On Saturday, the agency was sharply criticised after failing to give notice of Palu's tsunami hit, despite officials saying that the waves had come at the time of the warning being issued.
In amateur footage distributed in social media, a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard warning passers-by on the way down for the tsunami's arrival with furious screams.
Within minutes, a wave crashes ashore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters failed to verify the veracity of the footage immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage, which cut off communications across Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending cargo aircraft with aid from Yakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated persons continue to have great needs for food and other basic needs.
The city's airport has only been reopened for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widdo was expected to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of casualties from the tsunami in Indonesia totals over 800.
The situation is quite serious.
While World Vision staff from Donggala has arrived without problems in the town of Palu, where employees are being housed in tarpoline shelters (dated favorites) in their office yard, they witnessed scenes of destruction along the way, said Mr Doseba.
"They confessed to me that they had seen many destroyed houses", he said.
The situation is quite serious.
Although relief groups began serious efforts to set in motion humanitarian aid mechanisms, some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were being prohibited from travelling towards Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies, and external staff may begin to circulate only if the disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at regional level", said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government says "O.K., this is a national catastrophe", we may seek national aid, but this status has not yet been granted".
The second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and families of missing persons still had hope that the case of their loved ones would be by the few miracles that ever occur in the event of natural disasters.
On the Sabbath day, a little boy was taken out of a well.
On Saturday, rescue forces released a woman who had been left under the rubble for two days, with her mother's corpse standing next to her.
Gendon Subandino, coach of the Indonesian national parachutism team, had trained two of the missing paratroopers for the Asian Games, which were closed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several others of the people trapped in the "Roa Roa" hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As an old professional in the field of parachutism, I am very emotionally charged", he said.
Mr Gendon reminisces how in the hours following the circulation of news of the collapse of the "Roa Roa" hotel among the parachutism community, he had tried desperately to write to the WhatsApp competitors from Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, ended only with a sign of gray scaling, instead of two blue-colored signs.
"I think this means that the messages were not sent", he said.
Thieves steal $26,75$ during recharge of an ATM at Newport in Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police Directorate on Friday morning, several thieves have stolen $26,75$ from an employee of Brink, who was refilling an ATM in Levee's Newport.
The driver of the vehicle had been emptying an ATM at a entertainment center and was trying to distribute other money, Detective Dennis wrote in the statement.
While he was busy, someone "came running from behind the Brink employees" and stole a bag of money destined for surrender.
According to the statement, witnesses had seen several suspects leaving the location, but police have not specified the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes the name to Ye
The Kanye West rapper will change his name to Ye.
Declared the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Chiefly known as Kanye West".
41-year-old West has long been called Ye, and has used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released on the market in June.
The change has come shortly before his release in Saturn Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace singer Ariana Grande in the show, which cannot come for "emotional reasons", said the show's creator.
In addition to being abbreviated of his current art name, West has expressed in the past that the word has a religious significance for it.
"I think "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you'", it has said West earlier this year, talking about his album title with Big Boy radio presenter.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
I went from Kanye, which means "the only one," simply "Ye", which is the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, of everything.
The album is rather a reflection of what we are".
He is one of many famous rapers who have changed their name.
Sean Comms is otherwise known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he stated that he preferred the name Love and Brother Love.
A former West Fellow, JAY-Z, has done as he has done with or without a dividing visa and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use the army against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has pledged that he will never use military force against civilians, as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody representation against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador vowed that "it will never use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
On 2 October 1968, the army troops opened fire on peaceful demonstrators in the square, killing a total of 300 people, at a time when the students' left movements were rising up throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youths by giving students monthly subsidies and by opening more public universities free of charge.
He has stated that unemployment and lack of education opportunities push young people towards criminal gangs.
The U.S. must double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. must double the amount spent for research in this area, the investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, says.
Comments have come as various parts of the U.S. government have announced artificial intelligence revelations, despite the U.S. lacking an overall official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China has announced its plan last year: within 2030, it aims to take the first place for innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.
"Double budgets for research in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, since other countries are still very behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next great discovery in this field," Lee said.
Double funding may double chances that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence will take place in the US, Lee said in an interview for CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book titled "Super Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", which was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is executive director of Venture Synovation, which has invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the "Carnegie Mellon" University, he created an artificial intelligence system that also surpassed the leading American player in Othelo, and then worked as executive director near Microsoft Research and as president of the Google branch in China.
Lee praised the previous U.S. government competitions for technology, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Agency for Advanced Projects in the Defense Field, and asked when the next contest would take place, in order to help identify the new visionarys.
Lee said that often, researchers in the U.S. have to work hard to get grants from the government.
"It's not China that is driving academic leaders away; it's corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed brilliant minds from universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. promote its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think the green cards should be automatically given to persons with the title doctor in the field of artificial intelligence", he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China issued the New Intelligence Management Plan.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China offers financing for persons in academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money for American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Early this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Center of Artificial Intelligence, which is expected to include partners from industry and academy, and the White House announced the establishment of the Selective Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
Meanwhile, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called "AI Next".
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in research into the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, American legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not found implementation for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to decide whether its name will be changed to "Republical of North Macedonia", a movement which could resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked its efforts for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, thinks its northern neighbour's name constitutes a claim on its territory, and has vetoed its NATO and EU membership.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change could compromise the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic of Macedonia's population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has indicated that he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether voter turnout will reach the 50 per cent needed for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum ballot sheet reads: "Are you for NATO and EU membership through acceptance of agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, as one of the countries created by the dissolution of Yugoslavia, this is a price worth paying to achieve membership in structures such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, as this implies a safer life for all of us", 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska said in Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding powers, a sufficient number of MPs have indicated they will abide by the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities had been reported until 1 pm.
However, voter turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections of 2016, where 66 per cent of registered voters cast their vote.
"I came to vote for the sake of my children, we have the country in Europe", said Jose Tanevski, 62, voters in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their vote in the referendum on changing the name of Macedonia, which would pave the way for the country's membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a minor scene and was placing chairs in front of tents set up by referendum boycotters.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the head up, not by entering the back door", Kavadarkov said.
"Our country is poor, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us by the name of Macedonia, we can address other states such as China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much needed investment for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be the pro, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens are pro-EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive result would "confirm our future".
According to a survey published last Monday by the Institute of Macedonia for Political Research, about 30 per cent to 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum - a figure below the necessary level of turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian television Telma found that 57 per cent of the participants planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent indicated they would vote in pros.
For a successful referendum, the turnout rate should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would give the first strong hit to the pro-Western government's policy, since it came to power in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes through all Brighton defenses to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling braved all of Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday, at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his goal in the 65th minute look extremely light.
The Argentine shooter received a pass in the midfield at the start of the action.
He waded through Brighton's three defenders, before going out on the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He crossed a defender and spent in speedings several others at the entrance to the Brighton area.
He then followed to the left where Sterling was located.
The English striker exploited his exit into the area to follow the ball to Agueros, who struck with the right and crossed goalkeeper Mathew Ryan by throwing the ball to the right corner of the net.
"Aguero is suffering from a foot problem", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We discussed that he would play about 55 or 60 minutes.
Here's what happened.
We were lucky he scored goal at the moment".
But it was Sterling who gave the blues the initial advantage in the Premier League match.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute.
During that action, Aguero took the ball into Brighton's halffield.
He verticalized beautifully for Laroy Sane on the left flank.
Sane advanced several steps before following towards Sterling on the second pillar.
The blue striker led the ball to the net and then slipped off the boundary lines.
City will face Hophenheim at the valid challenge for the Champions League group phase, Thursday at 12:55 p.m. in Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to preserve the role of "puncher" against Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the chance to reach the eliminationists, there was no reason to impose another start.
But Scherzer, who is always competitive, hopes to be given the opportunity to score against Colorado Rockies, but only if playoff's opportunity exists for Rockys, who have an advantage with one match to Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West.
Rockies achieved at least one opportunity for playoff thanks to the 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still trying to get the division title.
"Even though we are playing without any motive, we can at least sign by recognising the fan atmosphere here in Denver but the fact that the opposing team will play at the highest level against which we can face throughout the year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in such a challenge?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be headlined on Sunday, but are reportedly keen to let Scherzer start the meeting in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th appearance as a titler, conducted a training session on Thursday and could be presented on the field on Sunday, which could be a normal day off day for him.
The player from Washington, who shoots right is 18-7 with an ERA 2,53 ERA and 300 "stricouts" in 220 2/3 of the shots this season.
Trump collects western Virginia in rallying
The president referred indirectly to the situation regarding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanough, before speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"The November is crucial for everything we have done so far.
Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the biggest elections -- I'm not running, but I'm contributing, and that's why I'm trying so hard to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on, "You see this awful group of radical Democrats, you see what's happening at this moment.
And they've made up their minds to regain power in any way, you see their shame and filth.
They don't care who they hurt, who they press with their feet to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, but we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, are missioned to make "resistance of blockade".
"And you've seen this during the last days", he said, calling the Democrats "wrath, cruel, filthy and treacherous".
He referred by name to the Democratic Chiefs of the Senate Judicial Committee, Diane Feinstein, which sparked chants of discontent from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you spread the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I... wait... her body language was bad enoughâit was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer an "open church".
She's non-tolerant to those who say what they think
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for the no-confidence motion against me, I was not so surprised.
After all, I am not the first of the Labour Party deputies to be told that they are not welcomed - all because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was similarly treated simply because he firmly opposed antisemitism.
In my case, the no-confidence motion was a criticism of me for failing to agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
In terms of the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security and Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy contradicted the former leaders.
In announcement of the Labour Party meeting at Nottingham East, it was said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight-year period as a local Labour Party MP, GC meetings have been just like that.
Unfortunately, the meetings no longer have their previous tone, and the promise of a "soft and gentler" policy has long been forgotten, if ever it existed.
It has become increasingly evident that opposing views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptance by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while colleagues with whom I thought that I shared similar political views began to pretend that I would take a 180 degree turn and maintain attitudes with which I would not have agreed in any way - whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Every time I speak in public - no matter what I say - the criticisms erupt in social media, with people demanding my dismissal, denounce the policies of the center, they tell me I should not be part of the Labour Party.
And that's not just me.
I am aware that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as comments about me tend to be of a political nature.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face gender and racial discrimination every day, but don't have to.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of levels of violence.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said the Labour Party should nurture a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an "open church", and with any motion of confidence and with any change of rules of selection, the party becomes increasingly closed.
Over the last two years, I have been frequently advised to lower my head, not to be so noisy, and so everything "will go well".
But that's not why I'm in politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, driven by the care of Thatcher's government leading to failure to my class in a general school, I have tried to lobby for better public services to those most in need - be it a member of a local council or as a minister of government.
I've never hidden my policy, even in the last election.
Everyone in Nottingham East had my political stances and the points of controversy with the current leadership.
For all who voted for the motion on Friday, I just want to say that the country is moving towards a Brexit that will affect our families, businesses and public services, and I cannot understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But indeed, the only message I want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum, but my voters, whether or not members of the Labour Party: I am proud to be in your service and I promise that no threat to dismissal or political favour will prevent me from acting in your best interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr tops the lists
The two delayed attempts may have changed the final score somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in Tenent's exceptionally fun game Premiership today.
Now they lead the lists as the only undefeated team among ten teams.
In the end, it was their miraculous defense and courage to take risks the one who provided the victory to the local team, and coach Peter Murchie had the full right to be satisfied.
"We've shown ourselves in every game, and we're still invincible, so normally I'm happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose put it this way: "We want to congratulate the Ayr team, who undertook more risks than we do".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, back to goal by Frazier Climo, passed Ayr to the advantage, but a yellow card for Scottish representative player Rory Hughes, coming for this challenge from Warriors, allowed Melrose to display numerical superiority, and Jason Baggott received an unexplored ball.
Climo increased Ayr's advantage with a penalty while shortly before the end of the first half, he scored and turned a single action into goal, bringing the score to 17-5 for Ayr before the break.
But Melrose started the second part well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, back in goal by Baggot, reduced the difference to five points.
Subsequently, there was a long break as a result of Ruardh Knott's heavy injury, which left with the stretcher, and after the game's restart, Ayr increased the score through an attempt by Staffford McDowall, marked by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, was subsequently punished with yellow card, and Melrose reused the fact that they had one more player, with an unbroken goal attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a rough-prime play.
However, the locals returned, and when Struan Hutchinson was punished with yellow card because it prevented Climo, no ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson made "touchdown", behind the back of Ayr's trio (moul) that was advancing forward.
Climo scored and did the same almost after the start of the game, as Kyle Rowe caught the ball hit by David Armstrong in the area and advanced the attack player (flanker) Gregor Henry, for the local team's fifth attempt.
"Styll Game" star appears set for new career in restaurant industry
"Styll Game" star Ford Kieran appears determined to enter the hotel industry after it was revealed that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the BBC's famous show, with co-sceptarian and co-protagonist his long-term partner in the comedy world, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last for this show, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craigang.
According to official records records data, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on history, although a source for Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan was trying to enter Glasgow's "fundaneous restaurant industry".
"The Sea Is Ours": Bolivia Without Outings at Sea Hopes the Court Makes Way for the Pacific
Sailors patrol a fleet headquarters improvisation in La Paz.
Public buildings have raised the blue ocean flag.
At sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazona has been marked the motto: "The Sea is our property.
His retaking is a duty."
Over Bolivia without outing at sea, the memory of taking the coast from Chile in a bloody conflict for resources during the 19th century is still quite aliveâas is the desire to once again sail across the Pacific Ocean.
Now, these hopes are more likely than they have ever been for decades, while on October 1, Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice ruling after a five-year review.
"Bolivia is characterized by momentum, spirit of unity and calm, and of course, is expecting the result with positive," said Roberto Calzadella, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will attend the GND hearing on large screens across the country, in the hope that The Hague's tribunal will decide in Bolivia's favor that - after decades of irregular discussions - Chile is forced to hold talks to give Bolivia a sovereign territory with outreach to the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president - who is in the face of a controversial battle for receiving the second term in next year's election - Monday's decision is very important.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he pledged in late August.
But some analysts agree that it is highly unlikely that the court will rule in Bolivia's favor - that even if, very little will change.
The UN body headquartered in the Netherlands has no tax to give another part of Chile's territory to another state, and has indicated it will not decide the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the end is coming up with a decision just six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the issue "was not complicated", said Paz ZÃ¡rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of helping the Bolivia cause, the events of the past four years may have penalized it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been compromised by the current Bolivian administration", ZÃ¡rate said.
Morale's aggressive rhetoric has eliminated any remnants of goodwill to Chileans, she suggested.
At a certain point, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo RodrÃ­guez VeltzÃ©, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, objected to the idea that the court's decision making was surprisingly rapid.
Monday will offer Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance "to end the 139-year-old disputes, with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - was using the maritime issue for political interests.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean" he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to understand that we should leave the past behind".
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not be carried out as long as it cannot trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation will by no means carry out the first disarmament from nuclear weapons, as long as it cannot trust Washington.
Ri was giving a speech on the Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during a summit in Singapore among leaders of rival states.
His comments come at a time when American Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of revival of nuclear diplomacy so far "sleepy", more than three months after Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
According to Ri, hopes that continuing sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will make North Korea kneel, are vain hopes.
As long as Pyongyang does not act first to make significant disarmament movements, Washington is reluctant to accept the statement.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang's intention to draw its arsenal, which the state most likely sees as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of giant hats, which will soon come to the streets of your city
If you want to enrich your collection of hats or provide complete protection from the sun, do not seek further.
Stilists Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of giant strange hats for their SS19 collection in the pasarela, which left all designers openly at Fashion Week in Paris.
Excessive unprincipled hats have spread to the Instagram this summer, and these stylists have put their startling creations into succession.
Valentino's special creation was an extremely extravagant beige hat, decorated with a wide shelter with featherlike details, which encircled the model's head.
Other major accessors included stone-enhanced watermelons, a magician hat and even a pineapple - but they are not made to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks - Just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had stitched lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than like haute couture.
One creation was similar to diving devices, complete with air ducts and water glasses, while another resembled a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you like to follow this bold fashion - you're lucky.
Fashion analysts predict that giant hats may soon come to the streets of your city.
The giant hat trend has followed that of "La Bomb", the straw hat with the two-foot-wide shelter, which we have all seen, ranging from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the extremely unpracticed hat that it received in social media produced another major creation in the pasarela - a straw beach bag, almost as large as the swimming - cloth model that was carrying it.
The bright orange rafia bag, decorated with rafia fringes and with a white leather handle on top, was the most special creation of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection in the Fashion Week in Paris.
The stylist of famous personalities Luke Armitage confessed to FEMAIL: "The next summer I predict to see hats and giant beach bags on the streets of towns - as the designer has left a impact so large that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large accessors".
John Edward: Basic linguistic skills for global citizens
Private schools in Scotland hold the record for academic excellence, and this has also continued in 2018 with another fine array of results in exams, further reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music, and other fields.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Private School Council (SCIS), try to provide the highest level of service for students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further education of higher levels, for their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can chart and implement a adapted educational curriculum, we are witnessing how the modern language branch continues to be a popular and popular choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela has said, "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, your words go to his ear.
If thou speakest unto him in his own tongue, it is in thine heart that thy words go out.
These words are a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone when we want to develop relationships with people from foreign lands.
From the results of this year's final exams, we can find that languages are leading the list of results, with the highest degree of passing grades among private schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who have studied foreign languages have received a maximum A grade.
The data collected by 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students had received maximum A grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying for German, 69 percent of those studying for French, and 63 percent of those studying for Spanish had also received grade A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as one of the vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed for children and young people in the future.
Currently, the foreign language branch is considered as important as the STEM branches (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in private school curriculums and beyond.
A 2014 study by the United Kingdom Commission on Employment and Skills found that among the main difficulties facing employers in filling vacant countries, 17 percent of them related to the lack of linguistic skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary for the preparation of young people for their future careers.
With the addition of jobs costing foreign language possession, these abilities are essential to a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have real advantages in the future, as possessors of such long-term ability.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign people will automatically position a multilingual person over competitors.
According to a survey of YouGov, which included over 4,000 adults from the UK in 2013, 75 percent of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to develop a conversation, and French was the only foreign language spoken by a percentage of 2 digits, namely 15 percent.
This is why investing in language learning is important to children today.
Possession of many languages, and especially the possession of languages of developing countries, will give children a better chance of employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages taught in them.
Some schools will focus on modern more classical languages, while others will offer languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom in the 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your childâs interest, there will always be a number of languages you can select in private schools, with professoric staff made up of field specialists.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing a school environment that will prepare children and "armato" those with the skills needed to succeed, however the future.
At these times it cannot be denied the fact that in a global business environment, languages continue to have a vital importance for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be regarded as "ability of international communication".
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and exclusiveness to the youth of Scotland.
Il faut falls leave faire.

LeBron expected to debut with Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans waiting to see LeBron James in his first game for Log Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach, Luke Walton, has announced that James will play in the pre-season opening game Sunday day against Denver Nuggets, in San Diego.
However, it is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"There will be more than 1 and less than 48", Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Lakers' correspondent wrote in Tweeter that, most likely, James will play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' six pre-season games program.
"I don't need matches before the season at this stage of my career to prepare for," he said.
Trump rally time in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump, launches a series of electoral rallies this evening in Wheeler, West Virginia.
This will be the first rally of five such ones scheduled to be held next week, including stops in friendly areas involving Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the approval vote put on hold for his selection to complete the vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to create support for the next mid-term election since Republicans risk losing control in Congress when polls are conducted in November.
At what time is Trump rally in West Virginia today, and how do we follow it online?
Trump rally in Wheeler, West Virginia, is scheduled to be held at 7 pm. Eastern Time today evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can attend Trump's rally in West Virginia online below, via live broadcast on YouTube.
It is likely Trump will address this week's hearing hearings in the Supreme Court of Candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who was strained due to allegations of his indecent sexual conduct, with the expected confirmation vote by the Senate pending for a week as the FBI carried out the investigation of the case.
But the primary goal of these numerous gatherings is to help Republicans take a leap forward in facing the November election.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign staff said these five rallies in the next week are aimed at "giving energy to volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and in the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Controll of Congress is so important for its agenda that the President will travel to as many states as he can as we turn to the busy campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to be identified said to Reuters.
Planned to take place in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's evening rally can bring support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia news agency Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where it won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to assist the Senate Republican candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has been left behind according to polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a boost in polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team showed readiness to fight while keeping their hopes alive by heading for the singles races on Sunday
After three unilateral seasons, the remaining four for Sunday afternoon, may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
This swing of momentum, it's a totally created sports concept, but a concept where players really believe and never more than in such races.
But where can we say that such momentum is now felt?
"They had a six-point break that has now gone to four, so we can say that some kind of momentum is created I believe," said Jordan Spieth as he closed the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of four points ahead when it stays in the game and twelve points.
As Spieth declares, Americans hope that the odds are in their favor and have many things to be encouraged, in particular from the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day where they received three of the four possible points.
Spieth has been ruthless from firing shots to the pit and is leading by setting his example.
The party cheers were added as the round followed, inserting the golf ball with an easy hit to get the match to the draw, when he and Thomas were previously two points down after two rounds.
His light shot that gave them the win of the match in pit 15 was met with a similar cheerer, indicating that he believes the American team is still not out of the race.
"You just have to work hard and worry about your game," Spieth said.
All players left now.
18 pits to leave a trail.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup story.
The strange but adorable European couple have performed four out of four and can't be mistaken.
"Moliwood" was the only couple that did not catch a shot over the Saturday afternoon minimum, but they also avoided shootings on the minimum also on Sunday morning, Friday evening and on the nine Friday morning shots.
This result and the way their energy appears to flow towards the excited crowd and the analysis reinforces the idea that they are players to be defeated on Sunday, and that there will be no other player better known than Fleetwood and Molinary to seal a possible European victory as the sun sets over "Le Golf National".
Probably both at the same time in different pits.
However, statements of a European triumph are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson managed very easily with Sergio Garcia, the four-hour play hero, when he fell in pairs with Alex Noren.
A point above the minimum and two in the forward nine put the Spaniard and Swedish in a pit from where they had no chance of getting out.
However, on Sunday nobody will be there to help you get out of your pit.
Four games and couples are so amazing to follow closely due to the interaction between couples, of the advice they give, of the advice they don't give and of how a strategy can change there.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a meaningful lead until the final, but these four-year sessions also showed that the US team will still face even though some people, particularly Stateside, have put the matter into question.
Europe leads 10-6 as it heads to the Ryder Cup final day
Europe has a substantial advantage on the Final Day of the Ryder Cup after it has emerged from the four games and with couples with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspiring duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the race with two wins against a Tiger Woods found in difficulty to increase their advantage to four points in âLe Golf National'.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, offered to take the trophy that was lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the helpless American team in the morning doubles matches, leading to 3-1 series of results.
The U.S. team showed more resistance in the four-game, winning two games, but they couldn't reduce the difference.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual matches to hold the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie player to have won four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, nicknamed âMolliwood', after a sensational weekend are the second couple in the history of the Ryder Cup who win four points in their four opening matches.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-game game, they combined quite well together to defeat a helpless Woods and American rookie Bryan Dechambeau with a more dramatic score of 5&4.
Woods, who had difficulty holding two meetings on Saturday, displayed occasional explosions of greatness, but he has already lost 19 of his 29 matches in the four-game and with couples and 7 consecutive matches.
Justin Rose, fired for the morning's four-game match, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the couples game and received a 2&1 loss from Dustin Justin and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third place in the world.
Europe did not have everything in favor on a pretty cool day in the southwest of Paris.
Three times the professional winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas established the difference to be captured by Americans by two points on Saturday.
They received a bold 2&1 win against Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-way matches and returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the match with couples after losing in the first two pits.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team has turned the score after a difference between four points in individual games, even though the Furyk's support team only needs a draw to hold the trophy.
However, since he was the second best player for two days, a counterattack on Sunday appears to be going beyond their reach.
North Korea says it will not be disarmed âin any way' unilaterally without gaining confidence
The North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations that continuing sanctions on Saturday were deepening distrust towards the United States and the country would in no way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual troupe from around the world of the General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant measures that show good will" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling areas where nuclear tests were held, and vowing it would not add to the arsenal of weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we are seeing no responses regarding this from the US," he said.
"Without having faith in the US, our national security will have no confidence and in these circumstances there is no way for us to unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri reiterated North Korea's usual complaints concerning Washington's resistance to a separate approach "in phases" for the nuclear disarmament process where North Korea would be praised because of the gradual steps it has taken, his statement seemed significant because it did not exclude the unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Penani has previously done.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit held for the first time between a incumbent American president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work towards "the Korean peninsula's nuclear threat" while Trump pledged guarantees regarding North Korea security.
North Korea has requested an official conclusion of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has indicated that Penani must initially give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to mitigate strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"US insists that the 'nuclear threat' be carried out initially and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal bindingly, even opposing 'declaring the end of the war,'" said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can kneel us are dreams in the sun of people who are uninformed to us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions is deepening our disbelief."
Rhe did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, a statement the US leader highlighted earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae in the last five months and added: "If the pair in the nuclear disarming issue was South Korea and not the US, the process of nuclear disarming on the Korean peninsula would not have come into this situation without way out."
Despite this, the tone used in the New Speech was deeply different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly, that the deployment of US territory under target with North Korean rockets was inevitable as "Mr. President Devil" Trump called Kim "the rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "destruct it completely" North Korea thanked Kim for the courage shown in taking steps to disarm, but said there is still much work to be done and that sanctions must continue to be active until North Korea performs nuclear disarmation.
Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - that doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Penian for the steps taken.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, said at the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that, "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and without stopping until we realize the complete and final verification of nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously imposed increased sanctions for North Korea since 2006, in an effort to end the funding of Penian's nuclear and ballistic programs and missiles.
Pompeo met with Rit on the sidelines at the UN General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Peniani again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last visit did not go so well.
He left Pennian in July saying there has been progress, and only within a few hours North Korea denounced him for carrying out "mafiic-style demands."
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to disarm a missile area and also a nuclear complex if the United States will undertake "constituency measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "constitutional measures" he sought were security guarantees for which Trump pledged in Singapore and the move towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students take lessons on how to get enough rest
A new Harvard University course this year has included all students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the growing culture of the âmachos' study through the use of caffeine from these 'insults.'
One academic noted that the world's number one university students are often unaware when it comes to the most basic things on how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women's, prepared the course of lectures, who believes it is the first of its kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to start this course after giving a reference on the impact sleep deprivation has on learning.
'At the end of it, a girl came to me and she said, 'Why is this thing being said to me now, in my senior year?'
She said no one had told her before about the importance of sleep - which surprised me,' he said of the 'The Telegraph'.
The course, included on the program for the first time this year, explains to students the necessary elements on how the habits of a good sleep help academic and athletic productivity, and also how it improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of the university medical services, said the university decided to present this course after establishing that students were seriously deprived of sleep throughout the week.
The hour-long course involves a series of interactive tasks.
On one side is a view of a dormitory, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books so they can be explained to them the effects of caffeine and lighting, and how athletic productivity is affected by sleeplessness, as well as the importance of the routine of hours to go to bed.
In another part, participants are explained how sleep deprivation in a long period increases the risks of a heart attack, eshem, depression, and cancer.
A map of the camp, with interactive icons, further encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know - as you also have the right to know, the health impact when you choose to smoke,' Prof added. Czeisler.
The culture of pride to spend âa night of sleep' continues to exist, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was an ever-growing problem.
The assurance that you have taken enough sleep dose, of good quality, should be the students' âsecret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation leads the brain to a hunger mode, causing them to feel constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiaan studying physical and chemical biology, assisted Professor Czeisler in preparing the course, having participated in one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened its eyes and inspired him to turn it into a course for the entire camp.
He hopes that the next step, is to ask all students of postgraduate studies to complete a similar study program before joining competitive institutions.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students put a alarm clock on when to go to bed, and also on when to wake up, and be aware of the damaging effects of the âgreen light' coming out of the electronics screens and LED lighting, which can take out the biological sleeping pace out of work, which leads to problems in the catch of sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga scores against Gerard's sons
Rangers received another hit as visitors as the strike of Dolly Menga gave Steven Gerard's disbanded side a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was seeking to record his first win since the February 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused the second defeat in 18 games Gerard as coach, leaving his team eight points behind the fugitive leader of Ladbrokes Premiership, the Hearts team.
Menga scored seven minutes before completing the first part and with a Rangers team deployment that seemed completely helpless to even.
As Rangers now falls to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is directly behind Hibernian for goal margins.
Rangers can expect to have more trouble as their Capum Spence wing player was treated for a blow to the head after being hit by a likely object thrown by visitors fans.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, which passed Air to the Betfred Cup semifinals.
On the other hand, Holt put the same 11th field which kidnapped a Hearts touchdown last week and that he would feel satisfied with the way his well-organized team drowns opponents in each round.
Rangers may have dominated the holding of the ball, but Livingstone created more when he had it in possession.
They should have scored just two minutes from the start of the meeting, when the first succession Menga gave to Scott Pittman in the gate-protected cadre from Allan McGregor, was not used correctly by him throwing the ball out.
A long cros from the sentence kick by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, only shot him out on the back of the gate.
Rangers took control of the game but they seemed to be more hopeful than they actually believed in their game in the opposing area.
Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a penalty after a quarter hour of play as he and Steven Lawless crashed, but referee Steven Thomson did not hear Colombian complaints.
Rangers managed to perform two hits at the gate at the first half, but former Ibrox reporter, Liam Kelly, was not disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and by the forceless hit of Ovie Ejaria.
While Liv's first goal in the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was being seen in the field, but no one can deny that they deserved only for the quarrel they showed.
Again Rangers failed to serve long passes for Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball towards Scott Robinson, who maintained the calm to cross the Menga and score in a simple way.
Gerard acted on the rest between the parts while replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and this change nearly did not give an immediate effect as the side followed for Morelos, but impressive Kelly ran out of his position to block it.
But Livingston continued to make guests play the way they want to, where Lithgow and Halket followed with each other long balls from time to time.
Hol's team could extend its lead to the final stage, but McGregor stood firm and denied Jacobs before Lithgow shot out of a ball taken from the corner kick.
Rangers' substitute, Glenn Middleton claimed later during the game for another penalty, while he was confused with Jacobs, but again Thomson allowed the advantage.

And now a page from our "Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, Like Today 136 years ago and IN VADIM... the day future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the production of what is known as Geiger meter.
A main pillar of science since then, the Geiger gauge became a main pillar of popular culture as well, as in the 1950 film "Coonado's Stars," with a cast of noted non-professional scientists such as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger gauge used to track radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones in, you can actually hear the effects of atoms that are released from radioactivity to minerals."
Evans: "Don't tell me, I'm really listening right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name goes on living.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "distinguish" poor cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "distinguish" bad cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment
Method includes extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them to the lab
They can âdistinguish' a protein that is common in many types of cancer and then reinject
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients having some types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to know bad cells noticed that ovarian cancer disappeared for over 18 months.
The method includes extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them to the lab so that they can âdistinguish' a protein that is common in some types of cancer called HER2, and then in the reinjection of these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the American National Institute for Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results show us that we are dealing with a highly promising vaccine."
HER2 "nexit the growth of several types of cancer," including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colon, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extract immune cells from patients "to teach" them how to detect cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West appeared at a Pro-Trump rally, wearing a hat with the MAGA inscription, after his show at SNL.
It didn't go right.
Kanye West whistled at protests in the studio during a broadcast on the show "Saturday Night Live", after a disappointing interpretation where he praised American President Donald Trump and where he said he would run for this post in 2020.
After performing his third song for that night called "Ghost Town", where he was wearing a hat placed on his head that wrote "Make America Great", he went on to speak with strong tones against the Democrats and rehesed his support for Trump.
"How many times do I talk to a white person and they say to me, 'How can you like Trump, he's racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a parody featuring Matt Damon, where Hollywood star mocked the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judicial Commission on charges of sexual harassment filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, records of West's harsh speech were commissioned on social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear whether Rock was trying to mock West with that post or not.
Also, West complained to spectators that he had spent a difficult time in the background because of what he had put in the head.
"They mistreated me in the background.
They told me, âDon't go on stage with that hat on your head.'
They mistreated me!
And then they tell me I'm sunk," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West went on: "Do you want to see the sinking?", indicating that "you put my overhead hat on the head, because it shows that no one can tell me what to do. do you want the world to move forward?
Prove your love."
His comments received whistles at least twice from spectators, and SNL cast members appeared to be feeling ashamed, reports Variety, where one person told the newspaper: "The whole studio fell quietly."
West had been called as a late vice-placer instead of Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had passed away a few days earlier.
West surprised many with the interpretation of the song "I Love It", dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the chairman of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who posted on Twitter: "For one of the more courageous spirits: THE FALMINDERS THAT SHOT IN THE TURMY."
But show moderator Karen Hunter posted on Twitter that West simply "was himself and this thing is extraordinary."
"But I choose to reward someone (buying music or clothing or supporting his "art", whom I believe to shame and spreading ideology that is harmful to my community.
And he's free.
So are we," she added.
Before the show, the singer stated on Twitter that he had changed the name, saying he was already "the dog that was previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to have changed his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper fellow, Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and also late Prince music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist who was known as Prince.

'Game of Thrones' star, Kit Harington, hits toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his part as a swordsman in the character Jon Snow, in the violent series of medieval fantasy "Games of Thrones".
But the 31-year-old actor has hit the male hero stereotype, saying that the showdown of such on-screen roles, makes young boys perceive that they should behave as being strong to be respected.
Speaking of âThe Sunday Times Culture', Kit said he believes âsomething has gone wrong' and was asked how to solve the toxic masculinity problem in the #MeToo movement era.
Kitt, who recently married his actress colleague in "Game of Thrones", Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels 'sufficient enough' to resolve this issue.
'Personally I feel very important about this matter at the moment - where have we erred with the show of masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grow up, about the problems we're facing now?'
Kit believes television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to highly male characters appearing there.
He continued: 'What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and what is learned in the street, that makes young boys believe that they should behave in a certain way to feel men?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time - how do we change this thing?
'Cause obviously something went wrong with the new guys.'
During the interview he also admitted that he would no longer shoot for "Games of Thrones" after the series ended at the end of the next summer, saying that âfields and horses are at the edge of his nose'.
From November, Kit will take part in a stage relocation of âTrue West' by Sam Shepard, which is the story of a film producer and his brother thief.
The actor recently indicated that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he received from "Game of Thrones".
'In this production I found the woman, so we can say that this show gave me the next family and determined my life from now on,' he said.
Rose played Ygrite's role, the sentimental interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the science fiction series winner of 'Emmy' awards.
The couple were married in the month of June 2018 on the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/Sida: China reports increase of 14% of new cases
China has announced that there is a 14% increase in the number of citizens who live with HIV and Sida.
There are more than 280,000 people affected throughout the country, health authorities say.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most new cases have been broadcast through sexual relations, featuring a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV quickly spread to parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people receiving HIV through this way had almost gone to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the province of Yunan.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and Sida in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Transmission of HIV through sex is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexualism was de-criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT persons is said to still prevail.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have measured that 70-90% of males who have sex with other males will eventually marry females.
Much of the transmission of the disease occurs because of improper protective measures during sex in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to medical drugs for HIV treatment as part of the effort to hit this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that GOP Senators' data have been spread by staff members, says these are âdangerous lies' and âcospiratory theory'
U.S. representative Maxine Waters denounced Saturday claims that a member of its staff had posted personal information of three American Republican senators on the legislators' pages in Wikipedia.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claimed these claims were being prompted by experts and online "extreme right-right" sites.
"Stories, lies and only disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released is reported to include the home addresses and phone numbers of American Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
Information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing session of sexual misconduct against candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The flow of information came shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Some of the conservative pages such as âGateway Punt' and âRedState', reported that IP addresses identifying the source of publications were related to Waters' office and released the records of a Waters staff member, reports Hill.
"This baseless claim is completely untrue and a great lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - identity, personal information and security of which has been compromised as a consequence of these false and fabricated claims - has in no way been responsible for leaking this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and a great lie."
Waters' statement immediately faced online criticism, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial becomes so frustrating," Fleischer wrote.
"That means she doesn't have the right temper to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, he shouldn't be angry.
It shouldn't be provocative.
It should not question the motives of the accuser.
He must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing overly nervous during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is racing to take over Waters in the mid-term election, also posted his statements on Twitter.
"Great case, if it will be true," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement Waters said her office had signalled "constituency authorities and law-substant institutions on these false charges.
"We will make sure that the authors are discovered," she continued, "and that they assume legal responsibility for all their actions, which have devastating and dangerous effect for any of my staff."
Film review "Johnny English Strikes Again" - comedy with spy unequipped Rowan Atkinson material
It has become random for every new British-influential film to be seen for hidden messages related to Brexit's theme, and this finds application and in the re-playing of the comedy-action venture "Johnny English" - which has the strands in 2003 with "Johnny English" and the 2011 comeback with "The Johnny English Return".
Will this satirical comedy reveal how clearly incompetent we are with new national opportunities in the field of exports?
In any case, the country-eyed character, with his face as a rubber and seemingly helpless Johnny English, has received the authorization to confuse things for the second time - his name, which shows more than anything else that he is a wide comic creature made up for territories where no English is spoken, but who frequents cinema.
Of course he is a deficient secret agent, who despite surprisingly claiming to appear as enchanting, has little from the Inspector Clouseau, few of Mr. Bean's character and a port of that type that only contributed with the release of a sound in the song âChariots of Fire', at the opening ceremony of the Olympics - London 2012.
He is also based on the mystery man, traveler, and Atkinson international, who once played in television commercials that are now forgotten of âBarclaycard', leaving the country in chaos wherever he stepped.
There's a moment or two in the premiere of this film.
I loved it when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in a medieval armour and the propeller sheet crashed a little into his helmet.
Here appears the gift of physical comedy performing Atkinson, but humor appears to be vacant and sometimes excessive, especially when âserious' films like 007 and Impossible Mission have introduced a little bit of comedy as an ingredinent in their films.
Humory seems to address children more than adults and Johnny English's crazy events are not so creative and are focused on voiceless movements, the same as those that Atkinson performs in Bean's character.
The permanent theme as well as in this film is the fact that Great Britain is in serious danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the British agents' super-secret network, revealing the identity of British field agents and lebetting the agent in office - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last chance for a prime minister to appear as a pompous and combat-ready figure, who is already suffering an extraordinary political non-population: Emma Thompson does the best to realize the character resembling Teresa May, but there is not much text in the script that can play.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that every active spy has been compromised, that she will have to rely on someone who has retired.
And that means choosing Johnny English himself, who was now employed as a school principal in a high-class neighborhood, but that unofficially taught how to become a secret agent: there are beautiful scenes here, because English is offering a spy academy in the form of rock school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and is reunited with his former, multi-violated Bough sidekick, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to a submarine captain, in the role of a high-class girl, where Vicki Pepperdine has been used slightly wrong for this role.
So Batman and Robin did things totally backwards at Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action, encountering the beautiful fatal Ophelia Bulletova woman played by Olga Kuryenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being fascinated by the attractive technology billionaire who claims he can solve the difficulties of British computers: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their ridiculous and entertaining Odyssey: disguised as waitresses, set fire to a beautiful French restaurant; cause chaos as they break into the luxury yacht of Volta; and English is completely confused as trying to use Virtual Reality equipment to get acquainted with the insides of Volta's house.
All sequences are normally made for the final scene, but despite being fun and loud, the whole thing looks a little bit like a children's movie.
Pretty moderate stuff.
Even as in other films Johnny English, I couldn't help but wonder: didn't the British film industry have a role for Rowan Atkinson to suit his talent?
The Labourist Party denies that there is a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid in five days
The Lamburist party led by Jeremy Corby is considering a radical plan which would make the British work four days a week - but be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to save by using the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) for employees, giving them an extra day off.
We would see employees enjoying a three - day weekend but continuing to take home the same salary.
Sources said the idea would be âcompared' with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country into a favor for employees.
Passing in a week with four working days is an idea that has been embraced by the Congress of Trades, as a way for employees to benefit from the changing economy.
A high-level source of the Labour Party told the âThe Sunday Times': 'Before the end of the year a policy review is expected to be announced.
'It's not going to happen immediately, but a week with four days' work is an aspiration that coincides with the party's approach to balance the economy in favor of employees and also with the party's overall industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to embrace this idea, where and the Green Party has previously pledged a week with four days of work during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is currently not being supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said, 'One week with four days' work is not party policy and is not being taken into account by the party.'
Chancellor in Shadow, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour party conference to convey his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to pass over power from âunofficial directors' and âwinners' to public service firms.
The Chancellor's plans in the shade also imply that the current shareholders in the water companies may not take back all their shares, because the Labour government can commit âsublime' with the reasoning of actions considered a violation.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on company boards and create Comprehensive Property Funds to pass 10 per cent of private sector firms' capital to employees, meaning a dividend paid annually in value by 5500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy indicate in "60 Minutes", if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh may change their minds
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises questions about whether the findings of the investigation bureau could influence any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be aired on Sunday, the show's "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could discover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more openly than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said that when I was entering the hearing, I said, that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called her after this happened, so after all the claims came up and I said, 'Did you do that?'
He was determined and clear."
Graham's vote, however, looks like it's carved on stone.
"I've made up my mind for Brett Kavanaugh and the change would only make a bomb charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned couldn't verify.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see it's going to change something."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the "Global Citizen" Festival, an annual music show which contains a large and impressive list of stars performing and also have a equally impressive mission; end poverty in the world.
Now, in his seventh year, the "Global Citizen" Festival will host crowds of thousands in the 'Great Lawn' in Central Park not only to enjoy the interpretations of Janet Jackson, Cardy B and Shawn Mendes, but also to be conscious of the real purpose of the show, to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The "Global Citizen" Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the "Global Power Project", an international advocating group, which hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to benefit a free ticket for the show (except on the occasion when you want to pay a VIP ticket), participants must fulfill a series of tasks, or "actions" such as voluntary work, sending an email to a world leader, carrying out a telephone or any other meaningful way that would help raise awareness on reaching their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been when there are 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to convince them to seek these interventions, or is it just another case of what is known as "click-activism" - people who feel they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a message to Twitter?
Since 2011, "Global Citizen" is said to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, giving a boost to various goals.
These actions are said to have helped spur world leaders to declare commitment and policy worth $37 billion, said to affect the lives of more than 2,25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 pledges and statements as a consequence of the group's actions, where at least $10 billion has already been distributed or provided as funds.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have had a direct impact on about 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main pledges include "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of investors and implementing agencies based in the United Kingdom, committed to "helping children grow up with their full potential," promising them to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in this country, after receiving more than 4700 "citation" from the "Global Citizen" activists.
"With support from the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a memory of the past," the ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition" told the crowd in a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after undertaking 5000 actions to call on the United Kingdom to improve feeding for mothers and children, the government stated funding a project, "The Power of Nutrition", which will affect the 5 million women and children who need food interference.
In an answer to the most frequent questions on their website where it was asked, "What makes you believe that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as every senior civic right and as movements against apartheid before us, we will succeed, for together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardie B, Janelle MonÃ¡e are some of the actors who will perform on this year's show in New York, which will be introduced by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. may use the navy for "blocks" to prevent Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
"If necessary" Washington can rely on its Navy to prevent Russian energy from extending to markets, including the Middle East, has revealed US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner's quote.
Zinke claims that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate Syrian government - is a pretext to explore for new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to supply it with energy as they do with Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he is reported to have said.
And according to this official, there are ways of dealing with this problem.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, to block them, in order to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing participants in an activity developed by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a non-profit organization which has personified itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that these approaches are virtually the same.
"The economic outlook on Iran and Russia is more or less the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, as he referred to Russia as "a misleading sleeve" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come after Trump administration has undertaken a mission to increase natural gas exports liquidated towards Europe, thus replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inaccessible" project of the âNord Stream 2' pipeline, which according to Trump, has turned Berlin into a Moscow "rob".
Moscow has consistently stated that the $11 billion gas pipeline project âNord Stream 2', which is claimed to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to bring it to 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the heated controversy of the project by Washington is done simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the same opinion that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose the supplier," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with American Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American attitude has faced opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organization for industry in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the US to stay away from the EU's energy policy and from bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a great problem when a third state intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, the head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously think" if she wants to run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "think seriously" of participating in the race for president after the election in the middle term.
During a rally in the city in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our destroyed government, and this thing involves putting a woman on top," she said according to âThe Hill'.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren hit President Donald Trump during the rally in the city, saying he "is leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is known for her criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanough.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said "that of course before the vote we need an FBI investigation."
However, a survey released Thursday showed that a large part of Warren's own constituencies do not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "potential" voters said the senator should not run, according to the survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Centre/Boston Globe.
Thirty - two percent supported this run.
The survey showed that former Governor Deval Patrick enjoyed greater support to run, where 38 percent supported a possible run of it, and 48 percent opposed this running.
Other high profile Democrat names that have been discussed to race in 2020 include former szv./president, Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the âAssociated Press' reported.
Sarah Palin cites Trak Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted into the army in September.
Monday evening he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident
"What my son is going through, what he is experiencing after he has returned, I can connect him with other families, which feel the spread of the PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are returning to," she told participants at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paul called his arrest his "elefantin in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans, "come a little changed, hardened, come wondering if they get proper respect to soldiers and aviators and other members of the army, for what they have given the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence after an attack on a woman, following a report of domestic violence and arms while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Police Department in Wasilla.
18 states, D.C. support opposition to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and Columbia District are supporting a legal objection to a new American policy that denies asylum to victims who have escaped criminal groups or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district deposited an explanatory document as friends-judges in Washington on Friday, in support of changing asylum-seeking policies, reports NBC News.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace case against Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union has deposited in August against federal policy, has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang members sons," abused her, but American officials denied her asylum request on July 20th.
She was stopped in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace, describes El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries that produce a high number of applicants for asylum in the U.S. because they are states that have widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new policy of asylum-search in the US, restored a decision, of 2014, by the Immigration Appeals Board allowing immigrants without documents to escape domestic violence and apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, General Carl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "injured decades of state, federal and international laws."
"The federal laws require that all asylum applications should be judged according to the facts and specific circumstances of the case, and such a measure conflicts with this principle," it was stated in the friend-to-judge report.
Lawyers further argued in the report that the ban police made to the inflow of immigrants damaged the American economy, indicating their likelihood of becoming entrepreneurs and "furnating the necessary labour arm."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, ordered immigration judges in June to stop providing asylum to victims who escape domestic violence and violence from gangs.
"Azili is available for those who leave their country due to fear or persecution based on race, religious belief, nationality or affiliation in a certain social group or political persuasion," Sessions said on June 11, on the day of policy statement.
Asylum is never meant to alleviate all problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts at Palu as the death balance doubles in a race to find survivors
In survivors, the situation was extremely tense.
"The situation feels quite tense," said 35-year-old mother, Riza Kusuma, while keeping her young, sick son at an evacuation centre in the ruined town of Pallu.
"The ambulance brings troops every minute.
There's no more clean water."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes, extracting their water - submerged items in an effort to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people have been hurt, and hospitals damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 are overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who has broken his back and shoulder, was deployed to Military Hospital outside of Palu, where patients are being treated in external settings because earth shocks still continue.
His eyes filled with tears as he recalled the violent shock of the quake in the hotel room on the fifth floor that shared it with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save herself.
I think I was crushed under the wreckage of the wall," Harris told âAssociated Press', adding that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
"I heard the woman crying and asking for help, but then silent.
I don't know what happened to him and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of âinsulting' with âpropaganda propagandistics'
A week after an official China newspaper placed a four-page ad in an American daily where the joint benefits of U.S.-Chinese trade were popularised, the American ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to distribute its propaganda.
US President Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to the pay supplement of âChina Daily' in âDes Moines Register' - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Ioua - after having accused China of attempted interference in the U.S. congress election held on 6 November, a charge being denied by China.
Trump's allegations that Beijing was trying to intervene in the US election marked what American officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to add pressure to China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to put up advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a growing trade struggle which has seen tariffs draw on each other's imports.
Chinese and American experts have said China's payback fees in this trade war were determined to hit exporters in states such as Iowa, which has supported Trump's Republican party.
Terry Branstad, the American ambassador to China and former governor for a long time in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products towards China, said Beijing has hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion published in âDes Moines Register' on Sunday Branstad wrote that, "Kina is already doubling this harassment by placing propaganda ads in our free press."
"By distributing its propaganda, the government of China is being assisted by the jubilable American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a pay-per-view ad on Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the newspaper kiosks on the street here in Beijing, you will find very few voices against and you will not see any true reflections of the different thoughts that the Chinese may have for China's disturbing economic trajectory, since the media is under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most notable newspapers in China, avoided offering to publish his article," despite not saying which paper was that.
Analysts warn that Republicans are alienating women voters ahead of elections in the middle of term following Kavanaugh scandal
The more leading characters of Republicans to be solidified and to protect the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, ahead of several sexual assault claims, analysts have warned that they will face a severe reaction especially from women, in the upcoming mid-term election.
The excitement on this subject has been extremely high, and many Republicans have publicly stated that they want to continue by voting the candidate.
These things cannot be undone," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University 'School Maxwell told 'The Hill' for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he suspects in Senator Jeff Flake's last minute attempt (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation and that it will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget tomorrow or November," Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior national adviser and spokeswoman for the âMoveOn' progressive group, said the Washington D.C. newspaper Friday.
On Friday morning, the protesters sang âNovember is Coming!' as they were demonstrating in Senate corridors while Republicans taking control of the Judicial Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's run despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, âMic' reported.
"Enthusiasm and Democratic motivation will reach the top," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst told the news page.
"People are saying that it has already been on high levels; that's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among undecided women voters in the suburbs and among young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, while not liking the president, usually don't vote at all."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her sexual assault charges against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested there would be a stern reaction if Republicans continued to support this nomination.
"This has turned into a tangled confusion for GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Committee of Republicans, early last week, according to the âNBC News'.
"It's not only about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed in the accused bank or not, it is also about the way the Republicans have handled this issue and the way they have treated that female," Guy Cecil, director of the Primes USA, said of NBC News, a group which helps select the Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided over who to believe in watching the evidence of Ford and Kavanaugh, with the latter having slightly higher support.
A recent survey by âYouGov' shows that 41 per cent of respondents certainly or most likely trust Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent say they certainly believe it or most likely Kavanaugh.
Also, 38 percent think Kavanaugh, probably or undoubtedly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent say the same about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating claims filed by Ford as well as the other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reports âThe Guardian'.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee, under oath, that Kavanaugh attacked him at the age of 17 while he was in a drunken state.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court, displayed his genital organs before her while at a party during the time they studied in Yale, the 1980s'.
World Wide Web Creator plans to launch new Internet to compete Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is creating a company that aims to rivalize Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, âInrupt,' is a company built by Berners-Lee's open-source platform, called âSoloid'.
âSolid' allows users to choose where their records are stored and which persons are allowed to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview for âFast Company,' Berners-Lee joked that the goal behind âInrupt' is "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of this innovative company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create "the preservation of their personal data on the grid" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, lists of things to do, music lists and other personal and professional tools.
It's the same as having available in a browser and at the same time Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify.
What is unique to the storage of personal data on the network, is the fact that it remains completely in the hands of the user what kind of information will access.
The company calls this "personal power through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's executive director, John Bruce, is to bring together the resources, processes and skills needed to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers contracted to work on this project, and a community of voluntary coders.
Starting this week, technology developers worldwide can create their decentralized applications using available tools on the Inrup website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking with "Facebook and Google if they should present or not a total change where all their business models completely capsize at night.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post in âMedium' published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt mission "is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he founded the World Wide Web Conservation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the network's impartiality debate.
Even while founding Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Network consortium, the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I'm overly optimistic about this new era of the network," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Victoria Cross giving celebrated during World War I for the cleric
The only cleric to have won a Victorian Kryq during World War I in the quality of the warrior, has been commemorated in his homeland, 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel, Honored Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918, in the attack on Bellenge and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never realized he had won the highest British military title.
A memorial stone was introduced by his two grandchildren in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "exclusively symbolic" for the memorial to appear exactly 100 years from the heroic act that awarded the medal to his grandfather.
According to âLondon Gazette', on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann, directed his battalion through the channel of Saint-Quentin "through a dense fog and under the hail of bullets from fields and machine guns."
He then rushed to the line of fire and with a "major" led the battalion forward and seized one of the guns on the battlefield and the only one killed three persons from opposing troops.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions "are something he can never achieve but something that really shows modesty."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, decided from a crown after the parade, which was directed by the band 'Brentwood Imperial Youth'.
Michael Vann said he "feels highly honored that was part of this parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is emerging from the support being given to by many."
MMA fans stayed up all night to follow Bellator 206, but instead saw "Derrkuchen Pepa"
Imagine, you've been up all night to see the 206 Bellator, and then you're taken out of the opportunity to see this major event.
The show by San Jose contained 13 fights, including six fights in the basic package, and would appear in real time at night on channel 5, in the UK.
At 6 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in Britain were surprised when the broadcast changed to show Derricken Pepa.
Some remained unhappy after having stayed up all night until the first few hours, especially for this match.
A fan on Twitter described this pass from the match to a children's cartoon as "an ugly joke."
"There are the rules of government which define that at 6 a.m. that content was not appropriate to and we should switch to a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications in Bellator, when asked about broadcasting.
""Derrkucja Pepa," yes."
Bellator Company President Scott Coker said they would work on programming to include viewers from Britain in the future.
"When I think about recasting, I think we can solve it," Coker said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning, Sunday day and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday with our clock, so Monday with their clock.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed there were many messages circulating and none of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen next time.
We're going to do the five games show instead of six games - as we usually do - try to give more for the fans and maybe overstep the line.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt âinferiative' about his sexuality
Olympic diver, Tom Daley, says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexualityâbut that gave him motivation to achieve success.
The 24-year-old said he had not understood until he went to nine-year-old school that "not everyone was like me."
Speaking the first program on Radio 4 of âDesert Island Discs,' presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out for gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that after becoming a parent, he thought less of winning Olympic medals.
The long-term program's permanent presenter, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off because he is ill.
Showing up as an outsider in Laverne's first program, Dale said that during the time he grew up he felt "inferior" to others because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "To date, those feelings of inferiority, and the fact that I felt different, have been the real elements that gave me the impetus and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that it was worth "something," he said, not to disappoint everyone when they found out about his sexual orientation.
Twice the bronze Olympic medal winner, is already a high profile LGBT activist with high profiles and used his participation at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal more to countries to legitimise homosexuality.
He said he went out because he felt fortunate that he was able to live openly and without consequences and that he wanted to give others "hope."
Three times the world champion said that falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "I was caught up with unprepared."
Last year, Daley married the Oscar Award winner, who is 20 years older than he, but said that the age difference has never been a problem.
"When he experiences so many things at such a young age" - he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age who had experienced the same landing-lifting.
The couple became parents in June, of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "all perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all I thought was âI should win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with head cancer.
Daley said his father didn't admit that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked was if we had the tickets ready for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him âyou wouldn't be in the first row dad," he said.
"I was holding my hand as he stopped breathing and only after he stopped breathing and changed his life I accepted for the first time that and he was not invincible," he said.
Next year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - immersing in front of the local public in the Olympics, there was no more beautiful feeling," he said.
Also, this inspired his first musical selection - Proud from Heather Small - which accompanied him during preparations for the Olympics and continues to cause the mornica.
Desert Island Discs is given to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 p.m., with the British clock.
Mickelson, out of form, was left on the bench Saturday at Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when playing his 47th match at Ryder Cup, but will have to change his form not to turn this historic moment into disappointment.
Mickelson, for whom it is the 12th time to participate in this event, a separate record this, organized every two years, was laid on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk, during the double games (fourballs and fuursoms).
Instead of being the center of action, as it has usually been for the United States, five times the winner of the major titles, spent the day supporting the team and working in hopes of leaving his concerns behind.
Not among the players with the most straight kick even when he was at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not an appropriate player for Le Golf National's complicated field, where the long and difficult fields leave no room for wrong shots.
And if only the fear of the field, Mickelson, on Sunday, in the ninth match will face the 'British Open' champion, Francesco Molinari, who has formed a team with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who have four points less, before starting 12 shots, will start off in a hurry, Mickelson's game can result in decisive results.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, even though he can't say more than that.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a shoulder stroke, threw his hand at my neck and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hall of Fame and he has made a lot of contributions to these teams in the past, and during this week.
I probably didn't think he was going to play two games.
I had thought more, but that's how it turned out, and that's how we thought it was the solution.
He wants to be in the field, like anyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most featured player in the Ryder Cup games.
It may mark the end of his career in Ryder Cup, where he has not been up to his individual appearances.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven drawbacks, though Furyk said his presence brings values to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, sharp, likes to tease people, and he's a fantastic guy for having him in the team room," he explained.
"Also, I think younger players were having fun facing it, during this week, and that was nice to see.
He gives more than just games."
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the great lead can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience, that the considerable lead they have before the last day of the toy games at Ryder Cup, can turn into an unpleasant factor.
Danez made his debut in the 1997 confrontation, in Valderrama, where the team with Captain Sever Ballesteros had a five-point lead against Americans closed the tournament by winning by a very narrow margin, 141â²2-1â²2.
"It reminds itself that we had a great lead in Valderrama; we had great lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won but with much difficulty," said Bjorn, who was photographed after seeing 5-3 victory in âClass 2018' on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 in âLe Golf National'.
So the story tells me and everyone on that team that it's not over.
Tomorrow we'll walk the last march.
We'll go there and do the right thing.
Nothing's over until we get points on the chart.
We have a goal, to try to win this trophy and here is our focus.
I've said it all the time, I'm focused on the 12 players we have on the team, but we're aware of who we're facing - the best players in the world."
Happy with the productivity of his players, in a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to rush into this stage.
Tomorrow we'll face another 'monster'.
The individual performances come out tomorrow, and this is something else that needs to be done.
It's great when you're on the field with a partner, when things go well, but when you're alone, then you're tested in your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to convey to the players, tomorrow you must give the best of yourself.
Now, forget your partner as well as he must go and give the best of himself."
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will hope his players perform better individually than with partners, where the exception is only Jordan Spiegel and Justin Thomas, received three of four possible points.
Furyk himself has experienced both cases of major results returns on the last day, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing to what is considered "the miracle in Medinah" of the European team.
"I remember every word," when asked how his players had motivated the last day Captain Ben Crenshaw, in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we should have a good start, as you saw in Brooklyn and Medinah.
When you get flow in one arm, you put a lot of pressure on the middle fights.
We put the formation based on this thing and we're going to bring the boys out in the order we believe in is the best, as you understand, we're trying to perform a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of starting to reverse the score and will face Rory McIlroy in the lead game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter with European players positioning in the first half of the ranking
"I chose this group and in this ranking that I believe it covers all the way to the games," Bjorn said of his singles selections.
New German battleship production postponed
The new German Navy frigate should have been sent in 2014 to replace the Cold Wartime Fighting but will not be ready until next year due to problematic systems and high costs, local media have reported.
Posting "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the new frigates 'Baden-Wuertemberg-class', has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper 'Die Zeit' which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but problems after sending damaged the fate of the ambitious project.
The four âBaden-Wuertemberg-class' vessels which were ordered by the navy in 2007 will serve as substitutes for the old âBremen-Classs' frigates.
It is known to contain a powerful ball, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and anti-discovery technology (stealth), such as radar detection reductions, red infrastructures, and acoustic waves.
Some of the other important features include longer maintenance periodsâit must be possible for the new frigates to be relocated for more than two years away from the country's ports.
Persistent delays, however, mean that recent technology warships are said to enable Germany to reflect power abroadâwill be obsolete as they enter service, writes âDie Zeit.'
Fregata âfatful' F125, appeared on the first pages last year, when the German Navy officially rejected the order for this ship and turned it back to Blohm & Voss' shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to its builder after surrendering.
Little information was provided on the return reasons, but the media in Germany quoted there as a series of "large effects in software and hardware" that made the ship useless during a war mission.
The problems in programming were particularly important in the Baden-Wuertemberg-class ships because they will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - half the working force of the old âBremen Class' frigates.
It was also found that the ship was extremely overweight, which reduced its productivity and limited the ability of the Navy to add improvements to the future.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons, it is believed to be double the weight of similar categories used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to the physically troubled parts, the price of the entire project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have amounted to a wordless figure of $3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) â out of $2.2 billion that was originally projected.
Problems gripping the new frigates become especially important after recent warnings that the German Navy's power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the defence committee in the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy is "finishing enough ships to move to another country."
The official said the problem had been added over time because the old ships had been extracted from use but had not been replaced with new ones.
He lamented that none of Baden-Wuertemberg-clas' new frigates would be able to join the Navy.
National Trust Observes Secret Life of Bats
A new research being carried out by a company in the mountainous areas of Scotland aims to discover how bats use the ground to hunt for food.
It is hoped that new findings will shed new light on bringing unique flying mammals and will assist defensive activities in the future.
Research by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common bats and those called the soprano pipistrelles as well as brown ears and Daubenton bats in the Inveriewe gardens, in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed at key points throughout the area to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct field studies using hand detectors.
The analysis of the sounds to be performed by experts for all recordings will determine the frequency of bat sound and what each species does.
A report and a map of their habitat will then be drafted to provide a detailed view of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature defense advisor for NTS, hopes that the conclusions will show which habitats are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information would help determine settlement management goods, such as creating grasslands and how to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined significantly over the past century.
They are under threat of construction and developmental works that affect nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting may also pose danger, as the sticky letters or chemical ingredients of building materials display, as well as domestic animal attacks.
Really bats aren't blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a cut.
They use a sophisticated method of finding location through sounds to determine insects and obstacles in flight with precision.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of importance, and 760,000 acres of land in the country, is very serious about bats.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct studies, nest inspections and sometimes engage in rescue programs.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve in Scotland dedicated to bats in Threave, Dumfries and Galloway, which serves as home to eight of the ten bats species in Scotland.
The manager of this reserve, David Thompson, says this place is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have an excellent area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many ancient trees and all the proper habitat.
But there is still a lot about bats that remain unknown, so the work we do here and in other countries will help us to understand more what they need to âdevelop'."
He highlights the importance of performing bat controls before carrying out property maintenance works because there is the possibility that the purposeless destruction of a nest can kill up to 400 female bats and young people, thus destroying the entire population of an area.
The bats of the night are protected and the murder, the harassment and concern of them, or the destruction of their nests is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish clerk near the Trust for Conservation of Night Bats, encourages people to become part of the aid.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species, we just don't know how their population is moving."
Ronaldo denies rape charges as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristian Ronaldo said that the charges of rape against him are "false news," saying that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German news magazine âDer Spiegel,' which published these charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been charged with raping an American woman, named Katryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas, in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that he is then claimed to have paid her $375 000 so as not to talk about the incident.
Speaking in a live video at Instagram, directed at its 142 million followers, just hours after publishing these claims, Ronaldo, 33, considered the reports "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today, false news," the Golden Ball winner said in front of the camera five times.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to become famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's going well," the player added, smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue âDer Spiegel' for these allegations, which they have called "opposed reports of suspicions about private life,".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral damage to the value corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident was said to have occurred in the month of June 2009, in a Palms Hotel and Kazino suite in Las Vegas.
According to documents presented at the Clark District Court, in Nevada, after meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly have gone to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her on anus.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said that "99 per cent" he is a "good boy" that is left in the mud by "one percent."
The document says Ronaldo confirms that the couple had committed sexual relations but that they were with the acceptance of both sides.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and that she had pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to a solution outside the court because she was "named by revenge" and that she was concerned that she would be "publicly tortured."
34-year-old says she is now trying to return the deal because she continues to be traumated by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid by Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer passed to the Italian giants of Juventus in a deal of 100m euros.
Brexit: United Kingdom âwill regret forever' for losing car manufacturers' status
The United Kingdom "will regret forever" if it loses its world leader's status in the production of cars after Brexit, said secretary for business, Greg Clark.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota in the United Kingdom had told the BBC that if Britain were to leave the EU without an agreement, society would temporarily ban production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the border, in the case of outreach without agreement, would cost the loss of jobs.
The factory in Burnaston - which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis models - produced almost 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my judgment, if Britain exits the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the administrative director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed fears of leaving the EU without agreement and of how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW, said that after Brexit will shut down its Mini series factory for a month.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers refer to as the risk of the supply chain in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line functions on grounds "currently just ordered," with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers from the UK and the EU, for custom vehicles.
If, on March 29, the UK exits the EU without an agreement, there may be delays on the borders which, according to this industry, could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold at its factory in Derbyshire inventory of more than a day, the company said, and consequently production would be halted.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's âChiefs' plan for future relations with the EU "is specially built to avoid these controls at the border."
"We need an agreement.We want to have the best deal that will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the moment for the sake of also exploiting this opportunity," he said of Today's program at BBC Radio 4.
"The data, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, shows that we should undoubtedly be able to continue what has been a highly successful supply chain."
Toyota could not determine how long the production would stop, but in long-term terms, warned that added costs would lower the competitiveness of the factory and consequently lead to job reduction.
Peter Tsuvalallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and who is the senior official of the Unite union in the factory, said members are increasingly concerned: "According to my experience at the moment that these jobs are closed, they no longer come back.
A government spokesman said, "We have set a punctual and reliable plan for our relationship with the EU in the future."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's summit with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may also be "cut down for a week" as the war for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's interference in the election, ties between Trump and Russia's assistive personnel, and the possibility that the president has hampered justice.
Discussion whether Trump will dismiss or not the deputy general prosecutor from office, thus endangering Mueller's independence, is something that creates rumors for months in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times, reported that Rosenstein considered placing a bug to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied that news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, amid reports that he was close to resigning.
Contrary to expectations, a meeting with Trump, located at the United Nations headquarters in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he "would prefer" not to dismiss Rosenstein but then the meeting was pushed to avoid a collision with the hearing held by the Senate's judicial committee, where they witnessed Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who have accused him of indecent sexual behavior.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh, further deferring the full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was present today at Fox News Sunday.
When asked about meeting Rosenstein, she said, "There's not yet a date set, it can be this week.I think it can be postponed another week given everything else that's going on with the Supreme Court.
But, let's see, and I always like to keep the press up-to-date."
Some journalists may object to this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Modernist Chris Wallace raised the question of why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences did not result in dissatisfaction with the attitude of television journalists," although she said, "I will not deny that they attract attention."
She then hinted that direct contact will increase between Trump and the press.
"The president performs more sessions of guaranteeing quality than any other president before him," she said, adding, without citing data: "We've seen these figures."
There will continue to be press conferences, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, then that's much better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you've seen that we've done it often over the past few weeks, replacing press conferences in cases where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or when attending open sessions, or at press conferences with important personalities.
Individual press conferences are rare.
The President probably showed the reason for this fact, this week, in New York, where he made a controlled appearance and in some strange cases, in front of journalists.
Health Secretary writes to employees from the EU, in NHS Scotland, about fear over Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to the staff from the EU working at NHS in Scotland, to express gratitude on behalf of the country and to the desire to stay even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, the deputy of the Scottish parliament, has sent a letter, when they have remained even less than six months from the UK's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already taken over to cover the costs of application for permanent residence status for EU citizens working in public services at the local level.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations have continued on the UK's departure from the EU, approaching making a decision in the fall.
But the UK government has also intensified its preparations in the case of an agreement-free scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you all.
For this reason, I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from the EU and beyond bring in valuable experience and skills that increase and improve the work of health care, increasing the benefits of patients and communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is obviously your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgical surgery after injury to the head
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent immediate surgery after head injury suffered on Saturday, in loss 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, the reporter of The Tennessee, Mike Organ, reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the first half.
"He came to the side line and fell there," said Reed.
Coachs and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing it on the stretch and sending it for further examinations.
An official of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, that Abercrombie had completed surgical intervention at the Vanderbilt Hospital Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details on the type/scale of damage" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He performed five interventions Saturday before leaving the game, leading to 18 the total number of interventions during the season.
Foreign national buyers will pay higher stamp tax when purchasing a property on the UK
Foreign national buyers will pay higher stamp tax for purchasing a property in the UK, and additional money will be used to help the homeless according to new Conservative Party (Tory) plans.
This move will neutralise the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters
The stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay taxes at the UK
Treasury Department predicts collecting up to 120 million GBP annually to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign national buyers will pay higher stamp tax for purchasing a property in the UK and additional money will be used to help the homeless.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters with promises to offer more affordable housing and to "strik" persons with high profits.
The stamp tax will apply on individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, while additional money will support the government's initiative to fight housing shortages.
This extra fee - which is added to the current stamp tax, including the tax rate increase introduced two years ago for the second houses and for the properties purchased to be leased - could amount to up to three percent.
The Treasury Department predicts this move will accumulate as much as 120 million GBP annually.
About 13 per cent of the recently built properties in London are purchased by people in residence outside the UK, which causes price hikes and makes it more difficult to find housing from buyers for the first time.
Many wealthy areas of the country - especially in the capital - have returned to "physical cities" because of the high number of foreign national buyers spending most of their time abroad.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for reducing the stamp tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of keeping high prices by buying land but not putting it into use, and urged Mrs May to give up quotas for affordable homes, in order to regulate Britain's "brief with properties."
Mr. Corbyn has proposed several attractive housing reforms, including rent control and the removal of "no reason" evacuations.
Also, he wants to give more power to counsel to build new houses.
Mrs May said, "Last year I stated that I would dedicate the term of the prime minister to the return of the British dream - well, for a better life for any new generation.
And that means fixing the troubled home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in the UK and foreign societies have a simpler time to buy homes than British workers.
For many people, the dream of having a home owned has become something too difficult to achieve, and injustice to the homeless is more than real."
Jack Ross: 'My greatest ambition is to train Scotland'
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's coach at a certain stage.
Scocezi, 42, is enjoying the challenge of re-establishing the north-east club, which is currently positioned in third place in League One (the third category), three points away from the head.
He came this summer to the Light Stadium after returning St Mirren to Premier Scottish League last season.
"I wanted to play for my place as a player.
I appeared once in Representative B and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsground.
"But as a child I grew up seeing many times Scotland in Hampden with my father, and it's something that has always attracted me.
However, this opportunity will come only if I am successful in running clubs."
Ross' ancestors in the direction of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moses, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach says he is not concerned that he is following the footsteps of these great names in such a large club, as he has previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For the moment, my success will depend on the fact that 'I can turn this team into Premier League?'
Given the structure and facilities of this club, it certainly belongs to Premier Liga," he said.
"It's not a simple task to go there, but I would see myself as successful only if I could get the club back to Premier Liga."
Ross has only started three years of his career as a coach after a period as an assistant coach in Dumbarton and a 15-month period in Hearts' leadership staff.
He then helped Alloa climb a category higher up to the third round of the cup, as well as transformed St Mirren from a club near the fall from the category to Championshipship's title winners next season.
And now, Ross says he feels better than he has ever felt during his career as a player for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"Maybe it was really a turning point," he says, for taking the lead of Alloa.
"I really believed that training was the right thing for me, rather than being a player.
It seems strange because I played well, I lived a good life thanks to this profession, and I enjoyed some good achievements.
But being a player can be tough.
You have to go through a lot of things, every week.
Again, I experience a lot of stress and pressure from work, but training seems to be the right job.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing something like that.I've never been so good and so my whole life as an adult."

According to one study, the perfect time to "drink a beer" is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has increased locals' income in difficult situations in Britain, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data shows that sales in local and bar groups increased by 2.7 per cent in July - but restaurant purchases declined by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, business consultant at the CGA, who compiled the data, said "The ongoing sunny weather as well as England's participation in the World Cup longer than expected influenced July to pursue the same trend as June, where local sales grew by 2.8 per cent, while restaurants recorded even higher declines.
Shooting in restaurants dropped by 1.8% in June, and deteriorated further in July.
Bars and locals with the main activity of offering drinks recorded the best performance, with higher growth than reducing trade in restaurants.
Locals with main activity food delivery also recognized declines as a result of sunny weather, though not as significant as restaurants.
Looks like people just want to go for a drink.
Sales of drinks in bars and locals rose by 6.6 percent that month, while food fell by three percent."
Paul Newman, free time and hospitality analyst in RSM said, "These results confirm the tendency we have seen since the end of the month of April.
When it comes to sales in the nonhouse market, the weather and impact of important social or sporting events remain the main factors.
No wonder restaurant groups continue to face difficulties, although a drop in sales at 4.8 percent a year will have a particularly serious burden considering constant cost pressure.
The long and hot summer could not come at a more difficult moment for food operators, and the time will show whether the average temperatures of August will provide the most unwelcome calm."
The total increase in sales in locals and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launch.
The Coffer Peach Index of Industry Sales, for the Bar and Restaurant Sector in the UK, collects and analyses data from 47 societies, with total laps of more than 9 billion GBP, and is the industry's reference point.
One in five children have secret accounts in social media that they hide from their parents
According to one study, one in five children - some of whom no more than 11 - have secret accounts in social media that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 nine-year education students showed increase of "false Insta" profiles
This news has increased the fear of sex-contained postings
Twenty percent of students stated they have a "primary" account that they show to parents
One in five children - some of whom are not more than 11 - are opening up accounts in social media, which adults secretly use.
A survey of 20,000 nine-year education students showed rapid increase in "false Insta" profiles - related to the site for photo distribution, Instagram.
This news has increased the fear of sexual content postings.
Twenty percent of students said they use a clean "primary" account that they show to their parents, but they also have private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, found that a teenager urged others "to rape her."
Research of Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors ("Headmasters and Headmistresses" Conference - HMC) of Independent Schools, revealed that 40 percent of the age group 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchan said, "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create social spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eiconnect Doyle will be "voice of athletes" on Scotland Athletics board
Eiconnect Doyle has been selected on the Athletics board in Scotland, in the post of non-eczecutive director of this governing body, during the annual meeting of the general assembly.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish track and field athlete, and chairman Ian Beattie described this decision as a great opportunity for all sports executives to benefit from its extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilink enjoys massive respect in the community of athletics in Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit extremely much by making it part of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to serve as the voice of athletes and I hope very much that I will contribute and help run sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the race of 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, with four Olympic gold medals in total and who is a regular expert at the BBC, lost the ability to walk after a temporary usic stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time will tell if I'm recovered and to what extent.
It took a grueling job, but I was able to recover fully, learned to walk again, and today I am doing skill exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
The breast pump commercial comparing mothers to cows shares public opinion
A breast pump manufacturing company has shared public opinion with an ad that compares mothers breastfeeding to cow milking.
To start promoting what is considered "the world's first silent and soundless breast pump and that can be worn," consumer technology products society, Elvie, featured a funny music video, to advertise the freedom this new pump gives to mothers who need to express themselves freely.
Four real mothers dance in a cow stud filled with grass under the sound of a song with lyrics as follows: "Yes, I milk myself, but my tail didn't" and "If you hadn't noticed, these aren't sis, it's my chest."
The refrain goes on to: "Pop, pump, feed the baby, pump, pump, milk the ladies."
However, the ad, which has been published on the firm's Facebook page, has caused online debate.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received friendly reactions from viewers, with many of them expressing that it underestimates the "takes" of the milk industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product is a very poor decision.
Like us, they must remain "sitted" and "born" to produce milk, only that their "bebeths" are taken from them a few days after they are born," someone wrote.
Elvie Bay pump is placed within rechipets and not noticed (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Clearly traumatic for mother and child.
Why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can hold their babies?"
Someone else added, "What advertisements without sensitivity."
Others supported the ad, among which one woman admitted that the song seemed "to laugh."
"I think this is a genius idea.
I would have bought one if you were still breastfeeding the baby.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy but I saw what it means.
This is a genius product," someone wrote.
Another commented: "This is a funny advertisement addressing mothers who use the pump (often in the workplace or toilet) and who feel like "lopas."
This is not an ad that values or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women's group shows that they've all danced with the "shadow" pump placed on the rechipets.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the record that many females using breast pumps say they feel that cows feel.
However, the Elvie pump is silent, there are no threads or tubes, is placed within the recippets and is not noticed, giving females the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even get out while they use it.
Anna Balarin, partner and ECD (Creatative Executive Director) in Mother commented: "The Elvis pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative promotion.
By making a parallel between females who want to express themselves freely and milk cows, we wanted to point out the use of the breast pump and the challenges they face, also displaying in a fun and similar way the extraordinary sense of freedom that the new pump gives.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump comes out on the front page.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared in the postarela of stylist Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children have quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of banned immigrant children has increased even though the monthly number of crossings to the border has remained relatively same, in part due to the rhetoric and strict policies introduced by Trump administration that have made sending children to their supporters difficult.
Usually, most supporters have also been undocumented immigrants themselves, and have been afraid of risking their stay in the country by attempting to apply to take a child.
The danger increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adult persons of the same family would have to give fingerprints, and these records would pass on to immigration authorities as well.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Agency, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 per cent of the people arrested had no prior criminal precedents.
"About 80 per cent of individuals who are supporters or members of the family of supporters stay in the country illegally, and a large portion of them are foreigners with criminal precedents.
So, we are continuing to follow these individuals," said Mr Albence.
According to housing workers, attempting to process children's records more quickly, officials introduced new regulations requiring some of them to appear in court within a month from the time of the ban, rather than after 60 days, as was the previous standard.
Many of them will be presented before immigration judges through videoconferences, and not physically, to argue their request for obtaining legal status.
Those who do not qualify will be deported immediately.
According to housing workers and reports taken by the system in recent months, the longer children remain banned, the more likely they are to feel anxious or become depressed, which could lead to violent explosions or attempts to escape.
Supporters say that these concerns are more severe in terms of greater places like Tornillo, where, because of the size, it is more likely to bypass the signs that indicate a child has difficulty.
They add that moving children to the tent town without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends can cause trauma that many of them already face.
Syria asks American, French and Turkish 'invasion forces' to withdraw immediately
During his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moalem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has already entered the eighth year.
Mowalem, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, stated that foreign forces remain in Syrian land illegally, on the pretext that they fight terrorism, and that "they will act with them in the proper way."
"They have to withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he stated during the assembly.
Mowalem insisted that "the war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have been deported from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight in this holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign forces."
The United States has about 2000 troops in Syria, which mainly train and advise the Kurdish forces and Arab Syrians who are opposed to President Bashar al-Asad.
France has more than 1000 troops in this war-divided country's territory.
On the refugee issue, Mowalem said conditions are good for them to return, and blamed "some Western countries" for "opening irrational fears" that drive refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They are politicising an issue, which should be entirely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide assistance to rebuild Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral area in the last major fortress of rebels in Idlib has created opportunities to move forward with political discussions.
The Russia-Turkey agreement avoided a large-scale attack of Russian-backed Syrian forces in this province, where three million people live.
However, Mowalem underlined that the agreement had "clear guides" and voiced confidence that military attacks will target jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front related to Al-Qaeda, who "will be exterminated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon call the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for the election.
Mowalem set forth the conditions for the government's participation in this committee saying that the work of the panel should be limited "to reviewing the provisions of the current constitution," and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump Will Win Second Term
According to this logic, Mr Trump will be re-elected in 2020 except when, as many people with liberal views hope, accusations and scandals end his presidency prematurely.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of a presidency in history!"
So far, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers during peak hour has doubled to 1,05 million on CNN and has nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average viewer of 2.4 million during peak time, out of 1.7 million that was four years ago, while MSNBC's program, "The Rachel Maddow Show", has reached the top of the cable channel classification with 3.5 million viewers during major events.
"This is a fire, to which people retreat because it is something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the director of the drama series at ABC "Designed Survivor," which tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Singing Into the Hollywood Boys," there is another theory.
It brings to memory a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver had told him he would vote for Mr Trump.
She asked him.
He had replied, "Because it makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
There are fun values in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families can join and the health of the global economy.
Disregard is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, if you find yourself after six hours seeing a panel of experts debating the use of "undisposed information" by Bob Woodward in his book "Far," the strummy-skin bomb jacket of Paul Manafort, worth 15,000 USD ("a clothes filled with arrogance," said The Washington Post) as well as the implications of Stormy Daniels' live descriptions, for Mr. Trump's anatomy, then this goes beyond being an informed citizen.
At least I'll never see Super Mario again the same way.
"A part of what he does and that makes it look like a âreality show', is that you feed on something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Paul Stars," regarding the circulating actors and the unexpected daily developments of Trump's program (dates with N.F.L., praises to Kim Jong-un).
You can't leave an episode without watching or you're left behind.
When I went to Mr. Fleiss this week, the weather was sunny and the outside temperature was 80 degrees, outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he had been hiding inside, watching MSNBC, while recording CNN.
He could not leave, not while Brett Kavanaugh would face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the thread.
"I remember when we accomplished all those crazy programs in the past and the people who said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke but it resulted in being right."

Money from outside the private sector flows into close race for Congress election
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania area is facing an influx of cash, as a consequence of the reorganisation of constituency that forces two officials in office to race for the same post.
This recent reorganisation in the suburban areas of Pittsburgh has put Democratic representative Conor Lamb - who won the post in another area, in the special election, last spring.
Lamb is running against another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12 area of Pennsylvania, to which the new area of 17.
This new map division came after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision, which, in January, said the old areas were unconstitutionally and unfairly assigned in favor of the Republicans.
This race, in the new area 17, has also fostered a strong confrontation in financing campaigns from the main party funding bodies, the Democratic Committee for Congress Campaigns (DCCC) and the Republican National Committee on Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close-up victory in the March-wide special election, for Pennsylvania's 18 constituency.
For more than a decade, that post was held by the Republicans, and President Donald Trump won the area by 20 points margin.
Political experts see Democrats as easy favourites.
US takes into account of penalising El Salvador for support to China, then retires
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little impetus from Washington.
Mr Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama, in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the management team of Trump Organization.
State Department officials decided to remove the American chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama due to "the latest decisions not to know Taiwan anymore," said department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, during a statement earlier this month.
But penalties were only reviewed against El Salvador that received a bailout of about 140 million USD from America, in 2017, including for control of narcotics, development and support of the economy.
The proposed penalties, which included reductions of financial assistance and certain restrictions on granting visas, would be serious for the Central American country and for its high levels of unemployment and murder.
As domestic meetings achieved progress, officials of countries of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic well-being to attend a similar meeting last year, a move that was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from heading towards the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted conferences to take place, ending any opportunity to impose penalties on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has planned to give speech at the conference, which is forecast in mid-October, a signal that shows the importance the administration devotes to this meeting, diplomats said.
And all three American envoys, quietly returned from El Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic, without strong messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House official for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal discussions, provided their anonymity was maintained.
Their explanations were confirmed by an analyst close to the administration, who also spoke, demanding the right to anonymity.
Study history
The next event expected to take place may be special prosecutor Robert Mueller's report for possible obstruction by Mr Trump, for which there is considerable evidence in public records.
It is reported that Mr Mueller is shifting his investigation to prove whether during his campaign, Mr Trump has collaborated with Russia in attacking our election.
If Congress changes arm, Mr Trump will have to account before this organ, at a time when preparing to appear before voters again, and perhaps eventually may face an independent jury.
These are very if, and I don't want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall - or that of his counterparts in Europe, is inevitable.
All of us, from both sides of the Atlantic, must make choices that will affect how long the conflict will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to take coups against Hitler, if the West had resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on these turning points, which accelerate or delay the unstoppable journey of democracy.
At present, Americans face some of these turning points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump sacks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fates of investigating Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has not been in a difficult situation since this newspaper reported, over the past year, that he had suggested secretly eavesdropping on the president, as well as speculated that he is not fit to stay in office.
Mr Rosenstein said that The Times article is incorrect.
"How will we respond if the new investigation required by the F.B.I. for Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite allegations based on sexual assault and false evidence?
And above all, will we vote in the next election for a Congress that will hold Mr Trump responsible?
If we fail in these tests, then democracy will face a long winter.
But I believe that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz from the same Nazi regime that occupied the residence of ambassadors where I lived.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles at that table bearing the symbol of swastika (broken cross).
Having this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers player Graham Dorans is optimistic before facing Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, Rangers wait for Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory in front of the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain in front of Villareal, earlier this month, would put them in a favourable position to qualify in the Group G, of the League of Europe.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorans to make the first appearance this season in the 2-2 draw to Villareal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a push to achieve larger things.
"It was an important point for us because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We entered the field believing that we could get something and came out with a point.
Maybe we could have scored in the end but, in general, I believe the tie was a fair result.
Maybe they were better in the first half as we featured in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday, it will be another major European evening.
I hope we can get the three points but it will be a tough match because they achieved a positive result in their past match, but, with the fans supporting us, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was very difficult, due to injuries suffered and changes in the club but now there is a positive factor in this team.
The team is fine and the boys are enjoying it very much; the training goes well.
I hope we can move forward, throw the last season behind us and succeed."
Females sleep less as a result of fear of retirement savings
Despite having a clear idea of how family members wanted to care for them, very few people talked to them about it.
About half of individuals in the Nationship study said they talked to their spouses about long-term care costs.
Only 10 per cent responded that they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of society for life insurance, Nationwide.
Here's where we have to start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you unless you first show your wishes.
Work with the councillor and with your family, and discuss where and how to take care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Also take your financial advisor: the Councillor can help you find a way to pay your expenses.
Options for financing long-term care include a traditional security policy for long-term care, hybrid police for life insurance with savings to help cover these spending or self-security through your wealth - as long as you have money.
Prepare legal documents: Avoid legal battles through a warrant.
Take a health care proxy and assign a trusted person who will oversee your health care and ensure that experts act in accordance with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also consider taking a proxy for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions in your name and guarantee payment of bills if you cannot do so yourself.
Remember small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about the allergies and the medications it takes?
Prepare a written plan in these details so that you are ready.
"Not only is the financial aspect in the game, but also who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What medication will be used?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare this plan."
One person is shot several times with air rifles at Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air rifle as he went home after spending the evening outside.
The victim, about 40-year-old, was located in the Oxford Grove area, in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers stated that this was a "autocidal act", which occurred at around 02:30 BST.
The victim did not see the aggressor.
Injuries taken pose no risk to life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian town of Palu on Friday, officials have stated as the death toll is expected to rise.
With out-of-function communication networks, aid workers have failed to obtain information from the Donggala regent, an area north of Palu, which was closer to the magnitude of the 7.5-sized earthquake epicenter.
In Palu, more than 160,000 people have been evacuated after this catastrophe.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of nearly 379 800, in 2017.
The town was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regent extending to more than 300 km (180 miles) the coastline length to the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
Regenta, a region smaller than the province, had an estimated population of about 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and livestock are the province's main economic activities, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Neicel extraction is also important in the province, but is mainly focused on Morowali, on the other side of the coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Agency for the Consumption of Disasters in Indonesia, Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunami over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami took the lives of more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, another tsunami hit the western part of Donggala, causing nine casualties.
Indonesia is located in the seismic area of the Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly struck by earthquakes.
The following are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a powerful earthquake on the western coast of the province of Aceh in Indonesia, in the northern part of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 states, causing 226 000 casualties along the Indian Ocean coastline, of which more than half lived in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds lost their lives on the island of Nias Island, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-sized earthquake hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that crashed on the south coast and claimed the lives of about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-sized earthquake in the vicinity of the city of Padang, the capital of the province of western Sumatra.
More than 1100 people were left dead.

Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on charge of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Alaska governor and vice candidate for president, Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of aggression.
According to a report presented on Saturday by the Alaska state police, Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a family violence suspect, for obstructing family violence reporting, and for opposing arrest.
According to the police report, when a female, his acquaintance, attempted to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he picked up his phone.
Palin is being held in the Mat-Su detention building and is being held to a guarantee in the form of uninsured bonds worth $500, KTUU reported.
According to this network reports, he was presented to the court on Saturday and when asked on plea, stated that "he is absolutely innocent".
Palin faces three category A violations, meaning he can be imprisoned by one year and fined $250,000.
Also, he has been charged with a B category violation, which is sentenced to one day in prison and $2000 fine.
It is not the first time criminal charges have been brought against Paul.
In December 2017, he was charged with attacking his father, Todd Paul.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
This case is currently being considered by the Veterans' Court in Alaska.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence reporting, and drunken guning during the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he had punched him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans' groups after linking her son's violent behavior with the PTSD (post-traumatic stress syndrome) as a result of service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have lost their lives on Friday, as a result of an earthquake that has hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5-sized earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electric and communication networks are out of service, and the death toll is expected to increase over the following days.
The earthquake hit the central part of Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
On social media there are videos showing the moment of the hit.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach, in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for terrorist attack suspect in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York but seek the death penalty for Sayfoulo Saipov, the terrorist attack suspect in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare sentence that has not been given for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out the terrorist attack on a bike route along the western highway, in lower Manhattan, stepping foot and cyclist.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov has killed the eight victims "with premeditation" and that it has caused serious bodily injuries "with premeditation", according to the letter intended to seek the death penalty, laid down in the southern district of New York.
According to a court document, both charges could be given the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a major federal jury placed Saipov in front of 22 lawsuits, including eight counts of murder in aid to organised crime, charges often used by prosecutors in organised crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
This attack has come as a consequence of "a considerable and premeditated planning," prosecutors voiced, describing the way Saipov executed crime as "disgusting, cruel and without morals."
"Sayfillo Habibulaevic Saipov caused injuries, injuries, and losses to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Clives, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlie, Hernan Ferruchi, Hern Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," is written in the letter of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last time New York's southern district prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment, in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used in a federal case in New York, was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of having carried out conspiracy and espionage for the benefit of the Soviet Union, two years before the Cold War.
Both were executed in electric chair, on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, of Uzbekistan nationality, showed no penance during the days and months following the attack.
He has stated before the investigators that he feels good about what he has done, police reported.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his mobile phone.
Police stated that he had also sought to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He has stated he is innocent of 22 lawsuits.
David Patton, one of the public lawyers representing Saipov, said they are "very disappointed with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty, and not admitting the guilty, associated with life imprisonment without access, will increase even more the trauma caused by these events to all persons involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative Party MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be placed at the helm of Brex negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today, during a protest at the Conservatory Conference, that he would 'mobilize the people' army.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should 'feel pressure' of Eurosceptics - after one of the MPs of Theresa May suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK 'would be out' if Brexit's secretary were Mr. Farage.
But the challenge Mrs. May faces to join her grouping is noted by the pro-EU conservatives who joined another protest in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is facing difficulties in implementing the compromise plan reached at Chequers, amid attacks coming from those wishing for the position or departure from the European Union, as well as from the EU itself.
The Allies insist that it will attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels despite harsh reactions - and will force Eurosceptics and labourers to choose between its package and chaos'.
During the Portion March means Distance, Mr. Bone stated that he wants to abandon the Chequers deal.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be put in charge and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he were in charge, now we'd be out,' he said.
Wellingborough MP added: 'I'll support Brexit but we have to abandon the Chequers deal.'
Expressing his stance against the EU, he said, 'We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to chart our laws in our country.'
Mr. Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British have changed their minds and desire to stay in the EU is completely untrue.'
Conservative Andrea, who supports Brexit, was also on the march and said to reporters: 'I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
''The Chequiers agreement is not supported by the general public, the opposition will not vote it, neither is it supported within our party, and by activists filling the streets and voting us.
Please abandon Chequers and start listening.'
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: 'The prime ministers keep the job in cases where they keep the promises.'
Mr Farage said during the march that politicians should 'feel pressure' if they are thinking of abandoning the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'Now, this is an issue that is related to the faith between us - the people - and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell him that 'we won't let you do something like that'.'
During a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want you to force our political class, which is close to abandoning Brexit, to feel the pressure.
'We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and we will not stop until the United Kingdom is independent, proud and government itself.'
Meanwhile, they marched to Birmingham before holding a two - hour, downtown rally.
A small group of activists held placards where the Conservators against Brexit were written, following the appearance of this grouping at the weekend.
The sponsor of labers Lord Adonis ironinized with Conservatives about the security problems they had with a "social application", during the start of the conference.
'These are the people who tell us they can prepare TI systems and technology needed for "Canada plus", for open borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland,' he added.
It's totally a farce.
There is no such thing as the good Brexit,' he said.
Warren plans to 'carefully examine' the possibility of running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren has stated that she will "carefully review the possibility of running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democratic Senator spoke of its future during a meeting in the municipality, held on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, an ongoing critic of President Donald Trump, runs for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was a co-director of Trump's campaign, in 2016, in Massachusetts.
She has been at the centre of speculation that she could run in front of Trump, in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon organised meeting at Holyoke was its 36th meeting with the constituencies according to the municipal format, since Trump came to the top.
One of the participants asked him if he is planning to run for Presidents.
Warren replied that the time has come for "the children to go to Washington and fix the broken government, and this also includes placing a female in charge."
Arrested a person for killing LSU team player, Wayde Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday, that he has arrested a suspect in the murder of basketball player Wayde Sims during the Friday day.
Dytheon Simpson, 20, has been arrested around 11 a.m., the Police Department in Baton Rouge announced, through a press conference.
Police had released a video of Friday shootings where they sought help to identify the person appearing there.
Sims, 20, was shot with firearms and killed near South University campus, during the morning of Friday.
"Wayde Sims switched lives as a consequence of gunshot wounds caused to the head," said on Saturday for 247sports, Police Chief Murphy J. Paul.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene, carrying a gun, and that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and sent to custody at the police department in the eastern area of Baton Rouge.
Sims, tall 6'6', played 32 games, of which 10 as a titler, last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 balls on the chart for the match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title as team instructions give Sebastian Vettel victory
As of the moment Walter Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes team guidelines" would play a considerable role in this race.
Bottas left the first place and almost "trolled" Hamilton after defending his position on the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate of the team.
Vettel was the first to make a stop and let Hamilton compete in "trafficking" at the end of the car pile, something that should have resulted in decisive results.
Mercedes made the stop a lap later and was positioned after Vettel, but Hamilton came to the top after several manoeuvres forcing the Ferrari pilot to leave space inside after a double move to be protected at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started the race from the last line and at the end of the first lap was ranked seventh, on the day of his 21st birthday.
He was then in charge in a large part of the race as he did not switch the tires to reach a fast finish and passed Kimi Raikkonen by ranking fourth.
Eventually, he made a stopover on the 44th lap but failed to improve the pace on the remaining eight laps by releasing Raikkonen's fourth place.
It's a tough day because Walter did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team has done an extraordinary job with these interchanges of positions," Hamilton said.
We use our body language very weak
President Donald Trump ironed Senator Diane Feinstein during a rally Saturday, over her insistence, that she was not the person who "inducted to the square" Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, of sexual assault.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the evidence given by Ford before the Senate Judicial Committee, but said that what was happening in the Senate shows that people are "law, bad and insincere."
"The only thing that can happen and the beauty of what's going on in the Senate over the last few days is when you look at anger, when you see people being angry, wicked, bad and insincere," he said.
"When you look at publications secretly released and then people who say "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, were you the ones who put the paper out?
Remember her answer... did you get the document out - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't get it."
Wait a minute.
Did we...no, we didn't," he said, imitating the senator.
In July, Feinstein was sent letters with details of the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford and the document was released earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the information had come out of her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't bring up her story in public," Feinstein told the commission, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it that way, as she asked me to."
But apparently her denial was not acceptable to the president, who commented during the Saturday evening debate: "In my opinion, gestures really left to be desired.
Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen weaker gestures before."
Taking into defense the candidate for the Supreme Court, who has been accused by three women of indecent sexual behavior, the president indicated that Democrats are using alleged charges to achieve their intentions.
"They are determined to regain power at any cost.
They don't care who they hurt, who they should step on to get power and control," Media reported as words spoken by the president.

Air traffic controller loses his life making sure hundreds of people on a plane escape the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being honored as a hero after losing his life by ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people would land safely.
Over 800 people lost their lives and many others have been reported missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong waves continue to disturb the area, and many are trapped in the town of Palu.
But, despite having his colleagues fled to rescue, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agong refused to leave his post in the control tower shaking rapidly at Palu Airport "Mutiara Sis Al Jurri Airport".
He stood to ensure that Batik Air's 6321 flight aircraft, which was on the runway at that moment, could be safely launched.
He was then thrown out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later lost his life in the hospital.
â Air Navigation Indonesia's spokesman, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he lost his life this morning, before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"This news breaks our souls," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, while the local agency to mitigate the consequences of disasters says that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
â It is believed that this number will continue to rise, as there were still many bodies under the rubble, while others have not been found," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves reaching up to six metres have destroyed Palou, where a massive mortore ceremony will be held on Friday.
Military jets and merchants are bringing supplies and aid.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said of âSky News": "Every minute ambulance brings troops.
There's no clean water.
Mini-markets have been looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said of CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
The president of Indonesia, Yoko Widodo, arrived on Sunday in Palu and addressed the country's army: "I am asking you to work day and night to carry out every task related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was struck by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people lost their lives.
A plane crash in Micronesia: "Air Niugini" now says a person is missing after a plane crashed into the lagoon
The airline running a plane which crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now declared a missing person, having stated earlier that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the aircraft that was sinking into the water.
In a press release, â Air Niugini" said that Saturday afternoon they were not finding a passenger.
The airline said it was collaborating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in an effort to find the person.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boat helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been escorted to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and that all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the collision and the very consequences of the events remain unclear.
The U.S. airline and navy said the plane landed in the lagoon after failing to reach the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
"That's an extremely good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that through the water that had reached the waist level, he and other people managed to achieve the emergency exits of the aircraft.
He said the stewardess were panicking and were shouting, while he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working on the repair of a nearby pier helped save them, using an airboat to transport people ashore before the aircraft dived into about 30 metres (100 feet) under water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate 111 people have lost their lives in airline collisions recorded at PNG in the last two decades, but âºAir Niugini" was not involved in any of them.
The analyst builds the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday the prosecution presented her arguments in the retrial of a person who is accused of burning a woman alive from Mississippi in 2014.
American Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours, in the quality of the expert in the field of data analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used phone records to rebuild the movements of the defendant, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and of the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night that this latter passed away.
According to reports by The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett stated that he has taken the location data from several cell phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the afternoon of her death, fact which refutes his earlier claims.
When the records revealed that his cell phone was in the same place as that of Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, then the police went to talk to the latter.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that that that day he was not in the city.
When asked by prosecutors whether Tellis was telling the truth when he stated that that that evening he was in Sanford's truck, the latter said that "he is lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies is Tellis's statement, which said he had recognized Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Phone tables showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted messages, calls and contact records from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Hale said.
The defensive side is projected to provide closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge stated that the jury would make the decision that same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A three-member hip hop group seeks to challenge the negative views of this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claim that hip hop has departed from his origins of political messages and of messages dealing with social issues.
They want to return to origin and make it re-recognizable hip hop.
In the UK, a re-emergence of artists such as The Fugees and Commons has been noted in contrast to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another man of color?!
The nanny from New York sues the couple for leaving work after receiving the message "racist"
A New-Jork nanny has sued a couple for discrimination in firing, as he has received a message mistakenly sent by a mother who complains that she was "another man of color."
The couple have denied that they are racist, viewing the lawsuit as "snapping."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her concern when she discovered that young nanny Giselle Maurice, was a colored woman, the moment she appeared on her first day of work, in 2016.
"JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, A MAN WITH A MAN," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in the message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing its gaffe, Plasco-Flaxman, "feeled in embarrassment", fired Mrs. Maurice, on reasoning that their current nanny, who was African-American, had done a poor job and that instead, she wished for a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her single day of work and then sent home with a "capture in her pocket".
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for being fired, and is seeking compensation at the cost of $350 a day for a six-month period, for which she had been hired, though without contract.
"I want to show them that they shouldn't do such things," she stated Friday for The Post, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have denied claims that they are racist, saying Maurice's departure was the right action, as they feared they could no longer trust him after having offended him.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racist," the husband Joel Plasco for The Post.
"But would you leave the children in the hands of a person to whom you have been rude, though mistaken?
Your newborn baby?
Tell me."
Considering the lawsuit as "sumper," Plasco said he and his wife had brought a child to life, two months earlier and were in a "very difficult situation."
"Can you avenge anyone in this situation?
It's not something positive to do," Plasco, investment banker added.
While the case has gone to court, public opinion has quickly denounced the couple in social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter shows that Paddington publishers feared that readers would not establish links with a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book's acceptance, said about this letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of a person who reads it for the first time before it was published.
We feel a great satisfaction now that we have seen Paddington's extraordinary success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before being inspired by a little toy bear to write the book for children, would have been saddened if his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication, last year after his death, contained "suffer and happiness".
As far as Paddington is concerned, which she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of success.
"He was a quiet person and did not boast," she said.
"Paddington was so real to him that it was the same as having a child who succeeds: you feel proud of him even though it's not exactly your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always credited Paddington's own character."
My daughter was changing her life and I was forced to say goodbye by phone.
Upon arrival, her daughter was urgently taken to the Louis Pastur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors had tried to save her life but without result.
"Nad regularly phoned me to tell me that it was too heavy, which he didn't believe would succeed," said Mrs. Edna-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad who told me that she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Now, I love you so much, baby.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
Medications given to her doctors to keep her heart at work were slowly losing the effect and leaving her system.
She had died some time before and now everything was "fixing".
I was forced to sit and wait, knowing this was happening.
I could not mourn or yell because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to be strong."
In time Mrs. Edna-Laperouse, mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane along with other passengersâwho were unaware of what she was experiencing.
"No one knew," she said.
"I kept my head down and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during that flight I felt a great pity for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Black females post papers to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide are working to prevent others from suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted letters of inspiring messages, on a bridge in Wales as well as phone numbers of persons who can call for support.
Mrs. Davis's son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want no parent feeling the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, with residency in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a "sticky" smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
People always said that his smile shines every room."
However, he gave up his job before changing his life, as he was located "at a truly dark moment."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was the person who found his brother after he had committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly worried that there will be a domino effect."
Mrs. Davis created the papers, so people can know that there are people who can help them and who they can talk to, even with a friend.
Don't sit in solitary - you have to talk."
Ms. Humphreys, who has been Mrs. Davies' friend for many years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt upset, depressed or anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed the change in behavior.
He was extremely upset on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts, he did not look them in the eye and did not do any action."
She said his death was a major trauma to them, but that they should overcome: "It's something that destroys the whole family.
We destroyed us.
But, we must all move forward and fight."

Brett's future Kavanaugh hangs on the thread after the FBI's investigation starts
"I thought that if we could give him something similar to what he was looking for - a limited time and object investigation - maybe we could bring some harmony," said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee was "dissolved" amid numerous opposition obstacles.
Why didn't Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Their hesitation comes all the way to time.
Congress election is only 5 weeks away, on November 6 - if Republicans go poorly, as it is expected, they will be greatly weakened in efforts to select the person they want in the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has called the senators, lobbying for them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
It will be voted in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently located.
It is not yet clear if Mr. Kavanaugh can garner at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to end this situation and confirm in the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea fell under Kim's leadership
The number of defectors in North Korea has declined since Kim Jong came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has stated.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Union Ministry in South Korea, has stated there were about 1127 defections last year - compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the main factors were the strictest controls on the borders between North Korea and China, as well as the highest tariffs required by human trafficking.
Penonin has not made public comments.
Most deserters from North Korea receive citizenship from South Korea.
Seoul has stated that more than 30,000 people from North Korea have illegally crossed the border since the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most leave towards China, which has the largest border length with North Korea and there can be passed more simply compared to the DMZ (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is protected by multiple forces.
China considers deserters illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the two countries' leaders met in Penian and their talks focused on delayed negotiations for denuclearisation.
This meeting came after the historic meeting of June, between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore, where they agreed, in general terms, to work for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But, on Saturday, North Korea Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress until that moment.
"Without having confidence in the US, there will be no faith in our national security, and in these circumstances, there is no chance that we, one-sidedly, will be disarmed first," Mr. Ri said during a speech at the UN General Assembly, in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histeric," and says he is not worthy to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, named the High Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh "histrik" and stated that because of his temperament, he was unable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelos made these comments on Saturday, during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival, in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help thinking that if a woman had ever behaved like that, people would say 'histerical,'" Pelos said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh flatly denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his presentation speech, Kavanaugh was very concerned and at some moments almost shouted or "sucked up" when talking about his family and his high school years.
He accused the Democrats expressly in front of the committee, calling the charges against him as "a grotesque and coordinated assassination to his image", organised by liberals angry by the loss of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi expressed her opinion that Kavanaugh's testimony constituted evidence that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as she showed his prejudice to the Democrats.
"I think he criminalized himself with those statements and with the way he attacked Clintons and Democrats", she said.
Pelosi hesitated to answer the question of whether to try to give Kavanaugh a no-confidence motion in case of his appointment, and in the event that Democrats win most of the seats in the House of Representatives.
"Let me tell you -- if he's not telling the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he's unalterable not only to the Supreme Court, but also to the court where he is now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently the judge at the Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelos added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decisions against the Law on Sustainable Care or on the Roe case against Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In hearings for his appointment, Kavanaugh evaded questions about whether he would abolish certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical and biased person to become a member of the court and wait for us to say "o how good!", Pelos said.
And women should exploit it.
This is a straight verbal attack, months and years of anger breaking out, and it can't get to the bottom without crying.
"We cry when we get angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual.
She went on to, "A woman who worked in a leadership position, who said that she too cried when she was angry, but had devised a style that whenever she would get angry and start crying, said to the interlocutor, "You might think I'm upset and that's why I'm crying.
But I'm actually angry."
And then she kept talking.
And I thought this was a brilliant idea."
Tears are a way of expressing anger, in part because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of an old job, in an office where I found myself weeping at some point from overwhelming anger, was the moment when a bigger woman grabbed me for my throat - a cold manager who I've always been somewhat afraid - and pushed me toward the stairs.
"Never let others see you crying", she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're upset and they'll be glad they managed to upset you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of Congress from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his candidacy for President.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was found in the midst of an extramarital affair aboard a boat named "Monkey Business" and put out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder, extremely angry, realized there was no reason not to think of running for president himself.
"This wasn't a well-capped decision", she told me laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone called it "The Bearbards and the Seven dwarves".
Since the campaign was in its final stages, she had been left behind with the fund collection, so she vowed that she would not compete if she failed to raise $2 million.
But it was a futile fight.
She found that some of her supporters who gave her $100 men, she was given $25,000.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.
During the speech where she announced that she would not carry out an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotionâgratitude for people who supported her, anger with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger with sexismâthat she drowned.
"It looked as if I had suffered a nervous breakdown", recalled Mrs. Schroeder regarding the way the press reacted to her.
"It looked like Cleenex was my sponsoring corporation.
I remember thinking about what people would write on my tombstone?
"She cried"?".
U.S.-Chinese trade war advantages for Beijing
The first commercial war turtles between the U.S. and China were shocking, and as the war is far from over, a division between the two countries could pose an advantage for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year, setting taxes on leading Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation was what happened this week, when the new tariffs affected goods worth $200 billion ($15 billion), effectively taxing half the goods entering the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated every time "in nature", finally setting tariffs of five to ten percent over US$60 billion in goods.
China has pledged to repay the U.S. with the same currency, and the second largest economic power in the world is unlikely to surrender soon.
The removal of the measures from Washington means surrendering in the face of their demands, but for China's President Xi Jinping, it would be too shameful to publicly bow before the U.S..
However, experts said that if China plays its papers properly, the pressures coming from the trade war with the US can positively support China in long term, to decrease the interdependence of these two economies.
"The fact that political decisions, taken rapidly in both Washington and Beijing, can cause economic decline in each of these countries, is something far more dangerous than what has been seen from the outside," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher at the research center for the new American security, which focuses on the Asian continent.
Syria is 'ready' for refugee returns, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moalem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists, to restore normality.
Already, there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to their country, from where they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that struck their daily lives and their well-being.
The UN estimates that about 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war, in 2011.
About six million others still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mowalem said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance to rebuild the destroyed state.
But he stressed that the country would not accept assistance or conditional assistance from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe wins "Ryder Cup Trophy", in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup 2018 trophy after defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 by 10.5, at Le Golf National, on the exit of Paris, France.
The US has already lost 6 consecutive games on European territory and has since 1993 won this trophy in Europe.
Europe recovered the crown after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team, managed to get the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who was the player who faced the most difficulty during the tournament, took the first blow to the water and closed the 16th pit with 3 shots more than the fixed level, losing the match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, excelled in all his rounds, becoming 1 of 4 players who have achieved the score 5-0-0, since the actual format began to apply, in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
Player number one in the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played in his final of Ryder Cup.
The Spanish veteran, Sergio Garcia, who has played in eight Ryder Cup, became the most successful European player of all time in this tournament, with 25.5 points in career.
"Exactly, I don't cry but today I can't support myself.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy we recovered the cup.
The success is of the team, and I'm happy I had the opportunity to help them," Garcia said quite excited after the European team win.
He passed the word to his fellow countrymen, John Ram, who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods, in direct challenges, on Sunday.
"I feel an extraordinary pride that I defeated Tiger Woods. I grew up watching that player," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all of his matches in France and now has statistics 13-21-3, during his career in Ryder Cup.
A bizarre statistic by one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles, ranking second behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team faced difficulties throughout the weekend to take the ball to the right spot, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf along the entire tour.
The U.S. captain, Jim Furyk, spoke after his team's disappointing appearance, "I'm proud of these guys.
There were moments during this morning when we put pressure on the European team.
We fought hard.
Thomas' congratulations.
He's an excellent captain.
His 12th players played quite well.
We'll regroup, work with the PGA in America as well as with our Ryder Cup committee and move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be the captain.
We need to "releas the hat".
They played better than us."
