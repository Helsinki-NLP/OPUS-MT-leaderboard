Crying to the World
The Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign seems to have gone well and shouts and calls out in nature have begun to pull people wide and wide around the world.
“Your own colloquium, I need Iceland,” said one woman in the big world in commenting on an advertisement from the marketing campaign Hooks Like You Need Iceland on YouTube topic.
Another observer will keep Iceland in her heart for all eternity, and a young woman says she must go as soon as she gets to Iceland at the end of her fiance there.
Sadly, however, it is in the United States for a few months to come.
Another observer asks if the walk to Iceland is good, for there are no planes.
It doesn't follow the story of whether it comes from another time zone.
Eric Thorðurderson of the Public Advertising Office, which was published in conjunction with the International Advertising Office M&C Saatchi, says that they have been given more hope.
“I came to many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well, but this new campaign is already starting to strike.
In essence, this is about creating PR values, it's getting foreign media to talk about the campaign, and it's gone incredibly well.
In a relatively short period of time, we have received a discussion of some seven hundred media throughout the world, involving over two billion people.
The value of this consideration is valued at $1.8 billion.
It's not a bitch."
The main market is the United States, and the campaign has gone well, even though the Americans are not on their way to the country for a while.
According to Egil, the market area, such as Denmark, Britain, and Germany, has also been well - known, like Russia, as a pleasant surprise.
In this case, foreign areas, such as India, had a reaction that was not specifically associated with them.
“ These ads have traveled far beyond our expectations, ” says Eric, who may have seen more than four million people watching YouTube.
"We couldn't have wished for a better start."
The photos here on the open took the Foaming newspaper of Årnni Sæberg, the photographer of the morning newspaper, to the advertising campaign that carries the superscription “Let It Out” in the middle of the last month.
The school - guarded trails in Reykjavík, Reynis Fjord, at Skogarfos, on the Solomon River, and in a cave at Hjorifässäki.
The director was Samuel Bjarki Petersson and Gunnar Paul Olafsson at Skoti productions and taken over the Son of God.
The Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, from Cuba and Hungary, played roles in the field.
The Tugs of Iceland came to the advertising work, but at the same time as the recordings took place in South Africa, there was another group in West and West.
According to Egil, "Let It Out" is only the first member of the Hooks Like You Need the Iceland campaign, but it is aimed at a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
“ It’s just the first phase of this work for Iceland’s Office, ” says Eric, adding that the cooperation with M&C Saatchi was very successful.
“ It’s great to work with them.
In such tasks, it is important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the range we are talking to."
Explosives: Manage the situation on the labour market, pension funds, and much more
Mr. Einar Dateson's Minister for Social Affairs and the Childhood, is attending Sprengisand, which begins at 10 a.m. today.
He is also the Minister for Labour and discusses the situation in the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and more issues.
He also discusses rural issues and transport work in a land that has been badly involved and has been debated over the past few years and decades.
Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, Chairman of VR, will also be involved, but he will discuss his criticisms about investment in bio-energy and put forward ideas that labor movement and employers will withdraw from the government of the fund to reduce the risk of conflict of interest.
Then we will discuss with them Ivar Ingimarsson, a traveling servant in Austria, and Árnhei Johnannsdóttir, the manager of the Norwegian market, about the position of travel services in the countryside.
They will look forward to the fall and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading command of what to come.
The part below can be listened to, starting at 10 a.m.
That's how she looks today 25 years later
The actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in all aspects of his teens.
However, she was famous for her game as Amber in Cleeless, 25 years ago.
Then she also played in the parts of Sabrina: The Teenage Witch along with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years of age, married to one child.
Although she has recently been exposed, she was moved to look over the road and to communicate with Clueless on loving television during the days.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy, who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she's been a great person.
“ I have to admit that I based the person most on the girls I met in school that wasn’t good with me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who that person was," said Donovan about his game in Cleeless.
Didn't want to leave the police station after a night shower.
About fifty cases came to the police in the capital area today, and the police journal says that the cases were varied.
The day at the police station on the street of Evfisgáda began with a policeman having had to trade a man who had then recently been released from a prison cell after staying there for drunk driving.
Did not want to go away after he was released and did not obey police orders that told him to go away.
The man continued to stay at the police station because of his progress.
Then a man was arrested this morning suspected of breaking into a company in Kopavogi.
Police also had to deal with two men in Breholti because of a body attack report.
Then, too, a woman who was working at a shopping center in Copavogi could not pay for the bill after a meal and was therefore called to the police.
Stolls were also reported on the car in the city centre this morning.
The driver of the white Renault van looked at her for a moment and was then taken out of his hand.
The car hasn't been found.
Curse of the Glorious Fate - The Horrible Fate of the Glee Star
The theory has reached a flight on the Internet to curse the series of events around the Gleeds, while the actress Naya Rivera drowned in California during the days, thereby becoming the third major player of the program to give life far ahead of time.
The events of the Glee are a popular series of songs, dance, and joy.
They covered the so - called high - school gladiator, their love, and their fate.
While not always being in the gladry was taken out, singing and dancing seemed to overwhelm each situation that arose in their lives.
However, outside the scenes, great disaster has been taking place over actors and team members, so much that theories have awakened that a curse rests on the scenes.
Naya Marie Rivera took the role of Santana Lopez in the scenes, a cheerleader who didn't call all her grandmother.
After the series had run its course, Rivera went to have the actor Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently understood them.
Dorsey, however, refused to file a complaint, and the domestic violence was dropped.
On July 8, last year, Rivera was reported to be missing after her four - year - old son felt alone in a boat on Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found sleeping in a lifejacket on board the boat and was able to report to the police the fact that he and his mother had been stuck to the alley and then Rivera had returned to the boat and never returned to the boat.
Extensive search for Rivera was carried out.
The day after the search began, the police chief in the area reported that we were looking for was assumed to have drowned Rivera.
Five days later Rivera was found and was officially declared dead.
It is believed that it was in heavy water currents and a new last requirement in saving the son.
Cause of death was reported drunk by accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the show, the American football player with the angelic voice, who played a key role in bringing the Gleeds to victory and respect.
On the outside, though, Moneith faced personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had been struggling with addiction and found it difficult to get away from it.
In 2013, his associates felt that they had had enough to do so, intervened, and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went to treatment and seemed everything looked to a better road.
Only two months after he finished treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have a good time with friends.
Banamein was a fatal mixture of drugs and alcohol.
It was not thought that there was an act of will.
Moneith had been treated and his tolerance to overdosage had been reduced so much that the dose he had previously tolerated was fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was heavy on his fellow workers, but on the basis of his mother - in - law, Leah Michele, was determined to continue taking part and dedicated them to the memory of Moneith and his person Finns.
Mark Wayne Salling took the role of Noah “Puck” Puckerman in the scenes, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the Glides, or all until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles suspected of child pornography.
At his home search, a huge amount of child pornography was found, and the matter soon came out publicly.
Clearly, Salling had finished.
After that, he was charged and convicted of his transgressions.
He ate four - to - seven - year - old prison, as well as what he would have to be on a record of sex criminals and seek treatment for child - abuse.
Before the penalty was decided by the judge, Salling, who was then free from insurance, was found dead near his home.
Death was suicide.
It was not just the actors who fell from far beyond their age.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
In 2013, only 41 years of age did he fall asleep.
The show also worked for a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was a younger sister, a great star of Julia Roberts, who did not carry her sister’s beautiful story, but she accused Robert of much government and disrespectful behavior.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she had severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiancee, saying to her mother and sister that includes responsibility for her situation.
“My mother and so-called siblings will have nothing left me, except the memory that they were the ones that caused my worst depression.”
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of using her fellows alone and overpassing at the scene and of having an extraordinarily astrologer.
Jesse Luke took a guest role in the 2012 show.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was a major scandal.
The actress Heather Morris played a major role in the show.
In 2010, she experienced the arrival of unspoiled computer slaves in nude photos of them and the publication on the Internet.
The actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner played both in the show and had an extra - factor relationship.
Benoist later reported that Jenner was violent in her relationship.
You can put flowers on almost everything.
It increases the development of children when they are allowed to play in the garden with their parents to grow flowers and to watch them grow and grow.
With flowers one Swedish photographer Anna Kubel can also be done forever.
Just having time with the children in the garden is something that never forgets.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance, and, of course, the precious time they received with their parents.
Acquiring a boat after 10th grade
“I don’t think we’re many sailors working in theater schools of the country,” says Axel Eagle Gudmundsson, who is fishing in the summer but studying psychology at the University of Iceland over the winter.
Coastal fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you are studying.
If fish are fished, you can have a good income, and I think it’s great not to take a study loan.
They also do well into the winter," said Axel Eagle Gudmundsson, 25 years of psychology, who is fishing for beaches in summer, as in the past some.
Axel was recently laid down at Tálknafred when a journalist reached his speech late in the evening at the beginning of the week."
“ The way I was in my tenth grade, I took ship’s board rights for boats less than 12 feet [12 m] long, and I bought my boat the summer after finishing my primary school.
I've been fishing my boat all summer since.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartmann the son of Jon, and I called the boat his name.
When I bought the boat, Hartmann had grown up and stopped being at sea, and he was very happy when he saw that the boat had his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat," Axel says, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
“ I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of summer, and the other half at the end of summer, when I had already fished.
So I had the boat at the end of my first summer on it."
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay off when he had just finished primary school?
“ I had set up and collected money, I had been working with my dad to sea when I was a boy, I was all some of them hunting with him, and I got my share.
I also put my money in my boat register."
Axel was born in the land of Isafird, from where all his mother's people are; but he has lived in Copavogi since he was a boy.
“ I can hunt here in the west because I have a legal home with my grandmother in Isafird.
I learned in these areas here west of rowing with my dad.
I'm moving between four and four, depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers the entire West Side.
Although I feel the best way to be west, I have also provided around Snæfellsnest and elsewhere.
I've also provided for the south, but I'd rather be a crayon," said Axel, who always robs one flame in the morning and says, sometimes speaking to the guerrillas and singing to the sky, in the sole Being for hours out in the prom.
“ The Internet on the sea is good, so I can call, listen to TV programs and music.
I don't think it's a problem to be alone.
Of course I try to avoid falling into danger, but certainly occasionally something has been happening to the weather, but never much danger," said Axel, who is lucky that he is never seasick.
He says that the length of the working day depends on how the hunts work each time.
“ I’ve never been hunting for more than 14 hours at a time at sea, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rent, but then I’ve been constantly for a day and a half to feed at sea. ”
The sea - hunting arrangement says that it may catch about seven hundred and a half pounds [770 kg] a day, which it considers to be a hammer.
“ Other restrictions are that I may not hunt Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and I may only hunt twelve days a month, during the four months of beach fishing, in May, June, July, and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their hunting days by weather and nothing else.
Instead of having 48 days over the whole summer, this unnecessary pressure can be calmed and chosen.
So the regional division could also go for me, and the sea lock that is well located with the fisher should enjoy it," said Axel, who draws the most powerful cod out of the salty sea of his beach fishing, but also only the wolf and some other species flow with.
Axel works during the winter with the college at Nupi, Kopavogi.
“ I don’t think we’re many sailors working in the play schools of the country, ” Axel proudly says, adding that he only meant to work temporarily at the play school.
“ I got stuck there because I think this is a great job.
I hope that the psychology study will take advantage of me at the final stage," says Axel, who has also been studying in business.
An error in registration prevented a return target
An error in a registration form that people fill out when they arrive in the country resulted in a person living here not being called back for a sample.
The registration number is not required if the person concerned fills out the form in English, as it is when it is done in Icelandic.
“ This will be checked this week, ” says a specialist in a terrestrial health care centre.
Three inland infections were detected in the National Hospital virus division yesterday.
One who proved to be positive came to the country on July 15, two days after the so - called “rescue ” rules came into effect.
The residents of Iceland are then screened at arrival in the country and again announced in a sample four to five days later.
RUV’s lunch news showed that, however, the old system had been applied.
The sample on the border was negative and was not recalled in screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rutt Sigfusdóttir, a specialist in the terrestrial disease area, says in a discussion with a news office that this may be a mistake in the electronic registration form.
If people fill out the English registration form, they are not required to insert an English identification number as it is in the Icelandic version.
In the first place, it was thought of by foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person has not received an automatic call for a sample.
Kamilla says, however, that many have followed the rules on return migration, although they have filled the registration form in English, and in some cases employers have also been alert to send people back to the sample after they arrived in the country.
“ This will be checked during the week how it can be made easier for people to have access to it, to draw their attention to it in the process. ”
The man is in isolation, and six have been put in quarantine.
They're all going to a sample, but two of them were starting to show symptoms.
Stimulation is now in progress with the three infections diagnosed yesterday, which are mostly due to two of the infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, the serial analysis of the Icelandic genetic analysis has revealed that there are variants of the chorus virus that have not been previously identified.
In the second case, the bond has focused on Israel, although it is known that the person who had moved the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be tomorrow where the other virus would be coming from.
A total of 15 are now isolated according to the COVID.
135 are sick.
Four out of five free infections
Five domestic infestations have been identified here in the past days.
Of these, the four alphas are unconnected and are not to form the source of the infection that came up at the Rey Cup Sports Day yesterday.
Smuggling is still ongoing.
Originally, in the third decade of our Common Era, a reduction in the number of children was made to sixteen.
All in all, 34 of these new infections were diagnosed yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period of time when sports events are diagnosed, and it has raised questions as to whether such events should be maintained.
John K. Joannsson, director of the Public Protection Department, says this very slowly, as long as people follow standards and rules.
“ We are constantly making it clear to all those living here that personal protection is necessary.
We also need to make it clear to people who are handling events that there are certain rules that need to be applied.
Then an event can be held," says John.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by maintaining individual protection.
In addition, rules and criteria are subject to constant review.
“ What needs to be done, and what is constantly being stressed by the public protection department and the terrestrial medicine department, is to be aware of these individual infectious diseases.
Both at home and also at service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
This will prevent the transmission of infectious diseases," says John.
“We need to urge people to continue on the good road we were on, in order to maintain the results we have so far. ”
40% of victims COVID-19 had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the go - on phone how difficult her father had to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes, and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day, he was dead.
The death was attributed to sudden breathing problems due to coronary virus infection.
Diabetes mellitus was identified on the death certificate as a underlying problem, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that the same will happen.
The Reuter Newskeeper says the fear of Brumfield isn't for nothing.
A recent study conducted by the U.S. government shows that less than 40% of those who were killed with diabetes 2 as the underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached 65 years of age is considered, the ratio increases to half.
The U.S. CDC study included more than 10,000 people in 15 countries who died from the crown virus during the period from February to May.
Jonathan Wortham, a CDC infectious expert, says the results are striking, especially for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
The slow growth of Reuters was hidden and pointed out the answers from the 12 countries that corresponded to comparable proportions.
10 countries, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet reported underlying diseases.
“ Diabetes was already an epidemic of slow growth.
Now COVID—19 has broken through like a powerful age," has Reuters, by Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at Chicago University.
Diabetes mellitus is more common among black and people of South American origin, who have also gone out of the crown virus.
One of the best ways to protect those with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease in check with exercise, good diet and healthcare professionals.
On the other hand, the Korean virus epidemic has made it difficult for many to keep a bus.
In this way, insulin has been high in some people to keep on attending work and thus risk being exposed to the virus.
Reuters points out that the U.S. authorities could have been aware of the risks that those with diabetes 2 might have caused by the virus.
When SARS crown virus passed in 2003, over 20% of them had the disease, and in 2009 this group was at three times more likely to have to be hospitalized.
In 2012, a single study showed that 60% of those who died or were involved in ICU had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because the influence of the COVID-19 virus could have taken away the cover of many previously unknown complications.
“ I fear we will see a flood wave of problems when this is over, ” says Andrew Bolton, president of the international diabetes organization.
Physicians have warned that the coronary epidemic may lead indirectly to an increase in diabetic complications, including kidney disease and renal dialysis.
Similarly, new studies suggest that chorus virus may lead to an increase in diabetes mellitus.
Reuters says that scientists are trying to understand the relationship between the coronary virus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs, and kidneys, organs that are already ill in many people with diabetes.
Then a high proportion of glucose and lipids in diabetic patients can produce a truly called “cell - signalling storm, ” as it is called when the immune system responds too hard and attacks the body.
Impaired endothelial cells can also lead to inflammation, which can in turn cause fatal blood clots.
“ It’s all one big puzzle, ” Dela Cruz says.
"It's all connected to internality."
The report has been corrected.
"We were invited to champagne, so they left the room"
Azarun Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason had the unusual request from the artist Ragnar Gargamer’s son to have sex in front of a camera for works that the artist was setting up in Paris.
“We loved each other so it wasn’t complicated. ”
So atli Bollason never forgets when he first met his wife and grandmother, Asrunnu Magnúsdóttir.
“ I became very impressed with her.
It was, of course, just the radiation, but then she also thought I was very unheard of.
And I'm still looking," he says.
Asrún remembers this too, the husband remembers the first meeting regularly.
“ I’m always hearing this story.
The last weekend," she says, who was also attracted to her husband at first appearance.
“ I felt so excited about Atla, whom I love.
There's a lot going on and a lot going on and I was impressed."
Atli says that she and her husband have stressed the importance of going their own way.
“ We don’t tie up the same knots as our travelers.
We avoid the rutine that we're separating around us."
This may be why they took the background of Ragnar Gargamer’s son, an artist, just as it would be most unusual.
“Christine Anna, our mutual friend, is in touch with us and asks if we can come to eat Desert with him, Ragga and Ragnar’s Ingi rescue wife, on Snaps. ”
They accepted the invitation, met the trio at Snaps, and had a desert wine and each dessert.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans for an art show that he thought would set up in Palais de Tokyo, Paris, in the fall of the fall.
“ He had a multi-channel omnipotent work called Scenes from Western culture.
He described it in a simple way."
Asrún says that he described the work as a death and a decade of everyday life in Western lands.
“ He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot, and lastly he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in. ”
Since Ragnar asked the couple to participate, she was to show a young middle class to love in a minimal room.
“ These are beginning and ending intercourse, ” says Atli.
The couple did not know much, although they knew about him and of them, “but they knew us and felt fit for this.
They had words that they did not want to advertise people.
Perhaps they thought that they would not get the right people, but people who would get sexual exaggeration from working for others."
They asked Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it did not take long.
“ When we got out of Snaps, we said, ‘ Aren’t we just ready to do this?
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and his entire team," says Ásrún and Atli.
"It's about love and neighbor"
Senan was taken to a nice apartment on the Myrjar Street.
There was a very rare film studio; a cameraman, Ragnar, and a musician, and the couple.
After the recording had been turned on, everyone left the room to wait in the car except Atli and Ásrún.
“ We hadn’t decided how we should be.
We received some guidance, but we tried to forget a moment and a place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
There was no game, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Ásrún.
But was it romantic?
“ Yes, it was a bit romantic, ” says Atli and Ásrún.
“ We were invited to champagne before they left the room.
It was a bit like being on vacation at a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was pleased with the performance of the couple in the work that moved them.
“ When Tommi the camera watched this, he wept, and it was so beautiful to him, ” says Atli.
“ It’s as much about love as about closeness as it is about company itself, ” says Ásrún.
The couple’s parents have seen the work, and they tell Atli that his mother heard the voice in the son of the Museum of Reykjavik and then realized that he was part of the work.
“ Then she turns around and starts to plow in it, ” says Atli.
“ Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anybody this way, but then my dad just sends me a message and says, "I'm happy to crash the little family in Palais de Tokyo," said Ásrún.
And I wonder if the part in the project had deepened the relationship between Ashur and Atla.
“ At least we’re still together, so maybe this was a bit deeper.
This at least deepened my relationship with my family-related family," says Ásrún and laugh.
Ásrún himself saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
“ I found it hard not to be with you, but with someone else, ” she says, turning to her husband.
“ But it was nice to see this, because it’s just one late in a much bigger job, and when you saw it with the other effects, it’s really cool.
I could get a little bit out of this, and I was just proud.
And there was that little bean in my stomach," says Ásrún, who was pregnant by one of the couple's children when the tendon was taken up.
"It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Asruna and Atla in Love stories at Rás 1.
Swansea with victory at the first of the last game
Swansea won a 10-0 win at Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game of the team in the early stages of the game to get into the English select section.
The game took place in Swansea, Wales.
The situation in half was 0-0.
In Swansea’s homes got hell in a minute of 64 minutes, while Andre Ayew failed the archalistine from the point of view and had it protected.
Only two minutes later, Rico Henry, a player of Brentford, received the red card.
So Brentford played the rest of the game less and in an 82nd minute, Swansea’s players took advantage of it.
Andre Ayew added up the vite cloth by marking a great goal and assured Swansea a 10-0 win.
Swansea then leads 1-0 in the one-heavy, but the second game will take place on the next Wednesday at Brentford's home.
For five years since 2009 without a ambassador
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador in Iceland, is in the media flashlight after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard where he feared his life.
However, it has not been difficult for the President of the United States to appoint ambassadors in this country.
Since Carol Van Voorst left the ambassador of the United States at the end of April 2009, all has been ambassadorless on the land for 62 months, over five years.
Van Voorst left office under strange circumstances, but Castlight reported in 2009 that she should have received the Palka word.
On her way to a social meeting with the president of Iceland, she received a telephone call from the president’s office that she would not be honored.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she taught international relations with Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst’s successor came into service, in September 2010.
In some respects, Robert S. Connan may have been appointed ambassador, but he may have stopped.
Finally, Loius Ariega had served in the foreign ministry for decades.
He then left office in the fall of 2013 and took office as ambassador in Guatemala.
Then another ambassador’s period took place.
Robert Barber accepted U.S. Congress in January 2015 and came to work shortly after, but then no ambassador had been there for 13 months.
Barber was political, not diplomatic, but had served as a lawyer and supported Barack Obama’s campaign.
He left office as soon as Donald Trump took over the Presidential Assembly on January 20, 2017, as the custom of a political ambassador.
Trump’s government was unusually long to appoint both ambassadors and senior officials of the Washington government.
Two years passed before the U.S. Council, Jeffrey Ross Gunter announced his meeting to ask him the questions and finally confirm that he was the ambassador in Iceland.
In his witness during the assembly he said he never came to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who was dead, had been of Dutch rock broken.
Gunter is politically appointed, formerly a dermatologist in California, and has been prominent in the Republican Jewish Coalition organization.
The playwright named Sheldon Adelson set up an organization, but Adelson is the keen supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but then no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest example in this country.
The reason is both the length of time for Trump’s government to appoint people as a key office, and the length of time for the past year for the United States has been very slow, including the confirmation of the ambassador’s office.
As a result, since 2009, it has been a full - time ambassador in Iceland for over five years.
However, this has not prevented the activities of the embassy, which opened a recent headquarters at Engatteig.
The executions are considered to have cost about 6.5 billion, while the safety walls surround the building and bulletproof glass are in all windows.
However, it does not seem sufficient to fill the current ambassador’s sense of security because he is said to be afraid of his life and has wished for an armed bodyguard.
A former IBV player suffered racism in Iceland, “It was a mistake to come to Iceland”
Tonny Mawejje, former IBV player, claims to have suffered racism when he was in Iceland and regrets having come to the country.
This is shown in an interview with Tonny, which appears on the Bulgarian Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Ugandan Police FC team in Uganda’s top department.
During the interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny discusses many things, including his time in this country, but he played with IBV, Val, and Evolution in Iceland.
“ When I arrived in Iceland, I did not play in the middle as usual.
The head of the team was in that position, but in addition he also had the order number that I wanted so I didn't get either of what I wanted," said Tonny, but he played on the right edge of the playtime with IBV.
Among Tonny’s discussions is racism, which he suffered in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
“ This once happened to me, but since I did not understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later, I heard about the matter, and then I asked my friend what the matter was all about.
He told me then that my opponent dropped down on me after I seduced him."
In 2014, Tonny went from Iceland to Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
There he says he made the most of his mistakes.
Tonny had not reached the beginning of the Haugesund team, but he wanted to play more to get to the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland for a loan, but he joined Val.
“ It was a mistake to get back to Iceland.
I think if I had been in Norway longer, I would have had the opportunity I wanted," said Tonny, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway he would probably get further.
He claims that the loan to Iceland has caused his dreams of getting to the big crowd in Europe.
Find worms in the neck of a woman
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found 3.8-inch black worms in a woman's neck that was looking for.
The doctor was able to pull the worm out with a pliers.
A study revealed that parasites were present.
CNN's reporting.
The woman had eaten a sashimi a few days earlier, which is the flesh of her flesh.
The woman soon improved after the worm was removed, but such parasites are often in raw meat or fish.
After sushi moved to bed in the West, cases of parasites in people have increased, according to CNN.
Fear of starting another wave in Europe
Spain is now in the midst of concern about the second wave of the coronary virus in Europe, where governments have taken action to re-initiate the spread of the coronary epidemic.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where the number of infections is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action on the rise of infectious diseases in Spain, but in the United Kingdom all have to go to prison for the return from Spain, as in Norway, and the French have been warned of travels to Spain.
In France and Germany, infections are increasing again, where governments try to find a balance in preventing virus spread and restoring economic life.
However, the situation in Europe is good compared to other parts of the world, but the incidence of global infections is almost 300,000 a day, most of which is infected in America and South Asia.
According to John Hopkins University, confirmed transmission of infection has reached 16 million worldwide, with deaths confirmed to be related to the virus reaching 644 thousand.
Mosquical works are finally able to enjoy themselves fully
In front of the Toll house in Reykjavik is a deep and large hole.
Its tops contain orange helmets.
There's also a large grave.
And more of my machines.
The street is closed for traffic.
But the sidewalk is capable, and there many now pause and respect the art of millions of mossic chips — as they have never seen before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least it did not respect it.
The job has so far been somewhat hidden, directly in front of it was a parking lot that was always occupied.
People laid there, locked the car in a rush, and then jumped off to do their business in the center city.
"Various and diverse space of public opinion" and "attractive urban activities" are a guide to the modern - day reconstruction of the Security Guard.
The goal is to make the area beautiful and to allow the Mosaic work of the House of Toll to enjoy a better view.
In front of the job becomes a square, and where the area is well located by the sun, it is considered suitable as a sleeping area for road users.
The work of art will be enlightened and will now be better enjoyed by the material wood than previously on this 142 - square - foot - long surface.
In the area there will also be small “smooth sprayers, ” some sort of water jars that offer a game and give the area a certain disguise.
In this way, the improvements are described by Reykjavík City, which is being carried out along with Vitas.
Water companies, hot water and electric water will be refurbished.
Many of them have come to their own years, but the school laws and the cold water laws have been in service since 1925, so they have served residents and businesses in the city center for less than a century.
Once the street is opened again after completion, cars can drive it again.
Yet, it will be a one - sided gap, and at the same time a quiet and accessible space will be created for walking.
A roman game about Tollhus, on the customs manager’s website, says that the house was used in 1971, whose architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Because of the passage through the house, there were 250 square feet [250 square meters] of unwindowed walls out to the street.
The Building Committee and the architect agreed that such a surface would have a bad effect on the overall street image, if no special arrangements were made to make the house look beautiful.
Hence, members agreed to expect permanent works of art to be set up there.
At that time, a great word of the type of Helgadóttir, an art woman, said in the summary.
Had she worked a lot of musical works in Germany and elsewhere.
The decision was to contact her first before deciding whether the job would be competitive.
Often it had been discussed that the work had to reflect life at the dock, after which the dock had been a life line of Reykjavik since it was made.
When the artist spoke with her, she had to practice such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before she left the country, where she would work on the suggestions abroad.
The time for her to decide was the time, and when she returned home, she made a few suggestions for discussion.
It was agreed without delay to ask her to do the job.
At the same time, it was wanted to make an overall deal with it and the famous art company in Germany, the Brothers Oidtmann, who had long worked with them to set up famous works of art across Europe.
Contracts took place, and Doves performed the work of art in connection with the work of their brothers, who then saw the installation of the house of Toll.
All the work was very well solved, both of the sons of Helgadóttir and of the brothers of Oidt, says in the summary.
Has it ever lasted for an unblemished Icelandic weather?
It took two years to do the work that was done and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after Toll’s work was completed, only 47 years old.
Preparing to move more institutions to the country
Mr. Einar Dadeson's love minister of the Social Affairs Committee announces that more public institutions will be transferred to the country in the near future.
That was the comment of the minister of the program Splengissant at the Belle at noon.
Recently it was reported that in the fall of the House and Civil Society, the firefield will be moved north of the Gulf of Saudi Arabia.
Six fire experts are working at the Agency, none of which are planning to follow the North Office and have been criticising the transport of livestock by the Land of Savage and Medical Carriers.
“ I think we should take further steps into this creature.
I'm preparing further steps for this creature.
"Further transport," said Aronist.
If he is convinced that the vast majority of the people want to see more public institutions around the country.
“I think there is a need to make further political decisions on the transfer of public services to the country, as I was doing with the Department of Housing and Humanity,” said Astrologer, but he also took examples of other agencies that have been moved abroad and had a major impact on the communities in the country, such as the Transport of Food Institutions to Selfoss, Iceland’s National Surveys to Akraness and unemployment insurance on the Skagaststrand.
All the things from the second day of Masteraramoth
In Iceland, Iceland’s 94th Master’s Free Sports Championship ended on the Thorsfield in Akureyri today.
A few conventions were held on the second day of the race.
In 2014, Vigdi Jonsdóttir put Icelandmet in a slant, which stood all the way until Elizabeth Ruth Rúnarsdóttir from the IRI was evaluated in May of last year.
Vigdis won the Icelandic record back earlier this summer and has been in fantasy shape lately, but she has tripled Iceland’s estimate of what is summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been dealing with injury and has not recovered today.
She had only one golden throw of five, cast a 25.69 yards, which is far from her best.
Vigdis threw the longest of all today, or 60,08 feet [60,08 m] in her last attempt and set up an assembly.
Her Icelandic record in July was 62,69 feet [62,69 m] earlier, and she was, however, somewhat different from that.
The second battle of the day was due to Guðrun Karitas Hallgrim’s daughter, who improved her best performance by a throw of 50,18 feet [50,18 m].
In a group of men, F.H.H., Hilmar took Eagle Jonsson, an Iceland Meth in a slant, a safe victory, but he threw 73.84 meters in his next last throw, and set the convention.
His ice cream record in the article is 75.26 meters.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, an Olympicsman, and an Icelandic meter in the roundabout, won a ball - roll competition on the Thorsfield yesterday, but today he competed for the most roundabout, his main article.
The island of Val’s gods is 65,53 meters [65,13 m], but he threw the longest 5,13 meters [59,13 m] today and secured his victory.
The Valdimar Hilti Erlendsson threw a second long throw today, but he had one valid throw that worked in the second seat, 49,43 meters.
Seadi’s daughter, Iceland’s meticulous ocean, won the long - range battle with superiority, but Havdi’s jump was less than 6 feet [6.25 m] today, less than 40 cm [40 cm] away from Iceland’s record.
In the 200-metre race of women, it was the irst man God save Jonathan Bjarnadtóttir, who reached the target in 24,04 seconds, while her Iceland record in the article is 23,45 seconds.
In Akureyri, God - save Jonah was victorious, but she won two gold prizes yesterday, in a 100 - foot race, and in a 4 x 100 - foot race, as well as in a 4 x 400 - foot race today.
In a group of men, Kolbein, Head of Gunnarsson, was the first F.H. to mark the 200 - foot race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds before the Oliver Moon of Samuel’s Year.
Just as God saved Jonah, Sir Sir Kolbein Held took gold in the 100 yards yesterday as well as in the 400 - foot race.
Can't pay for 27 million dollars Bitcoin crop
The Overtax Committee has rejected the obligation of a tax investigator who demanded that a person be guilty of misrepresenting his financial resources due to the sale of the electronic coin Bitcoin.
The committee concluded that a tax investigator had not provided clear evidence of why it was necessary to pay the man a fine.
The committee’s decision states that the tax investigator considered the man to have a position in material misrepresentation due to income years 2016 and 2017.
He would have overrated his financial resources, which would have been made available for the sale of the coin Bitcoin at 27 million, either on purpose or out of a wonderful lack of shepherding.
The guilty man for his conduct.
So the man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
However, in 2016, he managed to sell electronic coins for 27 million.
He would have been buried in 2009 and 2010 when it would have been both easy and unbundled with a regular home computer.
Then he pointed out that when he sold the coins, the tax due to such sales had been significantly unclear and unpredictable.
No doubt public citizens could have been expected to recognize such tax arrangements.
He would not have avoided paying taxes from the harvest and would have recognized his property as an element in a tax account.
He would have asked both experts and the governor about how this was done but without success.
Then he thought that he needed to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began digging for Bitcoin.
Thus, he would have been in a worse position than others to study complex rules that the tax authorities would not have taken a clear view of.
The man rightly considered that his taxes for these two years of income would be rejuvenated and strained, but otherwise no penalty would be made.
Then he insisted that he would work in Iceland and have paid taxes here on land since 2012.
He would never have avoided his duties in an improper way.
The demand for guilt would be out of all measure and would be indebted to him.
He says, "This man understands what football is."
Andersen Willumsson’s wedding dress has been quite a bit between the teeth of people, but it is also a source of excitement because of his progress, which is a time of play with Bilbik in Pepsi Max.
Flashes will be on the fireline tonight when they receive IA in live broadcast at Station 2 Sport.
A wedding boy then takes out a ban because of four reminders of the season and so does not come to play with a new haircut like in summer's games until now.
He had had been written “blah, blah, blah” on his head before the game at HK on the last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
“ I don’t know exactly who he was responding to with the payment, but speaking of character, it was better to try in the game.
He didn't hide.
He wants the ball every time, and if there was someone going to make this game, I thought he would, or he'd make it," said Gudmundur Benediktsson in Pepsi Max's stand, when thought he fought for the wedding.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
“ It’s hard sometimes to figure out where he is.
He's looking a bit out on the left when it starts to pass on the game, but he's got a very free roll in the team," said Hjorvar Hafledason.
Tyrell Måni Petersson, who says Brännjolf a real entertaining force, rejoices to get such a colorful man in the department: “No one cares that this is a character.
It's a fun type and I love it with my hair, and always be ready to show up and answer the interview.
There is an amazing lot of people occupied by him, who tells me that this man understands what football is.
“ I’m an entertainer.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it."
The people are reading the interviews with Brænjelf, people are paying themselves in and watching what's next on his hair.
This man is just a genius," said Måni.
KR player says he wants to leave the club - "I've been in touch with a few people in B."
Tobias Thomsen, player KR in Pepsi Max, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish media Ball, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the matter.
Tobias wants to reach the start of the period in his own country, but he first has to give up his contract with KR where the Danish department begins before the Icelandic likeness.
The company knows I miss Danmerk and have shown a great deal of understanding," said Tobias in a conversation with Bold.
“I’ve been in contact with several B-section teams and will probably switch before the Icelandic season ends.
There aren't many people in Denmark who can afford to pay up my deal at KR."
Then he says that he probably has to take on a wage reduction in Denmark.
"The effects of the virus are likely more likely to be felt by Danish communities than in Iceland."
Half a million wheels have been restored to the heart of the Hortic cross - now answers after the DV coverage
For over a year, Bjartmar Leosson has had different interests.
He cleans up and saves lost and stolen bicycles, bicycles, and wallets.
Bjartmar has earned the name “wheeler” as a matter of fact.
Yesterday, when you published a report on your relationship with Bjartmar, a huge wreck arose.
Did D.V. during discussions on the Facebook group of West Towns, where Bjartmar said that he spoke to the man on East Coast and said that the wallet could be stolen.
There was nothing more to read from the original writings of the electrical conductor than the fact that Bjartmar denigrated him.
The text has now been changed to Facebook and the headline of the original news DV updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the original news of the case is by no means descriptive for what was actually going on yesterday in the East.
Bjartmar said that he received information from a victim of electronics about the fact that it was really his electricals.
The information was given to the alleged owner, but the information was found to be incorrect, says Bjartmar.
“ I took care of the guy, and I recognized the shuttle, and I ended up with information that there was an electronicsman who had been missing for a very long time and was looking for.
I certainly hesitated first, but when I saw him prepare to drive off on the shuttle, I decide to cool with the man.
The owner was certain of his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I'm going very nice on such a case, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken the word off me."
Bjartmar says that the man on the electrical shaft just invited him to show him the receipt for the wheel and himself called the police.
"Yes, cool," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this straight."
So the electric shaft owner proved ownership of his electrical shaft and drove away.
Later, the correct owner of the electronicsman told his story on Facebook, as reported in the previous report.
In this long year, Bjartmar has been working on this practice, he says he can count the times that he came up against people on the fingers of another hand.
“ I’ve had peaceful relations with the toughest people in Reykjavik, ” said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are by far the smallest brothers and sisters in the community, addicts, and other people on the street for some reason.
“ The money is a hard master, and somehow the next dose needs to be funded, ” says Bjartmar, “worship is easy to achieve on such free arms.
“ Actually, my relationship with these people is so good that I’ve brought many of the good people with me.
Examples of people who went to treatment and went to see me and then came to see me and helped me do what I'm doing," he says.
In general, Bjartmars communicates with bicycles on polite notes.
Some know of him and what he is doing and offer peacefully to show him receipts, wheel numbers, and so on.
A large problem has been addressed in the use of bicycles.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police are even beginning to point people to talk to him because of stolen bicycles.
In the past, bears are in conflict with DV’s previous press release and do not claim to be a single self - appointed police officer in a personal search for justice.
Asked if he is still not on his tail with his actions, and if this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar certainly says it is.
“ Of course the police are doing this, but the fact is that the police are simply not doing this.
I've been looking up at policemen driving away from a big pile of stolen wheels.
She's clean, undefiled in these matters."
“ When the police aren’t doing anything in this, and this is just in front of your nose, and the experience has shown that I can succeed in this class, why not? ” asked Bjartmar.
He claims that he has achieved so much success in being on stolen wheels, that at times he encounters on the street with his “students, ” so they have just right the Bjartmarier wheels in which they had previously reached.
The times Bjartmar has called for help from the police have happened when she just won't.
“ It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault, and it’s not the owners of the bicycles to blame, ” said Bjartmar, and it’s sad that victims of bicycle thieves have to suffer from police promiscuity in this class.
About the results of Bjartmars is not shared.
In many places, stories of people can be found, thanks to Bjartmari, who has taken his possession back to them.
Bjartmar says for a long time, Bjartmar has lost the number of bicycles he has returned, but they probably run millions if not millions of years.
It weighs electricity, bicycles, and electric shafts heavily, but it can cost up to half a million.
Bears work in the day to play games, and every other weekend he works at a gym.
So his bicycle search is a unpaid job that he spends in his spare time.
Life - giving and long - suffering shadows
In 2019 there was a great year of birthday in the history of life - giving funds in Iceland.
True, civil servants had received a pension from the King of Dana from all the streets of the 19th century, but in 1919 the pension fund was established by officials who eventually became the capital fund of all civil servants.
The basis for existing pension funds for general wage earners was then laid down by universal labour market voting in 1969, where employment - related pension funds were imposed with compulsory and valid income collection from the early 1970s.
In 1974, laws on the basis of these agreements were in place, and then the bioequipment system continued to grow.
The wage system was not the only radical change that the 20th - century labor movement brought about by its courage struggle.
Similarly, unemployment insurance had taken place in historic strikes in 1955, and the organization was gradually brought forward with its demands for sickness and sickness funds, for severe leave, for shorter working hours, for housing improvements, and for other things.
All these rights took a great and strict battle but proved to be, after a much greater and more lasting campaign than the increase of the aurities in the wage envelope, which disappeared as much in the face of the inflation that characterized the postwar period and up to 1990 as many remember.
In 1969, the appealer to set up a general pension fund was both long and complex.
Even though the funds would eventually be the property of social society, the labor movement had to agree that their governments would appoint representatives of professional and social partners to the same extent.
In the following years after the fund was set up, the majority of the workers in the government of the funds were often involved in discussions in the employee organisations, but it was never achieved, and so we still have the abnormal arrangement that the representatives of society are not in the majority of the government of the funds.
Article 36, paragraph 129, of Law No 129/1997 on the guarantee of pension rights and the functioning of pension funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.
It says in the 1st figure that “the fund of life will have the interests of society as a guide. ”
Also, the fifth figure states: “The fund of life will set its moral standards for investments. ”
In the partnership policy of the City Council of Traders, the following provisions are included, in the context of the aforementioned legislative provisions:
The Pension Fund is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) regulations on responsible investments, together with many of the largest funds and professional Western and European funds.
The rules will consider how emphasis on environmental and social issues as well as good governance can contribute to improving investment performance in stock exchanges.
This brings together the interests of investors and the goals of society in a broader context.
LV believes it is important that companies, especially those registered in stock markets, set a public policy: to have a good governance approach to social responsibility and environmental issues.
The Gildi pension fund, which has the largest funds in the country, has set itself “a policy of responsible investments, ” and there are similar laws.
This is all referred to here as an introduction to the latest fashion words of the Icelandic, "shadow control".
Since the word is new in this case, it is not a hope that it has been defined very clearly, but the following definition now seems to me to be 'most taken': Shadow control is when the head of the union states in the media that he will send representatives of the community in the management of a bio-eye fund's recommendations or instructions on how to take a stand in this particular case.
If they do not heed the instructions, they will be removed from the government for the first practicality.
However, if the leader does not go along with this in the media and does not talk about resignation, then it is not “shadow control” because of this, of course, there is always communication between people in the financial world as elsewhere.
I let the reader think about which way he feels better.
In particular, two men have tried to mold this definition when it is written, in the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
There is a paperman in the newspaper, and Ásgeir in the bank manager, Jonsson.
Since Bogi Nils Bogason, President-in-Office of Icelandair, had announced his intention to terminate the association's agreements with airmen and airmen (tell them up), Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, president of the Reykjavik Trade Association, sent them the recommendations to the representative of the society of the BUU to not support the potential purchase of the fund in shares in the company, or they would have to be replaced.
Later, Bogi Nil withdrew his decision, and then Ragnar Thor went the same way with his recommendations, which, of course, was the basis for Boga’s decision.
Nevertheless, they saw a reason to discuss the matter in the Friday newspaper in great terms about shadow control, lawbreak, and the need for legal changes.
There would certainly be a slight roll - over of a heavy load, although the soft cloth had been connected, and it was also quickly wiped out.
Since the matter is important, let us consider the matter at the end of it.
I was before this point in the Life Island Law that is the subject of this matter.
In this context, it is up to the government to take care of the interests of society and to have a moral basis for investments, and these are more detailed in the approved acts of both Gildis and the Life - Ion’s Fund, as I mentioned.
Pension funds, however, are NOT to be viewed solely for short-term gainful policies in their investments.
Such a course would be just a dangerous one and would not have to be long - term examples of such things in the past, where a large loan to banks and banks has led to immoral adventurers and environmental threats, with tragic consequences.
Clearly, the president of Icelandair was on high ice when he thought of wiping out a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the kindness that the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position toward investors.
Happily, he saw and pulled it back.
Time will tell us if this will do enough to make the fund investment in the partner count as responsible to the community at the time.

One of the infected persons did not have a return suspect
One of the three identified by Covid-19 on the country yesterday came to the country from the Baltic Sea on July 15th, about a week and a half ago.
However, he is an Icelander who is not regularly resident here and thus did not receive clear instructions to carry out so - called return fraud after arriving in the country and to take another sample a few days after arriving.
He got negative from screening at the border.
“But he’s in Icelandic society, and he should actually be in that facility, ” says Kamilla Josepsdóttir, a specialist in the area of sickness at the Land Doctor and the local investigator during his summer vacation, in a conversation with the newspaper today.
“He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to file the ID number, and if the ID number is not registered, you are not automatically announced in the subsequent view. ”
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually living abroad but because of his connection on the land that an Icelandic should have used it.
Yet, he did not understand.
“ When the ID number is not recorded, you will have to reach out for the second sample yourself.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that this is the right way," says Kamilla.
“ This makes it clear that we need to expand our information campaign while we find some way to do the automatic preaching system, even if the Icelandics do not record their identification.
Or, somehow, to make it more obvious who are participants in Icelandic society in the registration system," she explains.
Luckily, though, the person is few at the time of his arrival in the country, even though he is defined as a participant in Icelandic society, an Icelander.
Only six have been sent in after he was diagnosed yesterday and were all in contact with him.
They're going to have a sample, but two of them are beginning to show the symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man was negative from his practice at the border on July 15.
Kamilla likely said that he was recently infected by the virus that she could not yet be detected when the sample was taken to the border.
However, she does not want to rule out the possibility of man being infected here in Iceland but does not carry the virus to her country.
“It’s not quite possible to argue that this is a certain import because it’s been a long time since he came to the country that he might have been exposed here like these two who have caused a little control in connection with the sports tournaments. ”
Yet, she says that it is very unlikely because of the few people around here.
“ It is really very unlikely, ” says Kamilla, but points out that it cannot be excluded until the identification of the virus in man has been completed.
“If we get a virus that hasn’t been seen here before, it’s almost certain that he carried it to the country. ”
Pipettes and bombs used against Protestants
There was a conflict between the police and the Protestants in Seattle last night.
The police used proselytes with peppers and unbanished hand bombs, but the Protestants broke windows and set fire to fire.
45 Protestants were arrested, and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racial prejudice were protested in many parts of the United States last night, but the protests in Seattle were in support of Protestants in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one Protestant was shot to death.
As noted on the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands met in peaceful protests.
A group then set fire to a construction site and broke windows in the city’s courthouse.
Following this, the police said that the protest was a mess, and there was a conflict between Protestants and the police.
Require justice in Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23 - year - old black man who was murdered by the August police last year, was mentioned by the Protestants.
A car went through a group of Protestants in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of black national guards came together and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26 - year - old black woman who was murdered by the police in her home in March.
The group carried firearms and went to state, following closed street conventions, where the police assigned the group to protesters and guns.
Then 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where Protestants remembered James Scurlock, a 22 - year - old black man murdered by a white barignant in May.
Sunshine: Not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solsskjær, director of the football team Manchester United, does not want to overdo the importance of the game with Leicester today in the final round of the English selection department.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea doesn't lose against Wolves, end Sunshine and his men in the fifth place and loses that of Master's Seat.
However, they still hope to enter the Masters Department by working with the European Department next month.
“ We’re not at the end of the line.
If we get to the point against Leicester, I think people will say that we have now not had a bad period," said Solskör.
“ But whatever happens, it’s not the end of our journey, because we still have a great deal of land getting the two people above us, ” Solskjær said.
Clearly, the nerves of men become dandruff at 3: 15 p.m., but Solskjör tried to act as if every other game was being discussed.
“ If you want to be a member of Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure during the last season.
It's nothing new, and it's based on the company.
We've created a great opportunity to end the season well, and now it's our time to use it," said Sunshine.
“ It’s not the most important game of the season, it’s just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The finals don't define our period, we've already had many hours to define this period."
“ Bruno Fernandes’ arrival changed a lot for us, and I believe that we are in a better form and far more spiritually than in the last period, ” Solsskär said.
65,000 infections per cycle
In the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University, 65,490 new infections of the crown virus were detected.
Overall, 4.178,021 infection has been confirmed from the beginning of the epidemic in that country.
900 died from the virus yesterday, but for the last four days, there were deaths due to the virus more than 1,000 per day.
A total of 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
It is reported in CNN that according to the U.S. Pathology, the number of deaths caused by the virus will be 175,000 on August 15, the second.
Fear of the Second Epidemic Wave
Today, the Spanish government may try to hold back from the increased spread of COVID-19 in the country.
The Spanish Health Authority reported over 920 new cases of COVID–19, both on Thursday and Friday.
No more of these have been identified in May at the beginning of May, and the news is coming at the same time that the Spanish begin to remove one of the most stringent bans in Europe.
As a result of the setback, the British authorities now owe passengers who come from Spain to leave home.
A week earlier, Spain was listed as the United Kingdom’s safe kingdom.
The situation is worst in Catalonia, in northeastern Spain, where governments have grasped the wider limits to try to match growth levels.
In the capital of Barselona, entertainment facilities will be closed for the next two weeks, and elders will close at midnight.
A curfew is now in force for 200,000 Segria County residents in the west of Catalonia.
The British decision is thought to have a negative effect on the Spanish economy, which is very concerned about the arrival of foreign tourists and is in bad shape after the end of the century.
Tui, Britain’s largest travel office, cancelled all the flights planned for today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
The government in many parts of the world is told to prepare for the second epidemic wave, but there seems to be little interest in returning to the extensive curfew that has destroyed the economy in many parts of the world.
To form, Mr. Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, has taken a very bad look at it and compared it to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Then Jean Castex, France’s prime minister, has said that the nation would “not survive, economically or socially,” if again the national curfew was taken.
Many recruiters hope that local measures will be taken to cover individual towns, cities, or areas to keep the virus back on the next round if it comes to it.
5 new infections in Iceland - Three inland
Three inland infections were detected yesterday, plus two more in addition to the border.
Thus, five people with positive Covid-19 were diagnosed yesterday in Iceland.
According to a public health report, one of the infections is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
Has he been sent to isolation, and sixteen who were in close contact with him for sickness?
The infected person was a participant in the social work of a sports club in Reykjavik, and according to the report, the “only part of the sport” was in a quarantine.
Others who were sent to a hospital are related to the man in another way.
The origin of this infection is unimaginable and fully infected by a police officer.
The ReyCUP convention opponent has followed the instructions and rules of the pathologist and the public protection body that are still in force and appropriate measures have been taken.
However, pictures of the convention were not to be seen in a very close association as they rejoiced in the good conduct of their people on the field.
Just before 11 o'clock today, opponents published the following notice on their Facebook page.
It says: “ATH, parents will respect the rules that the racers pick up their own stuff at school.
Parents aren't allowed to do that.
Thank you for your vision."
Other infections were diagnosed yesterday, but related to the infection reported last day.
Says the announcement: “Isian genetic analysis has ordered the infection and has revealed a new type of virus that has not been detected here before. ”
This is also the case of infection, and it is also infected in isolation and 12 for infection.
The third infection from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, July 15th.
He was diagnosed at the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in isolation and six who were in close contact with him on a leash.
Two of them are already showing signs of viral infection.
In addition, two of them were identified at the border and are waiting for the results of further studies such as the disease career at the border.
Finally, the report states: The National Police Department and the national surgeon’s office make it necessary for people to take care and care of their individual protections.
If there is any doubt as to the presence of the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus, the same person is asked to take a sample at the nearest clinic.
Patreksfjord says the tent area booked on the weekend of merchants - Direct guests else
The cover area of Patreksvärd is completed this weekend, according to a report from the West.
Visitors are told to look at other accommodations.
The names of the West Building of Bildudal, Tolkjärður, Melanes, in the Red Sea, in the Hotel Flokalund, and Hotel Bilívívík as a second option in the position.
There is enough to be on Patreksfig this weekend, for, as in previous years, the House of Ward, a festival of Icelandic sources, will be held in town.
It has been held since 2007 and thus become a strong town tradition.
On the occasion of an application in the tent area, a good meeting can be expected this year, if the weather does not set a line in account, but the DV said earlier today from a bad prediction.
However, the worst weather can be expected in the south, as well as a hope for Patrex.
The paper bb.is first reported, saying that all other accommodations in town were already fully booked.
A whole apartment house grows down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live in Dunhaga 18-20 free.
During this period, owners seek a new building permit, but their business has gone on in the system for the third year.
In one of Reykjavik city’s oldest, greenest, and most expensive neighborhoods, there is a magnificent apartment house on three floors.
The height of the house is about 600 square feet [600 sq m] of commercial space.
The back of the house are the doors of two ladders, each containing four pretty beautiful apartments.
Are they between 93 and 130 square meters, though most of them are over 100.
The house has a great deal of history.
It was built in 1959, and it has hosted a video store, a school shop, a dairy shop, a Joa gunsmith, a fish store, and now, last time, a university printer.
The house hath, so lightly to speak, remembered its fig beautifying.
The house is now severely damaged, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of the D18 ehf. are according to a business catalogue among the others Magnus Magnusson and Gudrun Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús was the owner of the Borg and was the defender of the Borging property.
One of the owner-owned property companies is Stálskir Ehf.
A steel vessel, though, is the investment company of Guðrunn Saint Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrun is also an owner of a third part of D18.
Guðrun and her husband, Augustus Gudmundur the son of Sigurðd, once ran a steel ship.
In the summer of 2009, D18 ehf. bought the house, so it has little that has been kept since then.
Tell neighbors that the situation of the house has worsened steadily since, though, in recent years.
On the Facebook page of the neighborhood, one resident says that the house “was not particularly lively last year. ”
For a few years, owners may have sought to change the house and the lot.
Other neighbors say the house hasn't been okay for a long time.
“It’s a long time to do something nice about this spot and it’s boring that this has been drawn like this. ”
He also says he's pissed off at the owner of the house for not having done this, finding someone in common with the neighbors of the house, and stopping this "lawy act."
"Just do this in consultation with the community so you can get on with it and finish it."
The ‘Scientific stage’, which is the ready-to-use structure of the field, which has been in progress at least since 2017.
Then the owners of Dunhagen lived 18 and 20 after permission to build a hill on top of the existing apartment building and behind the house, a new elevator house, and a one - floor building, as well as a basement.
The building permit granted for that operation was charged to the Committee on Environment, Resources and Rural Development, and it was devalued by the fact that the project was not supported by a division structure and that local knowledge was not adequate.
The city of Reykjavik then started with a divisional organization and finished it with an advertisement in the July of last July newspaper.
That organization was also charged with it, and the committee dropped it out of effect in March 2020.
At that point, therefore, nearly three years had passed since the original application for the building permit and the owners of the house at the beginning.
At that time, the house had been affected, and neighbors began to tire out.
When the DV asked the neighbor of the house about the situation and the reaction of the neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the intended owners of the house, others not at all.
Others directed anger to the city, others not.
Others were only angry, but nothing necessarily happened to anyone.
Still others said the driving conditions were a dispute, but neighbors have a new unused parking space for Dunhaga 18-20 under their vehicles.
One indictor said he was tired of the board:
“ The fact that we have to go through the process in three times is quite amazing.
It's like Reykjavíkborg doesn't know how to read."
Today, the house is empty, abandoned, and neglected.
In response, the city’s management team and its owner’s noble intentions and many years of work at the start of the day were overturned.
When a journalist hit the garden of Dunhaga 18 he bled with a wide - open door and a garbage pile.
Playstation computers and recent television were in other garbage on earth — victims of Icelandic summer flashes.
Opened into the old office of the University Preacher and there quite a bit of cats of the smell of hounds to judge.
Clearly, at one corner, someone has been riding around, but no one is visible.
The stacks of sofas and beds and several boards of earth’s pages, which were likely to become a book, answered.
The steps of the apartment house were also open and life in both of them.
A journalist was so lucky that one of their own people was struck.
The Romanians had a potato meal and invited the reporter in.
The rooms work for the Ztrongforce eh.
They've been there for some time and they've been copying DV's sources that the company has paid nothing for the accommodation except heat and electricity.
Because of the situation of the house, it is not defenceable to collect rent.
From the direction of the house’s opposition, it is clear that there have been a number of foreign workers in the last years.
The activities of staff members have not been part of the Covid-19 situation, end a merger in tourism led to a merger in the construction sector and these two industries have been as effective as using the services of staff members.
Nevertheless, Dunhaga 18 householders seemed to have enough to do and kept the work flaws and winters in the community to dry after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the miserable condition of the house, the apartment seemed to be well maintained by the boys.
When a journalist said to the boys in bed, the sarcasm suddenly became clear: In the best place in Reykjavik, 1,500 square feet of real estate is submerged.
Owners want to make the house better and neighbors want to improve their situation but share the definition of “better”.
Between now and then the city's area of organisation sits on its initial site, the victim of endless appeals and carelessness in the planning process and the phased resolution of the Committee on Environment and Resources.
In the house there are so bedridden workers, perhaps just those who are going to improve the situation, when the Icelandics stop fighting.
The article appeared initially in the July 17 issue of DV.
In an overdose following a chronic viral epidemic
Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, will give 10 million pounds for a campaign against overweight, which will include the prohibition of short - term advertising, following his severe illness, partly due to his weight.
According to Johnson’s presentation of the campaign called Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe bicycles for their clients in overweight and will also be attacked by the rise of bicycles.
Then TV advertising will be banned before 21 p.m., according to the British news.
“COVID–19 has aroused us to the short and long-term risks of being overweight, and the prime minister is determined that we must use the time to become healthier, more effective and to eat healthy food,” has been told by the government spokesperson.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was put into intensive care when he was infected by the crown virus this spring, and it is partly his weight because he is thought to have become so severe.
Women better to lead the changes
Did it say that the new constitution was the largest step that the nation could take toward greater distribution of power, transparency, and anti-destruction, and general interests?
“ We need to change gear a bit now, and who is better at bringing such changes than the group of society that can help to be in these values.
"There are women," Helga said.
“ In Iceland, women are famous for their women’s union.
Together and together to bring about changes.
So now we're just about to lead these changes."
Said she was a little nervous about the emphasis in Iceland as the “best in the world” in both gender equality and human rights.
“ Then we are not as ready to see what needs to be done.
Like the Germans, they are very conscious of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
That's a lot.
We need to know where we are coming from and where we know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of border groups.
We don't live with the same rules here," Helga said.
She said that many women are in good health in Iceland, but she added that, as elsewhere, Iceland had enormous male values.
Did she say that the politics turned to form their own interests, authority, and authority, which were the forces that maintained the wrong in all communities.
“Women are now starting this group and coming together and are only a little frustrated by the fact that since 2012, the General Assembly will move forward to overlook this national vote. ”
“ These are the female values we are thinking about.
Based on human rights and nature protection, cooperation and that we are all really sitting at the same level," she said, adding that the above-mentioned values were the starting point of the new constitution.
“ We are a very rich country of natural poverty, and it is ridiculous that there are people living with poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can trade differently," said Helga.
“ It is ridiculous that there is some natural law that women’s jobs are always lower.
It's ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses will have to stand up for courage just to get a decent salary."
The signature list of a new constitution can be signed here through Iceland’s electronic system.
Trying to rob a walking walker in the city centre
A man was arrested in the city centre last night after threatening pedestrians and trying to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Årby, where two were arrested for the case.
Then the police stopped a motorbike driver in Hlädes, where his driver was 146 km faster, with a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of his right to drive.
The police in the capital city had enough to turn tonight and were in over 80 cases recorded in the police diary from yesterday five to five this morning.
Then there was a lot of noise announcements because of a social event.
On Saturday, 11 were reported to a noisy party and found it very much in the police diary.
But last night, there were 22 noises riding on the force.
Six were saved in a prison cell last night.
The Watch Tower was called to night when fireworks were shot by parties.
Yet, they had escaped when policemen were in the garden.
Then nine drivers were stopped for drunk or drug driving.
Four were arrested for fighting in the middle of the night, one of which was kept in a prison cell.
Then two were taken to an emergency department after they fell on their faces, one in the city center, and the other in the West.
One was transferred to an accident department after he was injured to jump on a trampoline in Copavogi.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver who pulled a trailer on Kjalarnesi yesterday.
According to the police journal, the trailer was in “very bad conditions” and was stationary.
You can stay at Monet's House on the weekend of shopping
The house in which the impressionist Claude Monet spent the last 40 years is now renting on the side Airbnb.
The next free night in the house is at the storehouse.
The house is small and lovely, located in the town of Gerenry, Normandie, France.
From 1883 until the death of the painter, he lived in the house in 1926.
There are three bedrooms, two living rooms, and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his gardens famous in this house.
If someone intends to rent the house, he must rent at least two nights.
Based on Airbnb’s page, it’s next free after a week, on the Sunday of the shopkeeper’s weekend, and therefore may be the perfect choice for some shoppers on vacation to engage in booking the painter’s house.
Only a total of 964 U.S. valleys or just over $ 130,000 are reached by the U.S. Newspaper.
Seizures and some of these begin to show the signs of the disease caused by the crown virus
Five have been identified by the intranasal chorus virus in the last three days, and most of the infected are unconnected.
Tugs have become sick because of this, and some of them are beginning to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three of them were diagnosed by the intranasal chorus virus yesterday and two at border crossing points.
According to a specialist from a terrestrial doctor, growing numbers of inland infections do not necessarily include spreading the virus in the wider community.
“ There has been a sequencing from the previous inland infection, and there is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no particular reason to believe that it has been hidden in the community for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very careful now," said Kamilla Sigriður Josephsdóttir, a specialist in the pediatric field.
Most of them have been in contact with foreign - based individuals.
More samples are required in the near future, but some who were in contact with the infected are beginning to display the symptoms of the crown virus.
“ Now, the flu is not going on and is reminding of other respiratory infections, so we can be quite free by doing these tests on individuals who had found reason to do something else first,” said Kamilla.
Contagion is mostly complete, but it is not excluded that more people need to get sick.
Two infected people were diagnosed after attending sports events.
Has it raised questions as to whether it is defensive to hold such events?
The head of public health is saying it slowly as long as people follow standards and rules.
Kamilla says almost impossible that the infected have been infected at the sports conventions.
“ If there are no more people in isolation from these people after they have been around them at these sports conventions, we can claim that our sickness preventions at the conventions have worked.
But it's not revealed," said Kamilla.
The work of the Public Protection Department is under constant review.
“We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if it seems appropriate,” said Kamilla.
After over a week, there will be a large number of limits that will be reached into a thousand people.
This new situation may affect relaxation.
"A certain thought to cook" - See Elisa Vidar's menu
Elizabeth Vársdóttir is a great - show lady playing with Val.
She is also a master student in nutrition, a mother, and serves as a food analyst.
It takes a lot of energy for the day’s chores, and it usually takes time to cook good and nutritious food.
My usual day starts by attending work from eight," says Elisha.
"After work, I'm going to the camp to prepare my dinner before I pick up my girl at the gym about 3:00. "
Elisa finds it very nurturing to attend her daughter early in theater school.
“ It’s good to have some time with her before I practice the second part.
After practice, it's good to come home and just have to warm up the food.
In the evening, when the girl is asleep, we like to look at one factor to empty our mind."
Elisha does not follow a certain diet.
She is putting a final hand on a master’s paper in nutrition, and she well knows what it takes to eat so that she can have enough energy to do her job, school, family, and exercise.
“ What suits me is eating a variety of foods that are well made up of proteins, carbohydrates, and fat.
However, I feel that it is most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not to classify food in bad or good, rather nutritional or nutritional poverty.
It's almost all right to eat everything, just not everything at all, and not always."
Elisha is very interested in cooking.
“ I feel that I have some thought about standing in the kitchen cooking and getting it very much.
I must say that my confidence is with me in the kitchen, and I sincerely believe that I am a fine cook."
Breakfast: Havnar, chia seed, hemp seed, salt, a little lemon juice, let lie in almond milk overnight.
Top this meal with what exists each time.
Most of the time, it's a banana and jumped musli & KAFFI.
I'm a big coffee lady.
Medium: Unbelievably different, but fruit or vegetables, flat cakes, clean shirts with bananas and musli, bread with pastry, and then I could eat hummus with a spoon up from bex if that is the case.
Lunches: I often make all kinds of food salads from what is in the fridge, quinae, or barley, falafelball, rock salad, overcoated vegetables with good dressing is something I’m working with.
If the organization goes completely out of control (which often happens) then the egg machine at work has often saved me, and then there are two breads with butter, cheese, and sooted eggs, don’t put any more on you.
Billion: Make me have something carbohydrate for practice, for bread with a pastry, for breakfast, or for fruit.
Dinner: Fish will be very often chosen in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Police and Protestant conflicts in Seattle
The city authorities of Seattle, Washington, have declared a state of rebellion following a large number of protests in the Middle East.
Yesterday, police arrested a bomb and pepper spray to try to destroy a large area that the Protestants occupied and extended over many houses in the vicinity of the town hall.
The police reported on Twitter that at least 11 protesters had been arrested and that a study of some kind of bomb could have been carried out at a police station in the city yesterday.
City and police authorities say that protesters stoned the police with rocks, bottles, vaults, and other promiscuity, and one policeman was transferred to a hospital where his injuries were caused.
Yet, Seattle’s protests were peaceful for a long time.
They were presented to protesters in Portland, Oregon, a city where there have been severe conflicts between Protestants and heavy - weaponed federal police forces.
There, like in other cities of the United States, people gather under Black Lives Matter, recall George Floyds, who was killed by a policeman in Minneapolis on May 25, protesting systematic racism in American society and demanding replacements.
Not revoked until after vote
It is not yet clear whether the termination of the flight of Icelandair, which will take effect by the next month, will be revoked.
An ambitious vote on the Icelandar Air Free Society's vote ends tomorrow at noon.
Godfors Liney John’s daughter - in - law president of the community confidently states that Icelandar will not make the decision until the vote’s conclusion is reached.
“ It’s really hanging out together, ” says God’s pool of Liney.
“ There have been no cancellations, this must be put in place so that the machines can be manned.
And, of course, people are ungrateful after learning whether they will be working after the month."
A contract signed a week ago was approved in July 19.
It is expected that it will be valid until the end of September 2025, and it will be based on a contract previously agreed by flight attendants.
On July 17th, the Government of Iceland’s Flyfree Society agreed to declare an all - military stop to Icelandair, and it was approved by the local community for a vote.
Never came to her, but this was decided upon following the decision of the Icelandas to stop the conversation with the Fly-Free Society, to quit all their flight attendants, and to look for negotiations with another classmate.
At that time, the community pilots were to take on temporary duty.
Ask her how she believes that the vote will take place.
“ People are in pain after this action of Icelandair, when all the flight attendants of the community were cancelled and reported that the deal would be with another classmate.
Now it turns out whether it affects," she says.
At the end of April, 940 pilots worked at Icelandas, which had 900 of them, about 95% of them.
Their dissatisfaction is different for those who have the shortest age of work three months, and it ends in July-August.
That's about 90% of Icelandair's flight fees.
What will we do if the agreement is not approved?
“ We would like to continue our conversations with our colleagues.
With this contract, we are meeting the requirements of Icelandair.
If he's been rejected, it's clear that the plane's been gone too far."
A vote on a collective agreement is over, and Icelandair will present the second quarter tomorrow.
The Air Force vote on a new treaty will end at noon tomorrow.
The production of Icelandas for the second quarter of the year will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary results indicate that social income fell by 85 percent from the same period last year.
An electronic vote on the agreement between Iceland’s Fly Fries and the Business Association for Icelandar began on Wednesday, July 22, and ends tomorrow, Monday, July 27, at noon.
Those who are allowed to opt for the agreement are Icelanda's employees who pay social expenses to the Fly Free Trade Association.
Icelandair and the FFI signed a new agreement on the entry into force of Sunday, July 19, but Friday before that, Icelandair had broken off the talks with the company after the pilots joined the previous agreement in a vote at the beginning of July.
At that time, Icelandas had given up all the flight attendants and flight crews on Friday, but they were withdrawn after the signing of a new agreement.
According to a new collective agreement, pilots need to fly five hours a month for the same basic salary.
The agreement is valid until 2025, but the pilot’s and pilot’s plans have been integrated for how long to fly on one watch.
The contract was introduced to FFI members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordic Hotel last Monday, and described many aircraft that the news agency discussed with them about the discomfort caused by the agreement.
Most, however, seemed to agree that the agreement had to be agreed to to keep the FBI alive.
The production of Icelandas for a second quarter of a year will be introduced tomorrow, while the EBIT community, its operating income for resources and taxes, has a negative impact of about 100 to 110 million U.S. dollars, or about 15 billion U.S. dollars.
Icelandar sent preliminary calculations to the Copenhagen Hall last Wednesday, which said that the social income spent some $60 million in the quarter or $8.3 billion.
At the end of the quarter, about $21 billion, hand money and its equivalent were about 154 million dollars.
Icelandas also aim to offer part of their society in August.
Icelandar is planning to complete contracts with 15 borrowers, government agencies, and Boeing aircraft manufacturer by the end of a month before being offered part-time.
New variant rather than new type of virus
“ A new virus just means that it has been a person who came from abroad.
It's not something that's been grinding in this country," says Má Kristjánsson, chief medical officer of the National Hospital's Department of Disease, who reports that "a new type of virus" has been detected in this country.
Three inland infections were detected yesterday, and two at the border.
One who had been diagnosed to share in the social activities of a sports club at the Rey Cup soccer convention, the origin of the disease being unfounded and infected.
A person who arrived in the country on July 15 was also diagnosed and two who were in contact with him started to show signs of COVID-19.
There was then a diagnosis of infection in yesterday associated with infection reported on the previous day and after sequencing in the Icelandic genetic analysis, “a new type of virus that has not been detected here before”.
Contagion is complete in association with this infection.
It may be noted that the virus is not new, it is the same virus that has spread around the world, i.e. the new crown virus SARS-CoV-2.
It is better to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asked what it is and whether it might say something about another epidemic coming to light, Már says that as a single case, there might be no more of it.
“ However, if domestic events do occur that do not have foreign links and have the same genotype as this particular variant, then [later wave] could conclude, but it is not yet so long to be supported, ” explains Már.
Happy hot tub
Is the secret to the happiness of the Icelandics hidden in the hot pots?
The BBC schedulers lead to the likeness of a fun video that sheds light on the verge and hotspot culture of the country.
The Icelandic bathing culture is special worldwide, and it is claimed that there are no more bathing places in the world than each citizen.
The earth’s natural heat is its foundation, but also its tradition of divisiveness.
In 1940, children were legally taught by sun, but older citizens are no less able to use their hot water to improve their health.
Sun travel is described as a fixed part of the country’s overall well - being.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class and position.
At the cell phone, people discuss home - space personal notes or enjoy the similar power of water: meditation and loading of soul and body batteries.
On the brink to pick up a hundred days in a election
There are hundreds of days until the Americans vote and elect their president for four years.
Donald Trump is looking for a re-election, but he's still going to be there to pick up.
Joe Biden, the potential promoter of the Democratic Party, has a strong preference for Trump on the national level, taking account of polls.
According to a recent survey of the AP news industry, many Americans believe that the nation is in the wrong direction.
Trump’s response to the pandemic of the new crown virus is also very unfriendly, and more Americans believe that the President’s economic situation was not affected.
In particular, only two out of every ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent claim to support Trump’s response to the epidemic, and 48 percent say that he has maintained a good economic climate.
In March it was 56 percent, and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the average FiveThirtyEight is following Biden 49.9 percent on the national market but following the Trump 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to shift attention from his performance toward his father, Biden, to promote so - called cultural debates, and to promote policies that are designed to turn to law and order.
However, Biden’s proposals work hard to keep Trump’s attention focused on it and consider it very likely that if the vote is actually about how Trump has been working in the last four years, it will be possible to take a victory.
The enemy Trump also seems to come down on the councils of the Republican party and fears the Proms that the Democrats could even achieve the majority of the U.S. Congress, which until now has felt very suffocated.
Politico reported on the days of keeping track of groups and candidates comparable to what the Republican party would have its biggest haughtiness for decades.
The EDP has been particularly bad in the 2016 Congresses and now looks like that evolution will continue.
Trump has in recent times tried to scare the inhabitants of the suburbs to follow him, including by becoming President Biden, he will destroy the suburbs of the United States and promote racial strife.
For example, from the time Barack Obama in the White House, Trump has closed down a rule designed to increase diversity in the suburbs.
Then he urged the U.S. suburbs to read an article after New York’s former assistant director, who claimed that Benden would destroy the U.S. suburbs and took Trump under it.
“ It will destroy your neighborhoods and your American dreams.
I will keep it, and even make it even better!" said the President.
The U.S. suburbs are becoming a growing group of voters.
According to the NPR, they are about half the voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become President.
Except in 2012, when Mitt Romney received the majority of votes from this group but lost for Barack Obama.
The findings have shown that despite the fact that Trump secured a small majority in the suburbs of 2016, its follow-up has been substantially delayed.
Although there are differences between the tests, Biden has measured about 15 percent of the advances in Trump in the extant world.

After the final decision had been made to delay the Olympic Games, an event that only World Wars have rocked up to now, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic Fire would be “the light at the end of the passages, ” and there was the possibility of a pandemic of the crown virus that is now passing through the inhabited earth.
An additional year has been spent by the Africans to prepare and the Japanese authorities to make up for the cost of delay.
Yet, everyone keeps his head at large.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the scene of the Olympic Games this year, the happy words of the Japanese representatives were genuine.
They wept and laughed, after which Tokyo had applied to keep the games in 2016 but let it replace Rio in Brazil.
This time Tokyo and Japan would have to bathe in the attention of the world.
The games were due to take place from July 24 to August 9, but for a year it has been postponed, starting instead of July 23, 2021, and ending August 8.
If they fail to keep the games, if the crown virus still becomes too much threat, the games will be stopped.
Yet, no one really wants to think that thought to the end.
Olympics are not a regular sports competition.
There is nothing to be saved, the show is always going to be great, and looking for the top of the last game.
The election of a city for Olympics is based on the assessment of the city's audiences.
The more grand the presentation is — the more likely to get caught.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to keep the Olympics in 2016 or over $20 billion.
The second time, when the games were applied for in 2020, $75 million, about $10 billion, were placed in the presentation.
In 2013, when Tokyo was decided to have the games this year, the Japanese authorities had already spent $30 billion on the project.
But that amount is only a drop in the ocean, given the cost of building Olympic villages, stadiums, and the general need to strengthen the interior of the country to cope with such conventions, prepare them, and keep the games themselves.
Organizations in Japan have said that the Olympic Games in Tokyo, which should have been in progress these days but has been postponed for a year because of the crown virus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report by the public accountant in Japan, published at the end of last year, found that the cost was almost double that figure.
The cost of delaying the games is likely not to be fully assessed, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the original cost.
Thus, the total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could range from 15 to 30 billion dollars.
There are so many figures that all tax revenue in the Icelandic State was only about half of the Olympic Games, compared to the lowest possible cost.
Olympics are an event of magnitude that they have often become the subject of economics, who try to dispel numbers and view the benefits and benefits of the games.
In the lead, it seems that many people have concluded that the effect of the Olympic Games is less than so positive to the finances of the cities that keep them.
The short - term effects are some, for example, increasing jobs for a very short period of time, but for a long time, cities tend to be left with a debt crisis and a high cost of operating a little used person.
Rio, Brazil, is living with a heavy debt due to the games in 2016 and has been in trouble at the expense of the maintenance of all the major athletes built for the games.
After the games in London in 2012, only 10 percent of those who received jobs related to the Olympics in the city were previously unemployed.
This means that only a small amount of new jobs were involved.
In general, it has not been particularly beneficial for cities to maintain Olympics financially because of the seductive cost of human activation built for the games.
However, the benefits are often considered to be increased rounds of tourists who want to visit the cities of Olympics following the games, which, however, are very uncertain about the games 2021.
Also, it is uncertain whether all the audiences who usually attend the games must be accepted.
However, the principal issue is the honor that cities have to be given, but it is hard to appreciate for money.
In spite of enormous costs, however, it can also be said that the joy the players bring is not the kind of thing that can be put on it.
But while the exhibition is often magnificent and there is no saving, of course, this is not just about money.
It's the sports heroes who are in the foreground.
For some extremes, it is surprising that it is only a pleasure to delay the games.
For example, in his article on the Olympics page of Chloe Esposito, an Australian fifth - laureate and gold laureate, for example, had been far from a good joke for the summer but has no hope of becoming competitive for the 2021 games.
So it is among those athletes who are rather satisfied with the temptation, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who were planning to quit the games this year, they would have been held at the right time, meaning in some cases that they would stop playing before the games take place.
Simply trust their bodies not to go through years in addition to strict exercises.
Few athletes made their way into the hearts of the audience at the Olympics in Rio in 2016 and the gymnastic star Simone Biles.
She came home with four golds around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has been attending several interviews in his native United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She's planning on the 2021 games, but she's not sure she'll still be at the top of the games next year, then she'll be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered high age, it is higher for a gymnastic woman in the first place.
“ It’s a sensitive subject, ” says Biles, but smiles into another interview published on the Instagram page of the Olympics Committee asked whether she is planning to reach the game in 2021 as long as she did in Rio 2016.
“ I just don’t know if I’ll still be on top after a year in addition to practice, ” says Biles.
She has previously said that her body is unable to tolerate the stress of gymnastic training much longer.
Nevertheless, she is zealously training for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was a uncomfortable feeling to have to stop suddenly practicing when the pandemic stood at the highest and the gym was closed.
There were no exceptions to Mr. Biles rather than others while all the athletes were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic gold could not buy any access beyond the others; she had to find ways to stay in shape like others.
Surely, the basic form is a bit better than that of most people.
“We’ve got a strict plan now.
It was difficult to start rehearsing after the gym opened.
We started slowly, but we're back to fullness, and I'm going to extend the exercises steadily as the year goes by.
Of course, we do not know exactly how these games will be, or whether they will be, but we are still training based on their ability to do so.
I've worked too hard to leave the sport now," says Biles.
With it, like other blind doubt or perhaps more conscious of the fact that the event may arise that the games will not be held at all in 2021 but in 2021.
Foretelling this, however, is hopeless.
No one can know how the situation during the pandemic of the crown virus will be done in July 2021 and nothing but to prepare for the Olympic Games when they are held this year.
Maybe the Olympic Fire will be lighted at the end of the Covid walks.
Preservation for an Epidemic Marriage
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding for the crown virus.
She was supposed to marry the ex-Bachelorette racer Wells Adams this summer.
“I think it’s other more important things to think about right now,” said the actress in a conversation with People.
“ We would like to get married sometime and then have our dream wedding and have all those who love us.
But we decided to hold it late and focus on what is important now, and it is helping to share information about the importance of masking and staying at home.
I'm looking at world affairs more than I'm looking at weddings these days.
There's a lot going on and we're supposed to focus our attention on what's happening in the world."
