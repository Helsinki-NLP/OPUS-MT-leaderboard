She's taken on too much work.
She's stubborn.
Give Tom a handle.

Does Tom know how you feel about him?
Tom wondered if what Mary said was true.
We'll never get along.
It is uncertain whether the letter ever arrived or not.
We didn't do anything.
You dropped your pen.
Are you gonna lie in bed all day, or what?
Tom can't do that.
Tom crawled under the tag wire.
I didn't even know her name.
Are you really going to do that?

Did I forget something?
You're longer than me.
Happy birthday.
I don't even want you here.
I like to go to new places and see new things.
I have to sit down.
Aren't we friends?

You should have liked it.
I've got a few more.
I'm using the computer.
Six were invited, including the boy.
Kate's a cold.
I know you miss your family.
What was your plan?
Tom seems bored.
He's not angry.
There is no doubt as to who will be elected.
He got hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or a interesting hobby to keep myself motivated.
It's weird.
Have you read the story of the ring trilogy?
I'm a man now.
Greek is not an easy language.
Thank you for taking care of my dog.

Get back into the van.
She helped the old man across the road.
No one's too old to learn.
I'd do anything for love.
Two men with ski masks went into the bank.
This book belongs to the school library.
None of it was real.
There must be a pattern.
It hurts to have to say this, but it's the truth.
Tom fooled me.
Tom's helping.
One morning, he saw a pretty girl.
This tree is not even near being the highest in the socks.
Let me take a look.
Tom wants our help.
Time's up.
My father's healthy.
We can save a lot of lives.
If you don't have any money, you'll be fine without it.
I'm afraid to go home.
Just say it.

Put the cake on the table.
I know you're angry.
Do you need anything?
I want a pair of gloves.
That's exactly what I needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I'm already late.
Even Mom knows about it.
He should have done it already.
Room service, please.
Who were you talking to?
The boy took hold of the cat's tail.
How do you know that?
I got a lot of mosquito bites.
I'm unemployed.
This medicine will cure your cold.
Does this remind you of anyone?
I'd like to talk to Tom in between four eyes.
He will fall for the temptation.
The TV's not working.
I can explain that.
She behaves like a child.
What's it look like?
Mary thinks she's got superpowers.
I know all this.
Everyone needs to know.
After stopping, the train accelerated quickly.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to agree, but at least you can accept that there are people who have opinions other than you?
Tom dropped the book.
I'm the best.
English is hard, isn't it?
I can go to school in 10 minutes.
Are you done now?
She couldn't imagine seeing him again.
Even during working hours, I pay for my Internet addiction.
I never thought it would be this hard to create an iPad app.
You weren't gone long.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I can't get down in town.
At least it wasn't boring.
Can you freeze it down?
Tom blinked with the headlight.
Are you threatening me?
Tom's worried.
I used to like coming here.
This isn't a fish.
Maybe Tom and Mary didn't do what everyone said they did.
There's no one here who's called that.
It's time to go.
All three men smiled.
Come and sit down.
It has to do.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.
My chainsaw is broken.
You think she's handsome, huh?
He lived a simple life.
This is gonna take years.
I spelled the word wrong.
I don't like this book.
A octopus has ten arms.
She didn't come before two.
I am.
That was very good.
Come and talk to me.
He took care of the baby.
Leave me alone!
I would never have seen such a peaceful vision.
Tom's fast.

Unfortunately, Tom left.
What is the difference between American and British English?
I'll read the book.
I did the wedding cake.
Use a scalpel, not an axe.
Could you write down the link to that site?
She enclosed a photo.

Where is she?
It feels really good.
Why do you like it?
What would you say if you were in this situation?
Give me three weeks.
The driver turned the steering wheel to the right.
I'm on the wind.
Tom said he didn't eat meat.

Not really.
You don't even like chocolate.

Are they in love with each other?
What's your favorite snack restaurant?

I'm in a bad mood.
Tom can't stand up.
Maybe you don't watch TV that much?
It'll have to wait.
He said he doesn't know.
What caused the power outage?
Tom hung up on Mary.
It looked fun.
Was this wall built to keep people out or to keep them inside?
It's 7:00.
Where are the satellites?
Do you play golf?
I'll take care of it.

How's it going?
I'm just kidding you.
That's funny.
Are you unhappy, Tom?
In general, I agree with you.
Tom was discussing the problem with Mary.
Are you staying at home?
Give me another nail.
You can be sure of that.
You have to move now.
She was faint.
Do I look tired?

Quick, hold this tree.
Right!

We didn't play chess much because we liked to play as to just beat the time.
Don't let him take it.

She's the one who paid me her address so that I could find her house.
All right, everybody, listen up now.
At first, I didn't know what to do.
Did you see the game?
Tom reads a book with novels.
Keep smiling.

He likes to be upset.
Me too.
Which company are you working for?
I borrowed Tom's bike.
Stay ready.
Tom's on the show.
Tom kept walking.
Come out with us.
Who danced Tom with?
I should go change.
Did you bring it?
I hope you'll appreciate the next song.
Tom could save himself.
Your right sock is out of turn.
He died young.
I wonder why Tom left.
Stay down.
How's your life as a married man?
What did all that mean?
I think you need to think about the future.
You really shouldn't drink the tap water.

Now not only words are needed, but action is also needed.
Don't touch me.
The dives found a ship wreck on the bottom of the sea.
That's all I wanted to say.
What's the problem with that?

Please close the door after you.
I don't know English.
You're weird.
A passer-by car ran in a pool of water and splashed all over me.

Have I gone crazy?
They traveled together.
We're playing hunting!
I don't agree with you on that point.
Do you have a boy or girlfriend?
What do they say?
I never wear costumes.
Is Tom drinking coffee?
They're high school students.
One of you is lying.
I have plenty of time, so can I sleep for a while?
He's always crying when he's drunk.
Can you explain what this is?
Look me in the eye, or it doesn't matter.
Don't forget there are exceptions.
My birthday is March 22nd.
Have they come yet?
We're gonna give you the house.
Tom's sick.
Go see Tom.
I can never fall in love again.
I'll do it, but on one condition.
It's just a saying.
Tom's mother died in 2013.
How was the show?
It's actually pretty common.
It's made of skin.
Tom said you were happy.
All three men smiled.
Tom's hurt.
How did you solve the problem?
This looks like harassment.
Open your mouth.
Tom can't work tomorrow.
Where's your room?
I like to have a lot to do.
They like to play in the snow.
It seems to take an eternity and three days.
Tom's fainted.

There are many old temples in Kyoto.
You're babbling.
What's his name?
Some fish can change their sex.
Hey, check this out.
Tom puts lots of sugar in his coffee.
This method is slow but safe.
Mary is my former girlfriend.
I knew that would happen.
The horse is not white.
We cannot agree with you at this point.
He'll be able to go upstairs and walk in about a week.
You should go to a doctor.
I'm pathetic.
You son of a bitch!
Do it now, Tom.
I got it at home.
Do you enjoy this?
Take it easy!
He's driving a Ferrari.
Sweden's capital is Stockholm.
Is Tom not having breakfast?
Your car's burning.
I love this car.
I know.
We should get started.

It's a month until my birthday.
Stay away from me!
You just need to be a little creative.

It's 7:00 in London now.
I feel kind of sick.
That's all we have.
Where are we going?

Can I go now?
I want to practice.
Do you want me to tell you a story?

I've had the tailor sew up a new suit for me.
I thought it was a joke.
Tom and I, we both miss you very much.
Please.
Tell me why she's crying.
It's an old manuscript.
You wouldn't enjoy it.
I'm talking to the principal.
I opened the door.
