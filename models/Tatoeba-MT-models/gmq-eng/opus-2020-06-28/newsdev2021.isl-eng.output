Biden conducts polls in three key states
When there are just 100 days of election, Joe Biden, a provocative Democrats, will take precedence in three important swinging countries.
CNN reports today that Biden was in Florida, Arizona, and Michigan.
In Florida, Bend claims 51% to follow the president.
In Arizona there is a 49%-45% Biden in favour and in Michigan is heading for Biden's superiority, which leads with 12 points, 52%-40%.
To win the elections in November, after 100 days, Trump needs to turn all these states around, and in fact more.
Trump lives up these days with a coronary epidemic that the country teaches him to an increasing extent and says that the vast majority of the respondents in the Federal Republic have responded badly, or very badly at the beginning of the epidemic.
In addition, Trump has been averted by protests and protests that sprayed up at the death of George Floyd.
It seems that Trump and his government have acted wrongly or wrongly with them.
To crown the problems of Trumps, he is now under severe criticism for having ordered federal police officers to break up protests in cities where city or state leaders are Democrats.
It has created a huge wolf’s bulge among the inhabitants of the cities, and that anger is transmitted to other Americans.
Also, pictures of FBI officers choking protesters into unmarked cars have not helped the United States cause.
Watching The Lincoln Project's ad on this particular subject, but it can be seen below.
Trump won all three states in 2016, but with very little vote.
In fact, Trump won a very large number of countries with a small vote and won the elections with a minority vote.
Michigan, for example, won him with just 10,704 votes.
It's less than 0.5% of the population.
Almost all the polls that politicians say are significant are to show the same conclusion that Biden is being made.
A new CNN in Arizona shows that the advance of Biden has now come out of the scan's margin.
So do CNN and Quinnipiac University's researchers on Florida.
Even Fox News, who leaned to the right and declared support for Trump 2016, has published research on the same subject in its media.
The last hope of the President, according to the results of the questions, that Trump might have the hope of returning to important places within the context of a shift if the attention of the election campaign is directed towards the economy.
After the Covid-19 epidemic, the U.S. economic situation hit hard, but the voters do not seem to link the economic shock to the crown virus epidemic.
In other words, the vast majority of voters seem to blame Trump for failing to respond to the crown - virus epidemic, but they trust in him better to deal with the economic shock of the state at that time.
However, Trump has failed to control the discussion in the election campaign.
Following the storms that have burned almost constantly since the news came from the video dauntingly, where four policemen killed George Floyd, Trump tried to control the debate over to the law enforcement and its importance.
Law and Orderr, became his syllable.
Now it seems to have failed altogether, as the former said.
As the polls lean more on Trump, more and more Republicans are more likely to divorce Trump and declare support for either Biden, or someone else, who is then Biden without specifically naming him.
This is because in the United States, they choose to vote in many elections on the same standard.
In this way, the elector can simply signify the second category of the election section of the ballot box, making it one thing a vote for all the other contributors to the vote.
In this way, the Republican party’s candidates in another office try to break free from the quiet Trump gang and gain independent results in the elections.
Youth Olympics in Dakar postponed to 2026
The Olympic Games of youth were scheduled to take place in Dakar next year, but they have now been postponed to 2026 because of the chronic virus epidemic after the International Committee on Olympia and Senegal agreed.
However, the delay in the first Olympics to take place in Africa is a shock to many young athletes.
A volunteer arrested for the fire in Nantes
A volunteer in the cathedral in Nantes, France, has been arrested in connection with fires that destroyed the church.
Le Monde reports that the suspected Rwandan fugitive who served as a church overseer admitted to the fire.
The man’s lawyer, in a conversation with another media, says that the man is a great observer of his actions.
Among those destroyed in the fire was an organ from the 17th century and historically designed windows of the church.
The volunteer, 39 years old and not named, was arrested shortly after the fire on July 18th, which was then released.
After that, he was returned to a report yesterday, and after that he was taken into custody.
"No way out of this."
I am well received at Baltasar’s home and Christian Samper’s home in Cópavogi.
The reason for my visit is the new Baltasar's playlist and his daughter, Mireya, who will be opened on August 1st, in the Hall of Little Kambi, on Snæfellsnesi.
Is this the first time the fathers show together.
I am brought down to Baltasar’s workplace, where great paintings look at me.
Great and dreary images of the woman in the past but also of flying creatures; eagles on one, shadows of birds on another.
The office is located in the garden of the home.
“We had a horse here with us that bit the grass, ” Baltasar says me.
“The horse works much better than the mower on these hills and hills we have. ”
Mireya is with us Christian and Baltasar, and she tells us how her work is affected by the works here.
“Introductions, a combination of paper works and a jewel of jewelry.
They're all very white and in contrast to what Dad's doing, since I'm working with the light and like that," she says.
“ It’s been a year since this idea came up.
Then there were certain tasks I was working on and wanted to show there, but they got stuck in Tokyo out of Covid.
When my dad started painting, and I saw where he was going, I rethinked my party," says Miraya, but Baltasar's work has a strong shot in Icelandic legends about women's throats and waterfalls.
“ When I saw that my dad was doing these paintings with the women, I felt that I was perfect in making jewelry associated with them, ” says Miraya, but she works with the Victory.
"That's what I'm going to do with an insertion from the jewel."
Last year, Mireya attended 72 Akademium artists at Snæfellsnesi, including the Hall of Little Kambi, and found the building fascinating.
“ It’s a new space, an old barn that’s just finished, ” says Mireya, who spoke to Baldvina Sverrisdódódur artist, who suggested that Miraya and Baltasar put up a show together.
“ She wanted us both to show, and we thought:
“ Why not?
This is a good idea."
Baltasar Samper was born in 1938 in Spain, and he attended the University of Fine Arts in Barcelona before conducting a worldwide tour of art collections and research.
He came here in Iceland in 1961 and was impressed by a land and nation.
Here again shortly thereafter, he came to know his wife, Christian, and has lived here ever since 1963, for 57 years.
Baltasar is a productive artist, has held dozens of private shows, and shows with Christians in many lands.
It is best known for its large wallpapers, such as the wall decoration of the Flat Island Church and the fresco of the Central Church.
“ What affects what I do is the bitter that Iceland has and no other place, ” says Baltasar.
“ These low suns and shadows are being stretched and stretched.
As soon as I got here, I thought, "Wow, here's work."
Miraya is the oldest children of Kristsjöna and Baltasar, born in 1964.
“ There was one thing I knew, it was quite clear, that I wasn’t going to be an artist, ” she asked if she wanted to follow her parents ’ footsteps.
“ So I went to high school and did everything I could to get away from it.
Then I realized I was running away.
Then you just have to give up," says Miraya and laugh.
As her father, she has shown in many parts of the world.
A lot in Japan, to form.
All Baltasar’s and Christian’s children have passed the art road.
“I call this virus, ” says Miraya.
"There was no way out of this."
The count of Icelandair has been in a grey area when the plane's wings were cancelled.
Minister of State for Social Affairs believes that Icelandas have been in a grey area when the Society gave up all the airflies in the middle of a basement.
Then he claims that laws that prevent firefighters from entering an apartment house will be taken to an opinion after the fire on the Brother’s City Tree.
On July 17, Icelandas took up the advice to give up all 38 aircraft that served them with the partner while the flight crew was still on the table of a state accomplice.
Branches identified whether Icelandar had the power to take these statements, and they were prepared to settle the matter before Social Court.
However, there was never an end to this, and the Icelandas gathered in bed for 24 hours after the announcements.
However, Mr. Einar Daddison’s minister for social affairs says that he remembers that Icelandair’s decision was in a grey area and was on the right pay line.
“ My view is that this is a right to defend employees.
When you're in a conversation, when you're in a consolator's room, it's not an option to go that way.
It is quite clear to me that this had not been the case.
I think it's quite clear, in my mind, that men were come into a grey area there what this touched," says Amagnition.
He will thus not speak of other companies going the same way as Icelandair.
“You are also now faced with a dangerous discussion that it is only normal to go to the top of this system to reduce this right, and that is why I am totally opposed.”
At Sprengissand this morning, Adolescent was also asked about the government’s reaction to the burning of a brotherhood step at the end of June, where three died.
The minister now states that the study of the matter is on the table of the House and of the Institute of Human Works, to which he has directed a direct recommendation.
“ It is legal today that the fire can’t enter the apartment house.
I have asked the Office for Home Affairs and Humanities to check in particular whether there is a reason to make any changes to the legislation.
I am ready to make the changes needed to reduce the likelihood that this could happen again," says Einar’s love.

United States said that pressure on Nord Stream 2 - RT Business News
The U.S. government has made further attempts to force European companies to abandon the gas pipeline project Nord Stream 2, led by Russia, according to Welt am Sonntag, which refers to people familiar with the issue.
According to the newspaper, foreign ministry officials, finance agencies, and the United States Department of Energy have contacted European companies to ensure that they are aware of the consequences of continuing the project.
Up to 12 officials should have held at least two online meetings with representatives of companies during the last days.
Those who witnessed that the talks said that the Americans had stressed that the United States wanted to prevent North Stream 2 from becoming a reality.
“I think it’s a very, very serious threat,” one said to the German media.
These threats are in line with Mike Pompeo, U.S. Foreign Minister, last week, when he warned that companies involved in the project would be best to “come out now” or be at risk of punishment according to 232 parts of the notorious law of the Country’s Adventures Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
In addition to the Russian energy player Gazprom, who supervises the development of the project, five European companies take part in it.
These are the French company Engie, OMV from Austria, the British Dutch company Royal Dutch Shell plus Winter Hall and Uniper from Germany.
In a conversation with Welt am Sonntag, the representative of the last company mentioned said that attempts by the United States to undermine "a major internal project" would be a clear intervention in the European Union.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Council approved an amendment to the law on land protection intended to extend the United States penalty measures against companies involved in the installation of the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
According to one of the transporters of the bill, the provisions may be aimed at companies that provide services for ships, insurance, refusals or communication services for such ships, as well as those who offer a witness to Nord Stream 2.
Both European companies and government officials have repeated their disapproval of the efforts of the United States to share European energy by using penalties against Nord Stream 2, and some have even called for Brussels to work for countermeasures.
Moscow officials have also criticized Washington’s action and called it unfair competition.
Earlier this week, the president’s spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, said that Russia would come up with a new plan on how the project will be completed if the Washington executives were to put the new penalty measures under stress.
Preparing for further transfer of public institutions to the country
The Minister for Social Affairs and the Committee of the Regions intends to move more public institutions to the country in the near future.
The Brunavarna area of the Department of Housing and Humanity will be moved north of the Gulf of Saudi Arabia in the fall of the Secretary's decision, but the experts in the department have previously declared that they do not intend to move to the North.
Einar Daddeson, Minister for Social Affairs and Children's Affairs, said in Sprengisand at the Belle this morning that it is important for the countryside that public institutions are transferred there.
It follows a great creation of value, which also creates diversity.
“ It’s nationally important, we’re trying to build everything around here around the country.
Job-building, currency-building, whether in the tourism sector, agriculture, industry, any kind of natural utility, and this kind of public service, they are very good supporters of that structure," says Agriculture.
“Produces increased diversity, creates better support for this resource use and the formation of the nation’s currency. ”
The decision on the transfer of the tannery range of the Office for Home Affairs and Humanities has been strongly criticized by its employees and by the National Association of Disarmaments and Medical Carriers.
Six men who have expertise in burns and work in the department are all living in the capital city, and none of them are going to move their livestock to the corner of the sheep.
“I think it’s very clear that whether it’s politically different how hard to deal with this.
My opinion is, and it has always been, that we are going to engage in radical measures to distribute the public service better," says Anoyance.
“We see that our neighbouring nations, the Norwegians and the Danes have been doing this successfully.”
He claims to be convinced that the vast majority of the people want to see more distribution in public institutions around the country.
"I think we need to make further political decisions about the transfer of public services to the country, as I was doing with the House and Humanities Agency."
He considers the transfer of food agencies at Selfoss, Iceland’s Lands to Akraness, and unemployment insurance on the Skagaststrand.
“ It’s a place of work on Skagaststrand today that is of great importance to that society.
I think we should take further steps into this being."
“I’m preparing further steps for this creature.
More transfer."

A Doctor ran 35 kilometers with a mask
The British doctor, Tom Lawton, ran over 35 miles [35 km] of days with a face mask to show that oxygen saturation did not decrease with the use of facial masks.
Lawton's a doctor at Bradford Royal Hospital, and he's been working there while the pandemic's gone.
In order to avoid the theory of oxygen saturation and to encourage people to wear a face mask, Lawton decided to run back and forth with a mask.
Before leaving, he set up a collection of GoFundMe for The Trusell Trust, who provides food supplies in Bradford and in many parts of Britain.
“ I’m a great supporter of everything that keeps us safe.
That's why I've been shocked by the wrong information that's been passed on between people, that's why the face mask reduces the oxygen saturation in people," said Lawton.
Lawton said that he had previously competed in trifle, but while the pandemic had gone off his back.
On Monday last Monday, he ran the mileage of 35.
“ I never took off my mask (no food or drink) and the oxygen saturation turned 98% on every look, ” wrote Lawton on Twitter at the end.

Gottlieb warns that society's chronic spread of the crown virus makes it "very difficult" to open schools in the fall
Washington — Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former director of the United States Food and Drug Control, warned that it will be “very difficult” for schools to open up in a new year of study if the crown virus spreads freely within these communities.
“ I believe that local authorities need to examine the distribution within the community.
If the virus spreads unobstructedly in the community, it becomes very difficult to open in that state," said Gottlieb in the “Face the Nation”.
Since the autumn is due to begin in the next few weeks, the government of Trump had encouraged school authorities to open up their schools to students and offer lessons at school five days a week.
However, these attempts by President Trump and the High Minister of Education, Betsy DeVos, will arrive a week after Trump warned that the Cronine virus epidemic would probably “wrong before he gets better” and confirmed that school districts in those places where the worst situation might have to delay school opening for a few weeks.
Nevertheless, on Thursday, DTCs published guidance on how to make school the safest way for students.
This guide calls for the removal of people, students, and staff from school to be advised to use facial protection and to divide students into distinct groups to reduce the rate of transmission.
However, protection centers did not set out criteria for school officials on when to close schools if coronary virus infestations are increasing, as Gottlieb says, have been “unlucky. ”
“ When this uncertainty prevails and detailed instructions have not been given as to how the schools will be opened, I think more parents will be careful, ” he says.
“This is why I think it is very important to get detailed information on which standards are exactly what the protection centers did not provide in their guidance.”
Gottlieb told schools to think about the rate of positive infection in the community, local spread, and testing skills when deciding whether schools should be kept open or switched to online teaching.
If between 5 and 10% of the tests, a positive result is “gets to be troubled” but more than 10% is “the threshold for careful consideration of whether to close school sentences”.
“ This is a sign that the journey has reached its foothold in the community, ” said Gottlieb, adding that this would make things of Florida, which is the center of the crown virus epidemic in the United States, difficult to open up for school teaching in the next month.
In more than 30 countries, the number of Coronavirus infestations has increased, while in the Middle East of the U.S. Sunbed, the center of the epidemic is known as the southern coast.
However, Gottlieb said that there was evidence of a slowing of the rise in the number of cases in some countries, including Arizona and Texas.
However, despite the fact that Gottlieb had said that it was “a clear sign” that the epidemic was slowing down in some countries in the solar belt, the coals in others, including South Carolina, Alabama, Indiana, and Illinois, are being heated.
Many governors have laid down rules that oblige people to use masks in public space and stop the transition to the spread of the crown virus.
Gottlieb said that it should be considered to close bars, limit the number of people in restaurants, close cinemas, and other places that offer indoor entertainment, and lay down rules on masking in order to overcome the epidemic, which is an action that enables countries to avoid retaking back the strict restrictions set at the beginning of the epidemic in March.
In addition to the use of masks by various states, various companies have required people to use facial defenses.
Dr. McDonald's fast-bitter is the latest company to make use of facial defenses and to add them to a group of companies like Walmart, Starbucks and others who have set their own rules on masking.
Gottlieb said that he expected more companies to take up a mask obligation with him, especially where the risk is considered high.
“ If we can really control the epidemic when the winter takes place until we get a vaccine or some kind of treatment that changes the clinical process of this disease then we can do it with masks, it’s relatively simple, something that we can all do, but that doesn’t change our life and allow us to keep what’s very important to us, like keeping some companies open and bringing the kids back to school,” he says.
Despite the fact that Donald Trump has not said that he wanted to make mask use of the entire country, he urged the Americans last week to use facials and said at the White House press conference that “they have an influence. ”
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson: "There's a lot of time to expect."
In the summer when Roy Hodgson, the director of the community, declared that the parishor of Wilf Zaha wanted to leave the company, the Crystal Palace audience was struck.
The elephant has played at Selhurst Park for more than five years and now seems to be leaving, but he has previously been termed a team such as Arsenal and Bayern Munich.
Since he is now 27 years old, he will find out whether a member of that quality group is still willing to pay for him high numbers, especially at the financial uncertain times of the sport this summer, after a period in which Zaha cut four boundaries and made five positions for the Palace team that caused some disappointment.
In an interview with Alex Crook at TalkSport after the last season, Hodgson said that “the news was to be expected” about the possible departure of Zaha after confirming that the respondent had“ made a clear contribution” that he would see his future elsewhere than with his partner.
Three years later, the parisher’s contract with Palace, and last year, the Society indicated that 100 million sterling barrels would need to be used to make his partner sound.
The Hodgson Team ended the seven - loss period in a row and a constant on the last day of the period, which led to the team falling to 14th place.
Zaha found the net mash only once from mid - December to the end of the long - shot period against Chelsea.
It was reported that he had asked for a sale last summer when he tried to get out of his partner, but no offer was made to tempt Palace to sell.
Zaha changed his agent in January, apparently to increase his chances of leaving the union, and in the next few weeks, he will no doubt have priority in ensuring social change.
Zaha is the player who played most minutes in the English selection department for the Palace during the period and was the only player of the team under 28 who played 1,100 minutes or more, showing how much rebuilding the team might be necessary with the funds available to the player.
Hurricane Hannah: The Korean virus-crying Texas state faces a great risk of a disaster flood in a “double shell”
Weather reports have prophesied “disasters ” in southern Texas after the hurricane Hannah reached a land twice, bringing great rain and wind up to 40 meters [40 m] a second.
When he reached the beach on Saturday, he was classed as the first phase storm (bottom score of five points) and he has now been brought down to the tropical storm, but rain could still reach 150-300 mm on Sunday and the wind could reach 26 meters per second.
In some areas, rain has already reached 230 mm, including the Cameron County at the Mexican border.
Hannah was the first hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean in 2020, and the weather scientist Chris Birchfield advised residents to be on guard: “This is not nearer to completion, but we are still expecting disasters. ”
In the last few weeks, Texas has been experiencing a major increase in chorus virus transmission.
The governor Greg Abbott published a disaster report to 23 congregations on the way of the storm, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston, and Brazoria.
“ All hurricanes are a huge challenge.
This challenge is complex and even more difficult, as the hurricane goes through an area that has become the worst in the world because of COVID-19," said Greg.
The hurricane first arrived at the land at 17:00 p.m. on Saturday, 24 miles north of Port Mansfield, which is about 210 miles south of Corpus Christi.
The second time was not far away, in the east of Kennedy County.
More than 43,700 people in South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Brownsville, were without electricity on Saturday night.
A Corpus Christi emergency service set up gardens close to the street points to be used in case of flooding over the streets.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, said that the government was watching Hannah and Hurricane Douglas, heading for Hawaii in the Pacific.
Sherry Boehme, who lives at the shores of Corpus Christi, said that the storm approaching had increased the anxiety she felt for the pandemic.
The 67 - year - old woman had mostly stayed home because of health problems associated with chronic lung disease.
She said: “It’s almost like a double hit for us.
I think a lot of people have become weak.
We'll get through this.
It's all good and strong and it's all together."

In some cases, the weather has been beneficial to farmers in South Africa.
Most people are already at first slaughter, another beat is widely started, and then it is estimated that at the end of the summer, some will get the third slaughter.
The weather has been playing with southern farmers, such as other inhabitants of the country during the summer, and it does not spoil the springs on the barrels of farmers.
Hey, there's been a good time.
The victory of Augustust son, a cohabitant in Birtingahhol, in the horoscope of Höruna, and a workman in the hoarse spirit, is all right and happy.
“ Yes, it’s just gone very well, I think farmers just have to be steep, it’s been a nice walk, and it’s been a very good weather for the last two and a half months.
Heyin is very good end crop good and good haymen nicely over," says Sigurd.
A winner says that it is growing, especially in cows, that they fall into flat pits or protrusions, which have been given very well, but it is much more important to do in the roll - hearing.
“ It’s lively, yes, yes, it’s actually been very comfortable now for the last two or two months or three weeks, it’s been so dry and good, and it’s so comfortable to deal with it.
It remembers everything, it's less stress and can be kept until morning sometimes what could be done today, so it's brilliantly comfortable.
But is it true that some farmers will strike three times?
“ Yes, I could believe it, those who were the first.
We started on June 17th, it might be that those who were the first to take three times something."

The Sun reports this.
In Wolves vs. Crystal Palace, the paramedics had something on their shoulders at Traoré.
“ This is something we had to do to protect Traoré, ” says a source within Wolves, but what was being applied to him was baby oil.
“ Making him a sleigh makes defenders more difficult to intervene, and so we can prevent further injury. ”
Traoré’s shoulders first fell off when Wolves played against Tottenham in December.
Since then, the shoulder has fallen from the team four times, now last against Sheffield United earlier this month.
Reports of Prince Harry England: A friend of the duke of Sussex protests statements in a new book that has been between the teeth of people
Stott said in a conversation with Sky News that the contents of the book on Harry Prince and Meghan Markle were in no difference from the content of the gossip magazines, the only difference being that the book was enclosed.
The former soldier wants eyes to be more focused on the positive things that he and his wife have done, such as their charitable work.
Stott said: “I don’t think what it says in any way is different from what we read in the gossip magazines, except now in an enclosed book. ”
“There’s a storytelling, but it’s not certain that this has come from them. ”
"I think it's just another attack on them, like the gossip magazines that persecute them."
“I realize they are in the field light, and people want to know what they’re doing, but I wish it would be more about all the good things they’ve done and their charity work, rather than their personal affairs.”
“ Of course, they never get away with it, for their own reason. ”
The duke’s support and the duke of Sussex overshadowed another member of the royal family, according to an expert in the history of the royal family.
Kate Williams told Sky News that the royal family had failed to make use of Harry Prince and Meghan Markle’s horoscopes.
She added that the rule of power within the royal family was firmly established, but the importance of public interest could not be controlled.
She also said: “The fact is, everything they did in support of the queen tends to overshadow another member of the royal family, and this was considered to be a problem. ”
"They're very popular."
“They had a smaller wedding, but most siblings in the same position, Andrew had a huge wedding, Anne also had a huge wedding. ”
“But while the wedding of Harry and Meghan was smaller than in Vilhálm and Katrina, the news of it was just as much, because of the great interest of the community in the couple.”
Donald Trump admits that he often regrets his voice on Twitter
Donald Trump has admitted that he often regrets his records on Twitter that fuel war.
In an interview with Barstool Sports on Friday, the president of the United States said that his uninspected reorganizations on Twitter entries — some of which have contained material from the white race — made him the most trouble.
When journalist Dave Portnoy asked him if he noticed his records, Trump replied: “Although, too often.
It was like that in the old days, before this came, that you wrote a letter and said that this letter was very big.
You put it on your desk, and then you came back the next day and said, “Oh, how glad I am that I am not sending this, right?
But we don't do it with Twitter.
We send it out right away, we feel great, and then you start getting calls — “Did you really say this? ”
I say, "What's wrong with this?" and you'll find out."
Last month, Trump caused a lot of anger after reproducing a record (shared material from another account) with a video of his supporters in the Villages area of Florida, where elderly couples called "White Power!" or "chosen Whites".
And in 2017, Trump re-created three entries directed against Muslims, published by Jaydu Fransen, the leader of the Left-Right Opt.
The president told Portnoy that the improvements that had made him the most trouble
Trump said: “You see something that looks good and doesn’t examine it, you understand, and you don’t know exactly what’s on your helmet, which is small and you don’t grow it, sometimes — I’ve found out that it’s almost always the repair that gets you in trouble. ”
The president often shares praise to his own people, a message about his opposers, and conspiracy teachings with his 80 million followers on Twitter.
Trump says Twitter helps him to get through the so - called “fals ” on television programs and newspapers, which he says is pervaded by untruth.
However, the President’s own lies have often been the subject of the microscope, and now Trump’s Twitter records are misleading.
The GPS system may be insecure
Many states are working to develop a different location technique than the GPS system.
The engineer says that there may be reasons to worry about the security of the GPS system, which is in the possession of the U.S. Army.
The old Loran system has been revitalizing life days.
GPS technology comes with us every step of the way.
We use it when we fly, sail, and drive, when we land, in industry, and in leisure time.
Most people do not think of it as a military tool in the possession of the U.S. Army, which first opened it to public use in the 1980 ’ s.
GPS technology uses satellite coordinates at a height of 20,000 miles above the ground, so conditions in nature have little influence on it.
“ But it is very easy to disturb her.
And malicious people can easily interfere with the reception of these signals," says Sæmund E. Torsteinsson, a lecturer in engineering at the University of Iceland and a specialist in risk management and communications security.
He also says that it is easy to send a false signal with a wrong location, such as in warfare.
“ The GPS system is in the hands of the U.S. Department of Defence.
They have assured the public that the system is ready at all times.
But certainly they can turn this off if it plunged into the head of a very special president to have him do it, then he could probably do it," says Saemundur.
Thus, many countries are taking into account other systems and location technologies.
Both Russian and Chinese operate their own satellite system, and the European Union is pushing Galileo into its location system.
“ The Gallileo system is primarily built for civil use.
It may be more accurate and naturally controlled by the European Union.
Then it is not one government that completely controls it, but many," says Saemon.
But many are also looking back to the old loran technique.
It's based on radio waves and was used from the 1960s until GPS technology took over.
The "Loran" signs are sent on very long waves from the sent down on the ground.
“ It is then a new version of the “ELoran, ” which stands for the Enhanced Loran, that is, serious to consider in many countries having it as a warning system, for it is somewhat different to interfere with it, it is far more difficult than to interfere with a satellite satellite system, ” says Samundur.
However, it is probably the safest thing to have access to as much as possible.
An experienced Senator Vern Buchanan, dead from the crown virus
“Gary was a professional in a fingertip and a loyal servant of the public, ” said Buchanan on Facebook.
“ He touched so many lives and was loved and admired by those who knew him.
I will never forget how uplifting he was, the sense of humor, and the extraordinary joy he had from helping others."
Buchanan’s office published a statement in the early months of the month, stating that the Tibbetts had no recent dealings with others in the office.
Tibbetts, who worked outside the office, had worked for Buchanan since 2011.
Florida has reported 414.511 cases since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 411,200 in New York City, according to public health authorities in the countries.
The data of the state’s health authorities show that hospitalization has increased by 79% since the U.S. National Day, July 4.
The data also shows that at least 50 ICUs in Florida reached the threshold on Saturday.
“ We informed them that this might have an impact, ” said Desantis in June.
"At the same time, police work and putting charges into this could have the opposite effect."
A flight from Hornavard to Cape Town
Twirl doves, roses, ring doves, crossovers, glistmas, and weeps are among the birds that have been intertwined to land this summer.
In the Web of Birds Viewing Centers of Southeast Birds, we can almost daily see brief news about the convents, where they have been seen, and sometimes their genders.
There are many of them in Iceland.
To this end, you will find the number of people who like Facebook page Icelandic bird species.
The group’s members are about 14,600.
There are divided pictures of birds and it is obvious that Iceland is rich in good photographers who have the patience needed to form birds.
The son of Brynjelf is one of them.
The bin, as it is called, is the servant of the bird observation centers of the south-east and the Naturtur of the south-east, and is closely watching the bird’s life in that area.
He speaks beautifully of these animals that enrich the life of Iceland and play an important role there, and it doesn’t matter whether the bird is a large and large bird or a small sparrow.
The birds observation center was set up in 2005 on the birthday of Halfdán Björnsson, in the Czech Republic, with the aim of maintaining the air and continuing the significant natural research he carried out since 1940.
“ Half-life was thirteen years old when he began to study information about birds, ” says Brynjelf in a conversation with Kjarnen.
“We at the bird inspection station are not doing exactly what Halfdán did but are building on his data by counting and marking birds.”
Half-dead was a farmer and a common scientist, born March 14, 1927.
He wrote a number of scientific articles about plants, insects, and bird life.
He died on February 10, 2017, almost 90 years old.
Half - dead brothers and sisters in the Czech Republic were interested in many people whom they met in Icelandic nature.
In that group, Björn Gisli Anarson, “the worker, ” is the Bird Inspection Station.
Bear grew up in Reyki Squares in South Africa, and he had a rich natural shrine with his neighbor, Half-daughter, in the Czechs.
What, though, is the action of the Birds View Center in South-Easterland?
On March 20, each year, the Birds View Station will set up a special bird’s seat in Einar-sluttering, twirling a dose inside the Cape of Hörnavard.
It contains standard markings for the birds that come in the nets.
The nets are taken down around May 10, when the varptime begins.
The nets are up all day, at least from about six o’clock in the morning until noon.
And they have to visit every hour.
The birds in it are marked, measured, and then released back into freedom.
Every hour, a journalist of the wonder asks.
“ Yes, we share this with us, me and Bjssi.
Since we now have to work for ourselves, this can be a considerable puzzle game, but somehow we will succeed in doing this," says Brynjelf.
The network is then restored from August 1st to November 10th — all days allowed by weather.
Between the networks and the periods they are not living, Brännjelf and Bjorn are marking the kriries, twilights, and various moths where they reach them.
In addition, they take on various special projects.
One of these tasks is being worked together with Iceland’s National Institute of Natural Sciences, and it’s about gathering forest ticks from birds.
“ The woodmallows jump on the birds in their winter stations and then take them to the country in the spring.
This happens shortly before they leave, so these ticks are not big when they arrive in Iceland.
Then he jumps off the bird and tries to find himself some other host when he needs it."
But enough about the tickles.
A question about how the birds in South-Easterland did it this summer, Bränjelf says that the tree’s laying seems to be going well — where it is going over the head of the pit.
“ There is Hala in the South and everything is going well.
But there is nothing to be found anymore by Jakul's yearlon, where a few years ago there was a huge lay."
He says that a few years ago, over a thousand carnivores have been scraped there, but they can now be counted on the fingers of another hand.
“ When we look at mottling birds, I feel that it has been reduced in the last few years what you feel about them.
But there's always a change between years."
What can explain that great change, according to Brännjolf, is likely to be the source of food.
"It's all about food."
Then humans can also have their work to say about the outcome of birds and other animals.
However, some birds seem to be doing a lot of good in South-Easterland this summer.
“One of the things that I think positive is that it is increasing again after a great fall, ” says Brynjelf, “but during the last few years and decades the shadows have fallen. ”
Of sparrows, it is reported that it seems that the marine will be doing well in the summer as in the past.
The thugs and duvets had reduced somewhat, but Brännjelf says it will not reveal until in the fall how this summer has been theirs.
But let's get back to the clashes.
Often they attract great attention, especially if they are very few and even colorful.
The two most interesting features are about one of the most popular clashes in the summer: The Rose Star.
“It’s been relatively calm in the summer of the clashes, ” says Brynjelf, but it mentions that there’s now a cry in the country, and the ring doves have been seen and are beginning to lay down here.
When Brännjelf and Bjorn get in close proximity, they also label them, as do other birds.
Marks are international, and they are being practiced worldwide.
For example, the weather stations of birds, where they lay, and their journeys, can be identified in various ways.
“ It is even possible to see how long they are on a flight, ” says Brynjelf.
This information is useful in many ways, to form when epidemics such as a bird’s fluorine occur.
"It's always being more knowledge."
If anyone in the world finds a bird that has been marked by the National Birds Survey Center in Southeast, the information is sent to Iceland’s National Institutes.
“We’ve been restored from Cape Town in South Africa.
There was a pot we had marked.
One of us was found later in the United States."
One bird is a bridesmaid especially the mind, and it is the screen.
“ The cloud is our bird, ” he says, pointing out that the Birds Viewing Station and the Nature Hall of his South-Eastern country are assigned to observe his outcome — which has become quite a flame, and now he has come to the end of his life.
It is difficult to claim what has caused a collapse in the foundation, but the only theory is that the cloud has made its previous seabed good, which had been thrown out of the submarines and into the sea, rather than using it much better, and it has an impact on the cloud.
Are you in the best spot in the country to watch birds?
“ You’re not going to make me say no, ” says the Wreck of the Wreck, adding: “Because we’re now also following a conjugal bird, we may have to go in many places. ”
Yet, when it comes to bird’s life, the southeastern country is a special place.
“ This area is like a trait into the country from Europe, but then the birds are scattered from here.
To be here is a very interesting view of birds, but there is less to be found in birds than in many other parts of the country.
It is not far from a distance and to an glacier, so that the area as such is well suited for the sighting of birds."
But does Brynjelf have a favorite bird?
He will think for a short while before answering.
I think the question's hard.
“ I have found nine of the ten that have been seen in the land, ” he answers.
“ I think it’s even more fun to take pictures of horrors.
It's always fun to find birds that haven't been seen before in this country or are rare, so I'm not talking about finding a new species for Europe."
But that is what both of them have been doing with Binni and Bjøssi.
If you would like to monitor the work of Benna and Bjössa at the Avian Observatory in South-Eastern Sweden, you can watch their work on Facebook and on the Birds website.is
Saudi Arabia — The Sun Coast of the Future? No Alcohol or bikini
In recent years, the tourism industry has grown vastly in many parts of the world, and now the Saudi Arabian authorities want their share of the cake.
Consider the government’s spending of some $60,000 billion to make a tourist paradise in the country.
The Guardian reports this.
But this tourist paradise will not be in the style that Iceland and I are to get used to in southern Europe.
Alcohol will not be available, and women will not be allowed to sun themselves in bikini.
How, then, should travelers be lured to this hard - hearted Islamic land?
This is to be done, for example, by building a new city where white beaches, moons (of course made by men), dragon trucks, and robots serving people.
The Guardian says it's Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who wants to invest in this investment.
Of course, the money will be taken from the oil waste of the land.
The Crown says that it is not a question that women can let go of their shoulders and knees in public places, but at the same time admit that it is not a simple matter to create a tourist paradise in the country because it is too hot when the sun is high and it is not possible to rely on a winddown.
But it may well be wondered if it will not also reduce the interest of prospective tourists if they are unable to buy alcohol.
Francois Bozize, previously cast by the Presidential Court of the Central African Republic, reports on Presidential mission
The former president of the Central African Republic, Francois Bozize, who had been cast by a chair, announced on Saturday that he would be presenting himself in the presidential elections in December, despite the fact that he was being punished by the United Nations and that an arrest order was issued because of his alleged crimes against humanity.
He announced his commission in front of a large group of supporters at his party council, Kwa na Kwa (“work only, work”), in the capital city of Bangui.
This 73 - year - old general and general was deprived in 2013 in the rebellion of an ally, mostly Muslim rebels from the north, who plunged the nation into the majority of Christians, into violent civil war, and serious and long - lasting humanitarian clash.
“The country needs a man with experience, peace and conviction,” said Bozize in a talk that was criticized during the current president’s term of office, Faustin-Archange Touadera.
Bozize first took office after a military attack in 2003 and held Presidential office for 10 years before he fled the country in 2013.
The new government sought to arrest him for alleged crimes against mankind and to encourage genocide, but he has not been arrested since his return from exile in the late last year.
It is not clear how the arrest order or foreign punishment affect its delivery.
In January, Bozize said that he would ask the United Nations to abolish the sanctions imposed in 2014 due to alleged support for armed Christian groups of anti-Balaka.
Touadera is in charge of the country today, with the support of a comprehensive UN peacekeeping mission, which counts as more than 13,000 military and police officers.
He was elected in 2016 and is expected to offer himself for a period of a year that has not been confirmed.
The first round of elections will be December 27.
In February 2019 the government signed a peace agreement with 14 armed groups that generally claim to defend the interests of certain communities or religions.
Since then, violent crime has decreased, but it is still a bloody incident that is most often caused by resource conflicts, but the majority of this diamond - rich country is not under the control of the government.
Violence has forced more than 1.5 million people to flee their homes.
Gareth Bale's position at Real Madrid is "unacceptable for everyone", says Toni Kroos
Toni Kroos, middle man Real Madrid, says the position of Gareth Bale in the Spanish team is “unacceptable to everyone”.
Bale took no part in any of the last seven team games, and he took a small part in the LaLiga celebration of Los Blancos, and this summer it has come up that the player intends to stay and let his contract run out, but the partner hopes that he will leave.
“There’s no way to avoid situations becoming unacceptable to everyone,” said Kroos on the Lauschangeriff Endlich was my Sport.
“ He was not bought to play him as little as he is now.
I think he really wanted to leave the club last summer and that the company actually said "yes" and then said "no" later.
I don't know if he's still a little angry about it.
When asked if the situation had had a negative impact on Real’s atmosphere, Kroos said: “Not as much as possible.
I've known him for six years, and we've been doing important things together."
China gives Reykjamesby 2,000 faces to support the fight against the crown virus
The ambassador of China, Jin Zhijian, handed over the town of Reykjane to two thousand faces in the past week.
The occasion was the visit of the mayor to the Chinese embassy on July 22, last.
News reports reported first.
The mayor’s visit was to pay back the Chinese ambassador’s visit to Reykjanesby, where he visited the town council and met with the mayor.
The Víkir news reports that they discussed the strengthening of friends' cooperation between the City of Reykjanes and the City of Xianyang, but the municipalities began their cooperation between 2014.
The gift, 2,000 faces, is to be rooted in this friendship, but the Xianyang city authorities wanted to give masks and thus support the fight against the crown virus epidemic.
News reports that the masks will be used in the sensitive facilities and in the establishments of Reykjanetown for both employees and other visitors there.
In addition to the flages of Iceland and the People’s Republic of China, the accompanying picture shows an inscription on the masked face box, which says “Everyone is behind, except for his brother. ”
Thomsen wants to leave KR - Calculates by reducing the salary
Tobias Thomsen is going to try to get home to Denmark, from Iceland’s C.R., next month, and he says he feels interest from his peers in the Danish 1st Division.
Thomsen has been playing in Iceland since 2017 and has become Iceland’s champion with both Val and KR.
On the other hand, this 27 - year - old visitor says that he is missing Danmerk and wants to move there with his girlfriend, Stephen Jacob’s daughter.
Danan’s deal with KR is valid until the end of this season, so it is clear that a Danish society would have to negotiate with KR a purchase price to get it in August, before the start of a new season in Denmark.
Otherwise, Thomsen would have to wait until winter to reach Denmark.
“ Yes, I know that the Danish divisions start again at the end of August.
That, of course, means that I had to break my deal with KR-inga, but I've told them I'm missing Danmerk, and they're fully aware of it," said Thomsen to ball.dk.
He added that he had a very good relationship with a coach named Rúnar Kristonsson, who had shown his full understanding, and Thomsen said that he did not believe that the price would be a big problem.
“ I’ve also had conversations with two 1st divisions after that division was completed and I knew where they would end.
There has already been some interest in the coming period, so it may well be that I go to Denmark before the Icelandic branch ends," said Thomsen but added that it was clear that there were not many companies in Denmark who could buy his deal with KR.
“ It’s not very clear now, but it’s been an interest.
I also need to find the best chance for me and my girlfriend, who is from Iceland and who comes with me.
This depends on a few things," said Thomsen, saying, "Looking primarily to the Copenhagenans.
Thomsen told KR-enem not to worry that he wouldn't give himself everything in practice and games, even if he didn't miss Danmerk.
“ KR knows what it gets from me, and I do things 100 percent.
I can quite overlook the fact that I miss Danmerk when I'm on exercises or in games," said Thomsen, who says he's going to lower his salary to leave Iceland's Masters in the next department of Denmark.
“ I’m probably going to have to drop just on the paycheck, out of the crown virus crisis that seems to have tripped the Danish communities a little more than the Icelandic ones.
But I am also studying, and one solution might be that a company provided me with a job.
The majority of the associates in the 1st department have an agreement with the sponsors.
I'm learning sports management through the game organization and I'm finishing the bachelor degree," said Thomsen.
Thomsen has only been in the beginning of KR in two games in the Pepsi Max Division during this season, but she has a history of five games and scored one goal.
He started 21 games for the last year and scored seven.
KR is just as choice to the top of the Pepsi Max division as well as to the top of the game, but the team will meet KA at Akureyri today.
Dealing with the crown virus aboard the bus, driver is in hot argument about the face mask.
The video shows passengers and drivers on board an Arriva bus in Liverpool.
The driver says to a woman that it is not in his business to tell passengers to use a mask.
The driver said: “It is not in my business to tell everyone who comes up to the bus using a mask. ”
A Witness said of the incident: “A man and an older woman began to approach her, and a great fight broke out. ”
“ The driver had to leave his seat and came to ask what was really going on, and he told one woman that she wasn’t even using the mask correctly. ”
“ That woman then pulled off the bus and said she was going to report the incident. ”
Arriva’s spokesperson said: “The security of our customers and our employees is still ahead of us.
“Our clients have the obligation to use masks when using public transport (exceptions apply).”
“For customer information and labelling, and all other remote rules are on-board buses, on community networks and on our website.”
A mask obligation has been in force in public transport since June 15.
More than 16.3 COVID-19 cases have been detected worldwide.
More than 650,000 have died.
More than 9,900,000 people have recovered from the global crown virus.
Most COVID-19 cases have been detected in the United States, or more than 4.3 million.
Octavia Spencer calls for Hollywood to hire people with disability more often
The actress participates in a new effort to increase the participation of people with disabilities in the recreation sector.
The campaign is in progress at the same time as 30 years has passed since the U.S. Law on the Rights of People with Disabilities, which holds up on Sunday.
In the video, Spencer discusses the importance of seeing themselves and their lives reflected in a real way on the screen.
“ Nothing can replace personal experience and genuine presentations, ” she says.
"That's why it's so important that you hire an appropriate actor to play an appropriate role."
Spencer spoke of the effects she experienced from seeing black people on the screen when she was a little girl watching the "Good Times" part.
The features shown at CBS between 1974 and 1979 were designed by Norman Lear, and they routed the road as the first cogs that showed two parents of both African origin.
An organization against hunger will push Yoho aside after an incident in the House of Congress
WASHINGTON (AP) – An independent Christian organization that wants to end hunger said on Saturday that they had asked Senator Ted Yoho to resign from the organization, and that he had become so, as they called “aggression” on Senator Alexandri Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio-Cortez, a senator of Democrats in New York, accused Mr Yoho, the Senator of the Republican Republicans of Florida, of using a low-curly and male-refunctory hordes when they met in the courts last Monday.
Yoho claimed that he had not used the words quoted, but a reporter who witnessed the incident confirmed that the expression was as she described it.
Bread for the World stated in a statement that the government of the Sami had met Yoho on Friday and agreed that he would resign to “justify our commitment to be with women and men of darkness, domestic and world-wide, which leads us towards a world of increased participation in all races and increased justice.”
On their “co - Christian voice ” website Bread for the World, the council and government are pressured to end hunger in the land and worldwide.
“ Since Bread for the World is independent of a Christian organization that has the objective of reducing hunger and poverty with sound public policies, the organization maintains the respect, dignity, and concern that Jesus asks us to show when we are dealing with people in positions of power, wherever it is on the political spectrum, ” states the Declaration.
“Our opinion reflects the recent activities and words of Senator Ted Yoho, reported in the media, not the moral standards of our government. ”
During the work of the news, Yoho’s spokesperson had not responded to an e - mail with an invitation to respond.
In an incredible speech at the House of Congress last Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez was dramatic in her speech against what she called a male insult, “consenting violence and violent expression against women. ”
More than a dozen of her associates accepted her statement that the incident was an example of far too common male behavior.
Yoho described the incident as a brief discussion on policy and that “no one had been bothered, put in isolation or attacked. ”
He said that he regrets having shown “happy attitude. ”
The 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez is in her first period as a prominent senator and she has received both praise and praise for her cleanness.
The 65 - year - old Yoho is one of the most conservative congressmen of the Council of Representatives and will sit on a sacred stone after his fourth reign.
Wait till 98 minutes in the premises to score the first goal of the season
Jesse Lingard had not scored or posted in the English selection department during this season, until he challenged Leicester today in a 98 - minute final session of the department.
Lingard had not scored in the English selection department since he scored twice against Cardiff in December 2018.
He came in today as a spare for Manchester United when Leicester was assigned to play the finals on Master's Department Seat.
When over seven minutes were over the usual playtime, Lingard picked up the ball by Kasper Schmeichel goalman Leicester and scored to the empty market.
Long term goal for Jesse Lingard.
Players Real Madrid Exceptional Rules
Zinedine Zidane and his disciples in Real Madrid will be able to reach England in their second game at Manchester City, in the European Masters Department, without having to go for two weeks.
The British government has decided that tourists from Spain need to go for a two - week break in order to prevent the spread of the crown virus.
However, there are exceptions, such as in the case of high - level athletes.
This confirmed the Ministry of Sport with Sky Sports.
The Ministry says that the persons who are excluded will only be in restricted areas, at a closed door.
This applies to sports stars, judges, trainers, medical teams, and media.
Madridans, therefore, can meet Manchester City on August 7, without having to stay long in England, which is 2 - 1 - year - old after losing Santiago Bernabeu on February 26.
The winning team will continue to play an 8 - level final in Portugal.
Deeds and rains on the land at the weekend of the merchants
By news reports of overcrowded hotels and tents to judge, at least in the south, it is clear that the Icelandics have been able to travel abroad this summer.
Have those who have left the country been lucky with weather and weather donors, D.V., on the one hand, that the summer was just fine, so far to the very least.
Now, however, it is time for a commercial weekend that has until now been the most tourist weekend of the year.
Yet, it is unclear how it will be this year, compared to other weekends, and today, events that have attracted a large number of people in the ordinary year not to be held.
For example, there is sufficient evidence of a national festival.
The weather will, of course, play a major role, but now it looks like rains all over the country, but especially south and southwest.
From Thursday evening on Saturday evening on Saturday evening, the weather room predicts rain.
It should be noted that long - term predictions are not sacred truth here in the North Atlantic and are likely to change.
In his prediction of the weather site, Bliku, the weather scientist knuckled Einar Svenbjörn’s son that the weekend of merchants is to be expected.
Says he: Attics in the attic with a cold that too often reaches down to the surface, lead to a slight decline in warmer air from the southwest.
Of course, the warmer air above which “flys” the north.
In support of its prophetic map, Einar says: “A little wave from America is coming to the east with summer - bright air.
As she approaches, she draws closer to “bloming” in the form of lower air pressure and thoughtful summer valleys.”
The great prediction, the European Calculator on the left of the map, and the US GFS on the right are somewhat consistent with this development.
For the sick shall go over the prophet late on Thursday, and early on Friday with the sharpness of A, and rain in most of the land.
The medical label of 985 hPa is then followed.
This time some warm air comes in North and Austria on Saturday and even Sunday as well.
On the other hand, it could be blown together.
A man was seriously injured when a car was driven by cattle selected at Wexford

A follower from Law and Orderr all the way to New York
“I was shot at her like a man gets such a young shot, ” says Birna Hron Bjorn’s daughter about Mariska Hargitay, the main actress of the parts Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
She was so stoned by the actress that she came to the scenes and waited for her hours, just to say hi.
When Birna Hrann Björndóttir, the owner of the travel office Pink Iceland, watched, like many Icelandic residents on Law and Orders: Special Victims Unit from the century C.E., she was collapsing for the main actress of the components Mariska Hargitay.
Birna tells the story of her meeting and the actress on the theme Love stories at Rás 1.
When Birna was a teenager herself, at the age that many begin to develop violently, she did not experience it as her peers, for she was in a hurry to suppress her own teachings.
She thought that she was interested in boys’ bands and young magical movie heartnuts, but she was not.
“ I was cutting pop and hanging pictures on the wall of Backstreet boys and Jared Leto.
But there was nothing behind it, it was just me hiding that I was a lesbian."
She says that when people come out of the closet, they go through a late wedding course.
“ We spend our teen years suppressing these teenage impulses, these shots, and so forth.
I think it was one of the things that drew me to her," says Birna about the actress.
“ And there was something about her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm, and I was just shot at it."
When the actress was supported in New York City a few years ago, she ran into a snare.
One of her best friends, Erlingur Ottar Thoroddsen, was shooting a movie there in a city and gave Birna and their friend, Gunnar Helga Gudjonsson, to help with the shooting.
“ We were working at 30 people’s teams, and we spent a great time with strangers.
This is a naturally intimate atmosphere when you spend so long together a day, so it was talked about everything and nothing."
One day, Birna is a great fan of Mariska.
One of the women on the team says that a friend of hers is familiar with the actress because he was on the stage.
Birna could not stop thinking about that fact and regularly ask her new friend how her friends like to work with her actress and whether Birna can get to see her.
“ She tells me to stop this, she doesn’t know if she can make it happen, ” says Birna.
When the movie is taken, the band finally completes a toast, and Birna tries for the last time to convince the woman to try to get the meeting around.
"She'd had a few glasses, and she said she'd only make fun of it."
A few days later, Birna sends her message and asks if something is going on in the matter.
The woman does not respond, and Birna decides to give up.
One morning, she wakes up at long - awaited messages.
“ I look at the phone and scream over me.
Gunnar Helgi wakes up at the ashes, and I say, I have to shower, and I have to do fine, and go down into town."
The woman had then written to Birna that her friend, actors, and arrest Law and Order were supported in a hotel in Times Square.
“ I don’t know when they start or when they stop, but this is the name of the hotel, you’re doing well, ” says the message, and Birna’s dress is tight, asking at the reception where the takeoff takes place and takes the lift up to 45th floor, where the group is gathered together.
Birna will settle and wait until a member of the staff comes to her and asks this uninvited woman if she can help.
“I say I’m looking for Jason and asked the woman to tell him Birna from Iceland had arrived. ”
When the friend finally comes, he looks forward to Birna and asks how, on the other hand, she got all the way to the end of the seat was supposed to be a strict security check.
Birna explains that she has just taken the lift and asks to see Mariska.
“ Yes, I don’t know.
Sit here," says the friend, and Birna's dwindling.
Next door, an extra player sits in the show, and they start talking.
“I say to him, ‘ I am a fan, but you, ’ says Birna.
"I played it like it was the most natural thing in the world."
Time's up, Birna's waiting.
The players regularly appear when a break is made, they talk, and Birna looks around and looks for Mariska, which is nowhere visible.
Finally, the friend comes and tells her he's sadly leaving.
Birna asks him to get into the hands of another employee, but she did not think of going anywhere right away.
Amazingly, the friend accepts it and gets to another employee.
“ He brings his second friend, saying: “This is the woman from Iceland who really wants to meet Mariska. ”
Then he goes.
Finally, after two hours of waiting, the new friend comes running to Birna.
“ He says, ‘ Hurry!
These are unusual circumstances today, there are reporters with her, so she will not stop.
She goes straight to the car with them so you have to take the chance and go down and find her trailer.
It's white and it's marked.
Hurry up."
"So I look right and lose my face" Birna's veins going off and taking the elevator down to Times Square.
There she finds 40 trailers, some marked, and some not.
On the other hand, Marisque’s heart does not find it, and it is desperate to be suffocated.
“ I can feel the bow coming across because I had spent half a day in this, but I thought so well, I tried.
That was fun."
Vondauf, who keeps Birna back to the hotel where she sees through the window the team looks at herself with a knowledgeable end, realizes that Birna did not succeed.
Birna accepts fate, and it begins to rain.
“ I go under a cloud to cover myself up for the rain.
Then I look right and I lose my face."
No one but Mariske Hargitay stood there in her pantyhose suit, which she wears in the show, and Birna knew well — but Birna could hardly move out of his mood.
“ I look at my body and my hands and think now you must move.
Now you must go towards her."
Birna does it and dares to pick up his shoulder on the actress.
“ She looks at me, and I can hardly say anything.
But I'll just say hello, "Birna will come back.
“ I say I’m from Iceland and a great fan.
She says, "It's so nice to meet you."
The conversation didn’t go much further, because Mariska’s car is here and it’s wet.
Mariska turns to Birna and says, “I have to go, but it was really nice to meet you. ”
Birna says "the idol of trust," looks at the car drive away, and then breaks down.
“ I’m going to call you at Erling and Gunna, and they don’t think it worked out.
But I was weeping about tension and joy.
I say, "Yes, I'll meet her." You'll have to see me now.
Then we made a toast to soda and tequila," says Birna.
She does not regret anything, although she admits that she would probably not repeat the game.
“ It’s like once in a lifetime, giving up that time and energy in making things happen.
But I'll always be a fan of this woman."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Birna Ránn Bjarndóttir on the theme Love stories at Rás 1.
Police don't spread the virus
No doubt it is worrying that the crown virus can be delivered by alcohol measurements used by the police.
That's what a policeman in the police traffic department in the capital area says in a conversation with m.m.is.
There have been indications received from people who are concerned that the same mouthpiece is used for all drivers when the police get to grips with it, are on the road, and all those who are going to blow.
The police say, however, that they are careful.
“ It’s not really a special mouthpiece, but we recommend a cup that people blow in, ” says a police officer.
“Some people want to do this, but we’ll guide people to keep a little distance, to a few dozen inches. ”
Asked if it would seem far enough, a policeman said so.
If a positive test is found, the police will be used for a different measure.
It has a mouthpiece, but it comes from a sealed plastic bag and is used only once.
Abdominal distension: Among other things, you can eat anise to reduce pain
The relationship to depression is not a coincidence.
People suffering from enteritis, a disease characterised by abdominal pain, convulsions, bloating, flatulence, constipation and diarrhoea, often experience anxiety and depression, which may lead to worsening of symptoms according to the ADAA.
“ This is because the giant is partly controlled by the nervous system, which responds to stress, ” explained ADAA.
If they do not decrease, food intolerance may occur.
The judge will try to stop the decision that children will be released from the authority of immigration
In his ruling on Saturday, Judge Dolly Gee was invalidating the expected deadline by saying that the United States immigration and customs authorities do not have to release children if they cannot do so by any of the three routes described in its previous decree.
However, Gee also stressed in his decree that the immigration and customs authorities still have a duty to release children without undue delay.
The three paths that Gee proposed to release immigrants and customs authorities, to put children in charge of a responsible person, or to release families under federal jurisdiction.
Shalyn Fluharty, president of the Agency Proyecto Dilley, who provides families with legal services, condemned the decision and told her to put it in the hands of immigration and customs authorities to decide whether to continue to have children.
“The important thing I think is that children are kept out of prison on an untimely basis, and they don’t let out unless the immigration and customs authorities agree to it or the families agree to get themselves broken,” said Fluharty.
Family numbers are held in three locations of immigration and customs authorities in Berks, Pennsylvania, South Texas (Dilley) and Karnes County in Texas.
The children in these places are 1 to 17 years old, according to lawyers and legal representatives.
In June, Gee, who is in charge of the conduct of the Flores Convention on Child Care, said that since “the rules on masking and social exclusion were not followed or were not followed,” it would be urgent to move children from these establishments.
969 people who are in custody of immigration and customs authorities have been identified by the crown virus and are in isolation or surveillance from July 23rd, according to the immigration and customs authorities.
Of these, there are 25 confirmed cases in Karnes, one in Dilley, and two in the custody centers for families.
Overall, more than 3700 cases have been confirmed in custody
Will check the law on the independence of directors
The prime minister does not say unusually that pension funds set goals in his investment policy on the rights of working people.
Commenting on the need to ensure the independence of pension directors, possibly by law, will be taken into account.
After Icelandar interviewed Iceland’s Fly Fries, the board of VR declared that the directors appointed by VR to govern the Life Island Fund’s shopkeepers or to take a vote against the participation of the bioey fund in the expected partial supply of Icelandar.
Ragnar Thor Ingolph’s son, Chairman of VR, continued to say that the directors would be replaced if they did not make the recommendations.
Ragnar Thor withdrew his declaration three days later and also ruled the VR.
On Friday's news, Ásgeir Jonsson, a bank manager, said that the independence of directors of funds in approved funds and possibly with a change of laws would be guaranteed.
Katrine Jacob’s daughter, Prime Minister, says that life - giving directors are independent, but they already believe that this is guaranteed by law.
“ Now, the Central Bank Governor, who, of course, has carried out the financial supervision that has to do with this, has said that it has to look specifically at the rules around this independence, we will, of course, take it into consideration if something has to go over there,” she says.
Katrin says that according to the law, bioey funds set moral standards in their investment policy.
It is desirable to consider the social and moral standards that they want to highlight in their investments.
“ I didn’t think it abnormal, too, that pension funds also set goals in their investment policy on the rights of working people.
But I think it's natural that such decisions are made through policy, not through individual investment decisions," says Katrin.
“Unbearable traffic jams with Álfusárbru,” says the president of the City Council of Aarhus
Helgi S. Haraldsson, president of the City of Jorborg, says traffic jams, which form at the Álfusárbru on Selfoss daily, completely intolerant.
He hopes that new bridges over the Alfus River will be launched in the fall.
As Iceland travels through its land, and on the highways of the country, road traffic is being created every day at the Álfus River Bridge when drivers are on their way to Selfoss or through the community.
Long rows form at the bridge and can take on the patience of drivers to wait in a row.
“ Yes, it’s totally intolerable, it’s one of the traffic jams here and not just on Fridays, because it’s just the word in the days of operation, too.
There are long waitings, sometimes quite up on Hellisheði for those who want to get by on their way east to land and those who are coming to the west, so that it makes sense that we need to get a new bridge and not later than yesterday preferably," says Helgi S. Haraldsson, president of the city board of Árborg.
Helgi says that the city authorities in the city of Árborg recently met with the director of the Road Construction and the designer of the Road Construction, and that meeting was very positive.
“If you’ve ever been optimistic about the work being done on these matters, I think I can say it now, because it’s really been working on this and we should be able to see that a new bridge will be invited out in the fall.”
But is there any advice to the drivers who are in line with the Wallus Bridge every day over the summertime?
“ Yes, it is possible to go through the river and through the river, faster than those who are going east, it is not possible to point them out to go in the Lyngdal Sheath, but those who are going into the countryside should use the Mosfell Heiði, the Congressland, and the Lyngdal Heiði. ”
Helgi S. Haraldsson, president of the city council of Jorborg, who says the traffic jam, which forms at the Álfus year bridge at Selfoss intolerant.
Long waiters form every day at the Álfus perch and often need to wait for a considerable amount of time to cross the bridge.
Then the only way is to take a deep breath and think something positive.
A Future in the Home of the Cool Bears in the North of Brisbane is a court of organization
In addition to the vitality of the region, the city government said that the koalabians, svupíkorns, and the gray gáshauks would be an important link between the natural areas of Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek.
The Commission has appealed to the City Government to the Court of Auditors and the Environment on the grounds that the construction of a civil order law of 2014, would meet the organisational and social needs that have not been met, and ‘goods would be done without unacceptable effects’.
There is a great opposition to these planned activities in the neighbourhood.
The manufacturers argue that despite the fact that the proposal is fully in line with the organization, it could be altered if it does not meet requirements rather than reject them.
As it is, the construction involves many stages, including a service center, a baby care centre, and a 39 - apartment building.
Officials were more than 120 at the time of consultation, and most of them objected to the suggestion that it was too large and inappropriate for the territory.
The leader of the minority in Brisbane’s city government said that the city had to buy the land to protect the koala bears.
“[The mayor] Adrian Schriner has to stop wasting taxpayers’ money in battle with executives in court and buying this country to protect Brisbane’s natural and animal life,” said the city councilman Cassidy.
“ It’s one of the most important homes of the koalabians in the countryside Mountain to Mangroves, and there’s the number of koalabians. ”
Schrinner said this week that the city government wanted the koalabians home in the area to be protected.
“We didn’t find the suggestion suitable for the area,” said Schrenner.
“ I understand that this is now going through the judicial system and obviously we hope that it will result in a good and positive outcome that will keep our home. ”
Schrinner said that a map of the home coalabjara was the joint responsibility of the city government and the government, but that the government is responsible for the precise maps of the koalabjara home that local authorities support when making applications for projects for treatment.
Sunshine: The next step is to win something
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Coach Man Utd, was in the hope of a fighter boat with the team securing third place in the English Supreme Department today.
So the team will be in the Masters Division of Europe in the next period.
United required a uniform or victory against Leicester today and was the result of the 2-0 victory of the Red Devils.
“ A great achievement for the players to reach the third place according to how the situation has been during the season.
I think we may have been able to cross a spiritual holocaust by doing such a great thing, since we have lost two of our eccentrics in this period.
We knew that we needed the finals today, now we can have the next chapter on these boys to win titles," said Solskjär victories.
Manchester United still has the opportunity to win the title during this period, but it is a member of the European Parliament in August and is almost all right in the 8-member finals there.
Wopening begins at midnight in war-respiring East Ukraine
Kiev, Ukraine - the Ukrainian army and opposition in eastern Ukraine are now preparing a “perfect” ceasefire to begin at midnight, which representatives hope to be the first step towards peace after a conflict for 6 years.
On Sunday, representatives of the opposition said that they had ordered their soldiers to take out arms and issued an order to ban the use of weapons.
Ukraine army told its forces “preparation” for the ceasefire.
If it succeeds, it would “provide the way for the execution of other resolutions” the Minsk Peace Agreement, as stated by the President of Ukraine’s office earlier this week, where the ceasefire was called the Time-to-date Treaty.
The objective of the Minsk Peace Union, which was achieved in 2015 by France and Germany, was to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and the separatists who enjoy Russia’s support, which began in 2014 after the Russian accession to the Crimean region and the support of the country for separatism.
More than 14,000 people have died in the conflict.
The presidents of Russia and Ukraine welcomed both the ceasefire on Sunday and stressed the importance of implementing the agreement reached at the Paris meeting in December.
Mr Putin, the President of Russia, expressed concern about the call made by Mr Kiev for the Minks Association to be revised and said that the position of President Volodimir Senenji, the President of Ukraine, on the “indiversity of the Minsk Association, which he again expressed in this telephone call, should be reflected in real action.”
On the other hand, the Czech Republic stressed the need to take action to free the Ukrainian prisoners of rebels in East Ukraine, in the member Crimea and Russia, as stated by the President's office.
According to the agreement of 2015 Ukraine can only have jurisdiction over borders with Russia in the areas that separatists have in their power when they have received extensive self-government and when elections have been held in the territories.
The organization reduced conflicts, but Ukraine and the rebels have continued to fight.
When the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris in December to engage in other talks, support was given to the Minsk Association and agreed to relaunch the peace process.
In 2019, Senenji, who won the elections with the promises to put an end to the conflict, wanted Ukraine to have control of the borders before the first regional councils, whereas the Kremlin government demands that the agreement be implemented without any change.
The new Armaments Agreement was reached on Wednesday by the three-sided group appointed as representatives of Russia and Ukraine, as well as the European Security and Cooperation Agency, and was therefore welcomed by EU officials.
During the traditional Sunday greeting at St. Peter’s Square, Pope Fran also mentioned the ceasefire and said that it had to “rebuild trust and lay the foundation for such a necessary and long - awaited peace with the people. ”
Police: Man shot to death in protests in Texas
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) – A man was shot to death in protests in Texas when he approached a car and the driver in the car ran off his weapon, according to police.
Katrina Ratliff, police spokesperson, told reporters early Sunday that the shooting took place just before 22:00 a.m. at a protest in Austin.
The man was taken to a hospital where he was later declared dead.
The car had whistled, bended down the road and then speeded the journey towards the Protestants, said the witness Michael Capochiano to the newspaper Austin American-Statesman.
According to Capochiano, the man with a rifle got caught and was shot by the driver.
The driver then drove away, said Capochiano.
Ratlif told the press that the first reports would indicate that “the victim may have had rifles” and added that the suspect was in custody and was willing to cooperate with the police.
According to news agencies, the group had gathered because of the Black Live Matter protests on Saturday.
The protests were streaming live on Facebook, where they were heard in the car’s whistle and several gunshots fired.
Markasupa, first victory Blikka, July
A bridge won its first division victory from June 29th, when the team struck IA, 5–3, in Pepsi's Max division of men at the Copavogsfield tonight.
On the other hand, the chess industry loses its third game in a row in the department.
After winning his first three games in the league, Abilblik played five games without celebrating a win and had passed three consecutively before the IA tonight.
It was, therefore, enough or dead for Blikk, who came into the game with great power.
Alexander Helgi, the son of Kristen Steindor, was led by the team with a fair delivery at 11 minutes after the Christian son of Steindor had sent him through the protection of the IA.
Six minutes later, the Christian doubled the lead after a very good preparation for the Gisla Eyjolf son of the left.
In the first half of the campaign, the tax collectors did not get out of sight, since the locals’ high - press made them very difficult to link transmissions together.
The bells had all the power on the field and cut the third goal at a minute of 36, when Danin Thomas Mikkelsen cut the corner of the Hull of the son of Gunnlaut.
At that time, Christian Steindor’s son scored his second goal and the fourth goal of Blikkika only three minutes later.
The first half - story, however, did not end there.
Skags got a bad luck for the latter when Ftigvi Hrafn Haraldsson cut out a little bit of time before the playoff, but Kwame Quee had then broken clumsyly at Viktor Jonssoni within the Cheigs Brika.
4–1 was therefore the place for a Belbeck when the half-game was faulted.
Only three minutes later, the Skagians returned.
Sævar the son of Jon was then alone and unmanaged on the Blika market, and easily guided the ball into the net of the corner of Förvva Hrafn the son of Harald.
On the other hand, Hlynns were broken within IA only three minutes later when he broke Alexander Helga.
Vitspyrna was judged, and Thomas Mikkelsen had a safety test to get Bilbli 5–2 over when only seven minutes were passed by the second half.
Five minutes after the end of the Grand Plenipotentiary, the Skagers cut back.
Anton Ari Einarsson, a goalkeeper, hit them under pressure from Viktor Jonssoni, gave the ball in Viktor’s foot from where the ball was rejected in the net.
Unbelievably 5–3 positions were seen when less than ten minutes were passed by the second half, which slowed down the target score following.
Despite the fine possibilities of both teams to add borders, including two dead spots of Kwame Quee from the Bread Bible, they became no more and the 5-3 victory of the Bread Bible.
There, from 29 June, a waiter won his first victory, and after his victory with 14 points in the third place, two points from Val, a seat above and three from KR's top.
However, KR and Valur have both a game inside Blikk.
The IA has to accept the third loss in a row in the department, but the team has ten degrees in the eighth place, five points from the sink.
The Puppets are not in danger despite the White House's comments
Last night, producers of the Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy Puppy
The statement follows Kayleigh McEnany, a media representative of the White House, that the elements dealing with, among other things, law enforcement dogs were victims of “the culture of exclusion”.
Canadian producers were quick to respond to McEnnany’s comments and reported that their fans had no need to worry about the future of the Puppet.
A number of television shows dealing with police activity have been decommissioned in the United States following a recent protest against police violence.
However, the pup team is not, among other things, despite its reputation on the social media.
At a press conference in the White House on Friday, McEenany said that President Trump of the United States was opposed to a "out-of-life culture" and especially when it came to the police.
The term refers to when speakers or individuals or companies react hard to the social media and are called upon to be protested.
“ We saw it a few weeks ago that shows at the Puppy Puppy Puppy Team, children’s material about cops, were stopped.
Same thing with the show Cops and Live PD," said McEnany on Friday.
Then she added that the Danish toy producer Lego removed a law enforcement kit, but there is no ground for the claim, according to the defenseers of Lego.
However, the reality factors of Cops and Live PD have recently been taken out of the Western Sea exhibition.
Both factors include an exchange of views on the display of actual police work without the permission of individuals who appear there.
Together for 29 Years — Sometimes there is jealousy and suspicion
Kristin Thomas’s daughter, a family therapist, answers questions about family matters, children, and love in the family corner of DV.
On this occasion, she answers those who have never been single.
We've been together since we were 15, we've been together for 29 years, and we have two children.
We know nothing but being together and feeling good, but both of us feel like we're missing out on something.
We have never been with other people and have no comparison of how this could be different.
This has sometimes led to jealousy and distrust as to whether the other person is looking around, thinking about adultery, even divorce, and changing.
When we talk about this, we agree to cultivate our relationship, but this is a nightmare that always hangs over us.
Do you have any advice?
Thank you for a great question and I am glad you have such open communication that you can discuss your complex feelings in connection with the relationship.
What would scare me would be if you were thinking about it in each corner, could not talk about it, and even take some steps that you could later regret.
Everything up on the table, isn't it?
Strongness of self - control has the most predictive of happiness in the future and of the stronger self - image you have, the more likely you will have a marriage mate with a strong self - image.
The reason why relationships that begin in teenage years do not last all their lives is often because people develop in one direction, but in those cases where the effects are additive, individuals can become stronger than many others.
Since your relationship starts to develop during your most molding years, it can be concluded that you have developed together and have a positive impact on each other’s identity.
We are opposed to the relationships we are in.
The way I talk, the way you listen.
The way I show myself depends on how you see me.
A relationship molds who we are.
Could you turn the example around and think, ‘ What do we have that others do not have? ’
What does this many years of experience give us?
I'm willing to say that the cost can be a lot more than the flaws.
You've been molding each other for years, and for years, you can say that you're specially designed for each other.
There are more than many who can say.
That's worth it?
You are talking about the fact that you have missed something, but it is important to remind yourself that major changes, such as divorce and new connections, are also accompanied by accompanying fish for which you are not necessarily excited.
You may be missing out on learning to be alone again, to get to know a new person, and to put together families.
This is accompanied by new challenges, different problems, and possibly something new and exciting.
But this isn't just a pink cloud and happiness, annoyed, at your age, it can be a messy task, which can possibly never crumble as well as you've already done to each other.
Is that worth it?
Furthermore, why not put your focus on what you can do to increase tension, inescapability, and innovation in your relationship?
You haven't put your shoes on the shelf.
There are so many things you can do to make this long relationship even deeper.
What attempts can you make in this regard?
What do you need from your mate that you are not getting?
What can you give to your mate who you have never done before?
You may need to sit down and rejuvenate your relationship.
Would you like to spend more time alone or together?
Would you like to try something new?
Today, there is much more tolerance to various forms of communication, and couples are beginning to define their relationships in various ways, for example, open relationships, multisessions, or temporary withdrawals.
I'm not at all telling you what to do, but no expert in your solutions, but possibly it would relieve this heavy fat that's lying over you, if you look into this and think about it in solutions.
So, what do you need the distrust and fear to go away?
You've been together for 29 years, it must mean you can handle things together.
Use it as a strength and hold your hands toward your solution.
We invite readers to send their questions and misrepresentations to Kristin via e-mail at: horonabundssala@gmail.com.
The questions will then be answered here in the family corner, of course without name, and in full fidelity.

It's a war!
Coleen Rooney hires Johnny Depp's lawyer at the Wagatha Christie barge at Rebekah Vardy.
Coleen Rooney has asked David Sherborne to defend himself against the charges against Rebekah Vardy.
After interviews between football mates took place, their acquaintances are expecting dramatism.
Coleen Rooney has hired his astrologer Johnny Depp to defend himself in his so-called "Wagatha Christie" team with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday quotes that Rooney entrusted David Sherborne to defend herself against the accusations that she had been harmed against Vardy, stating that personal information was leaked to the media by her closed Instagram access.
The news comes a few days after the data were submitted to the Supreme Court, where Rebekah Vardy, who is married to the parishor Jamie Vardy in Leicester City, suffered physically and spiritually after Coleen Rooney’s claim.
According to the magazine, the 38 - year - old mother of five children “has suffered severe panic attacks and panic attacks, so that she was afraid to leave the house, ” and that Vardy, who was then seven months pregnant, “has three times been admitted to the hospital... because of a panic attack caused by the entry and its consequences. ”
In addition to being Depp's lawyer in his case against The Sun, due to the claim that the actor beat his wife, Sherborne goes on 50 years, with the case of the duke and duke of Sussex in their private case against Associated Newspapers, publishers The Mail on Sunday.
After the two football wives failed to agree, those familiar with dramatism in the courtroom were expected.
“If you found the Depp trial playing, don’t underestimate the expected battle of football adventures,” said one source.
“Now this is the real war, and Coleen gives nothing, and not Becky, but this will be emotional. ”
Coleen Rooney claimed that someone who used the Instagram access to Rebekah Vardy had leaked excited stories about her into a newspaper.
She was named "Wagatha Christie" after having made it clear how she spent five months gradually limiting the number of friends who could see updates of Instagram stories in her, until only the account Vardy was left.

Biden’s cosing team refuses “Fox News Sunday” to interview one week after interview with Chris Wallace at Trump
In the interview with Mr. Trump at Chris Wallace last week, the President of the United States questioned that the expected Presidential Proclaimer, Joe Biden, would be able to cope with the deluge that Wallace had on Trump.
We may never get an answer to that question — at least not for now.
On Sunday, Wallace told the audience that Biden’s election team had told Fox News that he was “not available ” for interview.
“ During our interview with the President of Trump last week, he doubted that his opponent in the Democratic Group, Joe Biden, would be in a similar situation, ” said Wallace.
“In the week at both Biden’s election session, they said that the former Vice President was not available. ”
“ We keep asking each week, ” he added.
Trump’s cosing team has been criticising Biden for months in order to avoid a election meeting and a news meeting during his interview while the coronary epidemic is taking off.
Although Biden has recently resumed his campaign, Trump and his associates have continued to mock the vice president earlier for “hiding themselves in their home in Delaware.
However, the slow down of Biden to attend a public event has not damaged his offer, as the latest findings show that Biden has a good lead on Trump in both national and major fighting countries.
The averages of Real Clear Police indicate that the President was 7 percent lower in Florida, 6.7 percent in Pennsylvania, 8.2 in Michigan, and 6.4 in Wisconsin.
Trump worked in all four states in 2016 as he turned them over to the Republican party when he fought the White House.
In the latest Fox News Poll survey, Biden has an advance in Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, out of checkpoint in all cases.
Investigations also indicate that Biden has a little advance in Ohio, North Carolina and Arizona, three other important fighting countries in these elections.
And research suggests that a state that previously trusted the Republicans, such as Texas and Georgia, is now divided between Trumps and the vice president of the former Vice President.
Presidential election, where presidents present themselves for a second election period in the White House, is often a vote on that president — and this seems to be the case today in 2020 in the struggle between Trumps and Bidens.
The most important issues have been the crown virus and economics that are at risk from the epidemic — and the performance and history of the President in both categories of cases.
Kanye West and his wrestlers in the mood.
Today, MUSlCIAN Kanye West apologized to his wife, Kim Kardashian, for the comments he had made in a love crisis.
The head of Psychologists believes that he picks up his creativity, but a psychiatrist says that it is important for people to take medicines to keep the disease under control.
The rapper Kanye West is not only one of the first and most influential musicians of his day, but he is no less famous as the husband of the reality star Kim Kardashian.
To a large extent, his private life has taken place in an open place.
When he announced earlier this month, he offered himself to the president of the United States, holding an emotional and distasteful talk.
Later, on Twitter, a few peculiar ones appeared, claiming that their wife was trying to have him hospitalized.
Kim Kardashian later published an Instagram statement asking people to understand their husband and family; he had bipolar disorder, and it would be difficult for his loved ones to help him if he did not want to seek help himself.
He has then publicly apologized to her.
This famous family is not alone in dealing with this problem.
It is estimated that about one percent of people receive psychosis.
Ferdinand Jonsson, a head doctor, is in a hospital in London, and he knows the disease well.
“ This disease can cause such an enormous burden for individuals and especially for their families and loved ones.
This attitude or mania can destroy relationships and work and cause a great deal of grief.
And then the other side, the depression, it's often very dangerous, because there's a high incidence of suicide in that group.
So I thought it was nice for her to say that.
And it's just human and human," says Ferdinand.
A fan of Kanye West, who is a fan of Kanye West, the head of Psychology, has itself been struggling with psychotypes: “He seems to have a very lively imagination.
If we are four cords of the earth, then he is an hundred cords of the heavens.
And he is such an extraordinarily creative, extraordinarily powerful, and cleverly in his powerful connection thought, because one must be aware of this connection thought that we who have been given to try to get into a state of manhood know so well."
Kanye West doesn't want to take a psychotic, because he thinks they're reducing his creative ability.
He's been talking about the psychopaths, including the Ye album.
The house says it's his choice not to take a medicine.
“The people feel that this creative element is a source of this unrelenting connection thought and extravagant creative power of the fire that he has, but so are the natural flaws of the often great suffering, and the centuries and dark basements and darkness.”
However, Ferdinand says that it is important for Bipolar Disorders to be treated.
“ If you have a lot of mania, you’re not making wonderful things, you’re just on your side.
And just as when people go into severe depression, people are completely crippled by that condition," he says.
So you would advise Kanye West to take medicines?
“ Absolutely, ” says Ferdinand.
“And especially working with someone to find the right doses and this way to balance the balance between the drugs helping him as much as possible, and destroying the things that are beyond his or her ability and his creative power.”

Delhi Metro drops the first pillar to the fourth level of construction
Delhi Metro reached an important stage in the fourth stage of the project when the first pillar was cast for the route between Janakpuri West and R K Ashram Marg, which is being proposed, according to employees on Sunday.
The chair was cast into the Workshop and on a hilly part between the Workshop and Mucarba Chowk on Saturday night.
“Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) took another important step on the fourth stage of the project, the first pillar at this stage of the expansion of the train system was staggered for the route between Janakpuri West and R K Ashram Marg,” said the Declaration of DMRC.

June 24th, DMRC began to pour out an U-bit that would later be placed in the raised section of the route.
At the fourth stage of the construction, 61,679 km of new train tracks will be provided for three different paths with 45 train stations.
These new parts will offer connections between the parts of the train system that Delhi Metro is already operating.
Of these, 22.35 miles [22.35 km] below and other parts will be raised.

"Vehiculist" ambassador wants a gun, a armored car, and a stabbing vest - said the sub-committees were a reminder of the "deep state"
Politically appointed ambassador of the United States on this land, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, who is said to want to carry a gun on in CBS news today.
“ Despite being located in one of the world’s most secure states, ” says CBS, “ Jeffrey Ross Gunter is “sustaining” about his safety since he arrived in Reykjavik last year. ”
Refers CBS to 12 diplomates, executives and former representatives, as well as to individuals familiar with the case.
Gunter’s conclusion was to demand from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs that they request permission from the ambassador paramedics to go through armed in this country.
He should also have wished for a armored car that carried him between places in Iceland and the stabbing vest.
The U.S. Department of State refused to tell us whether any threat would result in the ambassador’s security, but U.S. government representatives said that the ambassador was told that Iceland was a safe country and that he was safe here.
However, according to CBS, lifeguards had been advertised in Icelandic magazines and if they were involved in meeting the ambassador’s requirements.
The CBS report says that the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not want to comment on the matter with CBS.
However, the U.S. news agency, according to its sources in this country, has said that no request has been made to the governments of the country.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter was spoken of as being armed, since it would insult the state of residence, Iceland.
The ambassador was paid to support the election fund of Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential elections.
He used to be a skin doctor in California.
Since Gunter took over in Mai, he said that he has made an “indispensable” work area in the embassy and has already had seven subcommittees, known as Deputy Chief of Mission, under the ambassador’s agent, who is also appointed Diplomates.
They were all experienced diplomas from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
The first one was sent away by the ambassador “because he did not look like him. ”
Had already been preparing for a year and learned Icelandic.
The next one lasted only six months.
After that, personnel had been rooted, and the idea was to let Gunter try as much as possible until he looked at one of them.
Furthermore, CBS says that Gunter was expecting the mission staff to attend the work of the “deep state” and to have buried him against the Foreign Ministry in Washington D.C.
The authorities of the D.C. State Department are well aware of the situation in their missions in Reykjavik, but they have been reluctant to intervene in the management of the embassy in light of Gunter’s contact with the White House.
It is also said that Gunter had difficulties following the orders of the Foreign Ministry in Washington, and when he is said to have refused to return to D.C. while the Covid-19 circuit was on fire.
He left the embassy in the hands of his staff for months.
When he is said to have worked from his home in California, except ordered by the Minister of Foreign Affairs himself, Mike Pompeo, to return.
Luck Turn Back
He finally got the order, turned Gunter back to Iceland in May.
His new captain, Michelle Yerkin, came to the country this month.
CBS has not received a response to their requests to the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
The State Department did not want to communicate with CBS, nor with DV.
Gunter is one of the many political ambassadors appointed by the Trump government who has been paying attention to unusual conduct in the past month.
To form, Woody Johnson raised a hard reaction when the day came when he was trying to have the British open-up championship in a golf course in Trump's possession.
The ambassador of South Africa has also been under instructions for having fired his number two and then trying to appoint her son for the job.
42% of the U.S. ambassadors are politically appointed.
30% were politically appointed to the Obama government, and 32% to the George W. Bush government.

Poland will report on the European agreement on preventing violence against women
Poland’s rightwing government says that the country will withdraw from the European agreement to prevent violence against women.
The Istanbul Convention is the world’s first binding legal act, the aim of which is to prevent violence against women, but the Minister of Justice of Poland, Zbigniew Ziobro, describes the text as “harmful” as it requires schools to teach children from social points of view.
Ziobro said on the weekend that on Monday he would begin to prepare a formal process for the country to declare himself to the contract.
“This ideology is related to attempts to change education in schools and leisure, to the study, attitude and persuasion of a young Polish generation, based on the assumption that our opinion is wrong, that biological sex is old-fashioned and that everything is really about social culture.”
Ziobro believes that the treaty on education of children and young people as well as family ties in the context of LGBT people is unacceptable.
“We also reject the LGBT element in the discussion on family relationships, as this is an opinion held by left-wing activists or homosexual groups who want their views to become binding laws,” he said.
On Sunday, the European Council said that it would be “fearing” to Poland’s association.
On Friday about 2,000 people, including groups of women and other groups of rights fighters, were protested in the Watch Towers outside the offices of the right - hand parties Ordo Luris, who supported the country’s declaration of the agreement.
“We won’t be victims,” they called.
Objections were also made in other cities in Poland.
Poland signed the Istanbul Convention to prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence in December 2012 and completed it in 2015.
Maurice Petty, a machine in the House of Honor dead 81 years old
KANSAS CITY, Kansas (AP) - Maurice Petty, who was part of a quarter-mile race force that includes his father Lee and his brother Richard, and who was the first installer to be taken to Nascar's court, died on Saturday.
He was 81 years old.
Petty's family didn't give up his cause of death.
His funeral has not been reported.
While other members of his family were rowed for their talent behind the wheel, Maurice Petty took in the nickname “Chief” for his talent with the screw cap.
He helped his family to win 198 racers and seven titles in the NASCAR, and also built machines that secured Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal, and Pete Hamilton.
“ The manager was one of the most advanced engine operators in the history of NASCAR, ” said the chairman and manager Jim France.
“ He came with the power that helped Petty Enterprises to gain his advantage in the sports field.
Even though Maurice was known for his work under the hood, he also did various roles behind the tents and did what needed to get his car on the track."
Maurice Petty was born on 27 March 1939 in Level Cross, North Carolina.
He followed his father on the race track when he was small, and his knowledge of machine activation soon became a major factor in the landing of Lee Petty’s victory in 54 races and three master titles.
He competed 26 times in the NASCAR cup in 1960-64, was seven times in the top five seats and 16 times in the top 10.
However, he soon decided to focus on what happens under the hood rather than behind the wheel, which proved to be a success for his older brother, who relied on his machine on his journey.
Richard, who was then called the King, won the first championship along with the Star in 1964 with the Plymouth vehicle.
They won again in 1967, then two consecutive years in 1970 and 1971, and reached three more titles before the end of the 1970 ’ s.
With these seven titles on their backs, they evaluated the largest number of titles with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson.
“ Maurice Petty was one of the true pioneers of NASCAR and was involved in his career at Petty Enterprises in building up one of the top teams in NASCAR,” declared Winston Kelley.
“ Although Petty’s victories are recorded as 212, it calls for a well over 250 victories, if taken with all the machines he built for his rivals.
The boss will be remembered forever as one of the best engines in NASCAR history."
Lee Petty died in 2000, and Patricia, Maurice Petty’s wife to 52 years of age, died in 2014.
He was also the uncle of the former driver and the mediaman Kyle Petty and Trent Owens, head of the patrol.
“ Even though we now say goodbye to Maurice Petty, one of the true and zealous pioneers and heroes of NASCAR, his inheritance and name will be kept in our memories, held in the air, and preserved for all the future, ” said Kelley.
"We sent our deepest sympathys to the Petty family."

The 32 - year - old agreed to extend his contract on a temporary basis to complete the playing time with his partner, but he will be free to sell to AS Roma at the end.
The Spanish nationalist, who came from Barcelona in 2015, has been in a secondary role at Lampard during this season, because he has only been on the starting team in the selection department and played a total of 21 games in all races.
The head of the West London Blue Box confirmed Pedro's departure after the team secured space in the top four seats with a 2-0 win against the Wolves, where the race came into the class to play its last game.
“Pedro has played his last game with the partner,” Lampard said to Sky Sports.
“ The boys clapped him in the dressing room, and it is deserved when he is viewed as a whole and with his partner.
This was his last premier game, but he has set his mark firmly on the team.

After the game in his Twitter account, Pedro published a greeting message, writing: “My last game at Stamford Bridge.
I want to thank every fan for the support over the years, the partner for giving me the opportunity to be wearing blue, and my teammates.
You will always take place in my heart.

He said that the United States has recently given Kosovo a number of armored cars.
During a tour of the Serb tank division, Vucic said that his people were unable to compete with “the donations of NATO” to their neighbors and that “this is why we are up to ourselves”.
Vucic did not specify the type of Serbian military planes that were held to buy, but the media sided governments say his government has made a public request for the delivery of 20 U.S. attack aircraft.
It appears that there was no response from Washington to the request from Belgrade and that it is likely that the price of an attacker aircraft of the type Sukhoi-25 from Russia will be rejected.
Serbia, which pursues a policy of political neutrality in military matters, has recently been given high - developed air protection systems from Russia, which have also provided battle jets, attack helicopters, and armored vehicles.
China, which is also Serbia’s allied nation, has provided the state with the means to use it in warfare.
U.S. officials have discussed openly the imposition of sanctions against Serbia if more weapons are being transferred to the country from Moscow, especially weapons that could jeopardise the security of neighbouring NATO countries.
In the West and neighboring Serbia, people are worrying about Russia’s armaments and the Chinese in Serbia.
The tension is now increasing in the Balkans, but civil war in the 1980 ’ s was subject to civil war.
The Atlantic League had a trade of Serbia to stop the bloody operations of Serba against the split-in Kosovo-Albana in 1999.
Despite the formal efforts to enter the European Union, Serbia’s populist leadership has further strengthened its political and military relationship with the Kremlin and Beijing.
Serbia, as well as Russia and China, does not accept the independence of Kosovo, which the United States and most Western countries have accepted.
Heart attack: The likelihood of this fatal condition may be reduced by eating once weekly chocolate
A new study suggests that some good things may be good for the heart muscle.
And how could this reduce the likelihood of a heart attack?
Scientists have compiled an analysis of coronary artery disease of over 50 decades.
The main symptoms of coronary artery disease (also called ‘cardiac ischaemic disease’) are three: chest pain (angina pectoris), heart attack and heart failure.
Other signs of illness may include palpitations and severe shortness of breath.
“Suculent contains nutrients that are good for the heart, such as flavonoids, methylxanthin, polyphenol and stearic acid, which can reduce inflammation and raise good cholesterol.”
Good cholesterol, also called high-density lipid protein, accumulates “bad” cholesterol — a type of cholesterol that narrows the arteries of the heart — and moves it into the liver.
The “bad” cholesterol (low-density lipid protein) is broken down into the liver and is then removed from the body.
However, the new study does not investigate the dose or type of chocolate consumed.
It is not clear whether the participants ate a dark chocolate, a dairy chocolate, or other cocoa candy.
The results were based on an older study that concluded that cococaine consumption (as found in chocolate) reduced the risk of a heart attack.
Scientists believe that flavonoids found in chocolate lowers blood pressure and improves vascular function.
Vascular function refers to the extent to which the blood distributes oxygen and nutrients through the body and removes waste.
Life styles were not mentioned in the results of the new study.
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein said about the data that those who had admitted to eating chocolate would be more likely to have a healthy body weight.
She added that they could exercise regular exercise and feel less stress.
“Each of these factors could have an independent impact on cardiovascular health,” she added.
Coles replaces plastic toys with books in a new collection presentation campaign
“We have really listened, and there was a key element in preparing a project, ” Ronson said.
“ We don’t believe that people want to recycle the books — we think they will want to keep them, but they can recover them from their homes if they want to. ”
Ronson said the new campaign has been in operation long before COVID-19 came into existence, and despite the journey, she believes that the timing of the new campaign was “a bit of a good thing” because of the amount of time parents now spend with their children.
The researchers have expressed concern about the fact that consumers have become tired of the constant toy collection campaign of the largest major markets, but Ronson says there is no sign of fatigue yet.
“ We haven’t seen anything like this yet, but we keep our eyes open for it all the time, ” she said.
“ We provide a great deal of data, from week to week, month to month, to ensure that what we leave is consistent with our customers.
It was Cloes who routed the collection campaign, such as Little Shop in Australia, but the first in mid-2018 was the drive behind the best four-year sales of the supermarket from the beginning.
Woolworths followed with Lion King Oosheis, who also helped the supermarket to expand its sales, and the last time the environmentally friendly campaign of Discovery Garden customers offers free plants and flowers for planting.
However, the new collection campaign could have less effect this time, as UBS researchers predict increased sales in large countries in Australia in the largest part of the financial year 2021.
Ronson said customers can expect more comprehensive gathering campaigns in the future and that campaigns such as Little Shop are likely to become less common.
“ There is a lot of gathering campaign in many parts of the world that we look at, and we keep getting inspiration from other countries, ” she said.
“We need to do this to make sure that we do more and more with our customers.”
Five rounds around the country this summer
The photographer and material producer Jon Ragnar Jonsson, often known as Jon From Iceland, has been more and less concerned about Iceland since the pandemic.
John completed a study in business studies at the University of Reykjavik a few years ago, but he is now in the process of traveling and producing marketing material for individuals and businesses.
The summer began early with Jon, or April, when he traveled throughout the West and stayed in his car.
The rest of the year, he has gone about five or six circles around the country.
Besides, he's been on countless day trips here and there.
What trip has gone out of?
“ For someone like me who's always on the run and seen everything, it’s hard to name a favorite place.
It is the more weather and the company that matters.
Since June, a lot of highlands have recently been opened.
They always get up because it's so much adventure to get to the destination.
The last trip there is the possible favorite trip of the year, but then we went 25 together on 5 big cars up by River Chain and down to River Lake."
What's up with you this summer?
“ I have a lot of excitement in the next few days, but I was finishing a choking course with DIVE and now taking choking trips here and there in Iceland.
Then I was adding surfboards to my dotakassen so I'll be more into the sea than before.
I'm heading for a 10-day “solo” trip with everything I need my back, but it'll be revealed later in summer where I'm going.
Otherwise, I'll be on highlands in the next few months, as it won't be possible to look at that area all year."
What is your favorite place in Iceland?
“ It’s always hard to choose one place, but the Jack’s Year Moon has been part of my life since I remember.
My family and I went to a summer camp at the roots of Berkmerjökul, and since then I have always felt good in that area.
I think I'm safe to say that I've been there over 100 times."
With what place in Iceland do you recommend that people visit?
“I’m going to bring one pearl from each part of the country, but it’s: a mule in the South, an Austrian Stable, Aldeyjarfoss in the North, a red sand in the West, a snowflake in the West, and last but not last... a merifelle on Highland. ”
What is indispensable in the journey?
“I’m not going to land unless I wear the following in the car: a good flashlight, a hanging room, a lopapeys, a hunting knife, an ice cube, a refrigerator box, and a piece of goods... those who know me about what I’m talking about. ”
Seeking 24 romances afraid of drowning off an island in Malaysia
ON Sunday, KUAL LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — On Sunday, the Malaysian authorities said they were looking for 25 rowing refugees who are afraid of drowning after jumping off a boat away from Langkawi, a tourist island in the north of Malaysia.
Zawawi Abdullah, a senior official of the Malaysian National Dem., said that the first information from the police revealed that only one of the 25 predators who had jumped off the boat had been able to swim into the land.
The man who survived sought help from the police late on Saturday and has been held while the matter is being investigated, according to Zawawi.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslim voices have fled Myanmar because of military operations, and many of them live in overcrowded refugee camps in Bangladess.
Muslims are the majority of the people of Malaysia, who have been a frequent target of boating parties who promise refugees a better life in another country.
Zawawi said that two ships and aircraft were used for the search.
He said that the National Monuments also remember to alert sailors in the area and authorities in neighboring Thailand to help with their search.
He gave no further information about the boat.
Last month, the authorities in Malaysia, in 269 Rohensals, found a dead body in a boat suspected of being used for smuggling off Langkawi’s coast, which they decided to have been damaged on purpose so that he could not go back to sea again.
Malasia’s rampage later said that 269 persons were transferred from a large ship with dozens of persons thought to have died and that their bodies were thrown into the sea.
The prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, said that Malaysia could not accept more rowing refugees, since they are faced with an economic crisis because of the chronic virus epidemic.
He said that, on the other hand, those who are already in the land would not be sent back to sea.
In Malaysia, more than 2 million illegal immigrants, along with some 180,000 refugees and asylum seekers — including 101,000 voices — are registered by the United Nations Organization of Refugees.
The people of Aswan gather, wake up, and return a load of chocolate to Sudan after a car seat
The transporter on his way to Sudan with many tons of chocolate selected on the international road between Aswan and Abu Simple on Sunday, at the street assembly at the village of Wadi Karkar, when the driver fell into death due to a heat stroke.
The people of the city gathered to assist the driver in lying and to save the oily goods.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, described his position so that the driver “was walking along our village; we couldn’t just stand by.
We're supposed to help people in distress, no matter where they come from."
He added that the villagers had come to an ambulance to pick up the driver and then tried to save the truck’s cargo, estimated at three million Egyptian pounds.
Bahr told the villagers that they were in the field from morning to evening, saving as much of their cargo as they could.
“ What we found most important was to save the driver’s life, protect the vehicle and open the international road again, ” he said.
The villagers were willing to give the injured driver water and shelter, said Bahr, and added that they just wanted to ensure that he would come to and from the village safely.
It was already a crime in the Senate, and the Korean virus could make it worse.
“The epidemic alone is a call to our elected representatives for the leadership and vision we expect in times of difficulty, ” says a report prepared by Leonard Steinhorn, professor of communication at American University, and Mark Sobol, author and expert in organizational development and management.
“ But we also face other debts that are related to the inherited sin of our nation and to the racial imbalance that has plagued our country from its establishment. ”
The study reviews familiar issues related to the pitiful state of the parliament: lack of real links between categories, agendas that limit the scope for communication, excessive coordination of government in leadership positions, constant demands for financial resources, inter-class co-operation rates, negative impact of 24-hour media, the fact that the most important elections for Congressmen are often pre-consultation and finally silenced minority groups.
It is also warned that the Congress will move more into the Internet because of the pandemic, where such a system, which allows election by means of a standard vote in a representative department without the need for Congressmen to travel to Washington, could still increase the problems that exist.
If the idea of remote counciling reaches foothold, it would be a serious setback for attempts to increase communication between categories, as stated in the report.
“ The epidemic of the world was forced to transfer most of its activities to the Internet, and we certainly understand why,” says the report.
“ But even though it was necessary, it should not be interpreted as virtue. ”
The document says that the Congress “needs more than less communication between Congressmen, face - to - face. ”
They need to study one another’s districts better, have polite conversations to find a common surface and build up a link based on trust that can lead to increased understanding and solutions."
The call for courtesy was especially in force this week, when Mr. Ted Yoho, president of the Florida Republican Republic, attacked Alexandriu Ocasio-Cortez, Senator of New York with events, and his colleagues in the Republican Party joined forces in attacking Mr. Liz Cheney, Senator of the Republican Republican Republic in Wyoming with hostile words.
The Congresswoman Val Datings talks about the vice president, lets Trump hear it for mercy
The Congress of Val Deminings (Democrats, Florida) was not shy about discussing her interest in the office of Vice President Joe Biden and expressing sincere gratitude for being appointed to the office.
This respected member of the Group of the Party of BlackPressUSA was in the interview with the BlackPressUSA live party because of the #FIYAH! Live factor and told her story, energy, and commitment that has brought her to her place today, and began with the words “You know all my story. I grew up as the daughter of a maid and janitor in Jacksonville, Florida”.
Dating was one of the four prosecutors of the Council of Representatives in the trial of Donald Trump of the Presbyterian Department in January.
Regardless of whether the Presbyterian Department is infected with Trump, it will be recorded in the history that it is the fourth indicted president.
In an interview with the NPR of his office at Capitol Hill, this former prosecutor of the Council of Representatives was noted: “Did this mean it? It has been worth it every day”.
She added that despite the disappointment of the decision, Democrats would have been obliged to follow the case regardless of its outcome.
During the interview, Demining made it clear that she is opposed to Trump’s respect for Roger Stone’s prison sentence, which was condemned for lying before the council (with the exception of other crimes), as well as to his grace for other criminals who were convicted of similar crimes, when she said: “The impassionment to bring your friends, who have lied and cheated to cover your iniquities. ”
Members are at the top of Joe Biden’s list of potential candidates for vice presidents, who also hold the President of Karen Bass (democracy, California), Stacey Abram’s former Senator of Georgia, the Governors of Kamala Harris (democrats, California) and Tammy Duckworth (democrats, Illinois), Keisha Lance Bottoms Mayor of Atlanta, Susan Rice, former ambassador of the United States of America, and some others.
However, she pointed out that only one person would decide who would join Joe Biden in the fall.
"It's Joe Biden."
Then she brought her hand to her mouth while she laughed and thought whispered to those watching the live broadcast, adding “If you want to call... you can do it for me”.
No doubt, regardless of the political viewpoints, history will consider this period as a time of evolution in American politics and attitudes.
It didn't happen to Demining.
She pointed out that the number of women involved in the promotion of vice presidents of the United States is an opportunity to break through the remaining “glorious roof ” — especially for women of African origin.
“ It’s exactly this opportunity that I’m working so hard that I’ve had all my life to create for young boys and girls who’ve heard that their color is wrong, that they don’t have enough money or that they’re of the wrong sex,” she said.
The Congresswoman committed to ensure that the Democratic Group National Committee and the Biden election team would advertise and work with Black Press of America to make as many people as possible to choose.
“I will call Tom Perez (the chairman of the Democratic Party Committee), and I will put this on the top of my list,” promised Dings.
She agreed that this would have to happen now rather than later in the election campaign.
When she answered the words of former U.S. Minister Hillary Clinton that Trump could refuse to leave the White House, he lost the election, and another editorial saying that the President is preparing to receive himself, he lived over Degnings: “As much as he suggest to grant himself, I felt unhappiness.”
“ But who would ever do that other than Trump?
I think he hates this job.
There is no way to get away with breaking the law and ignoring the constitution of this work.
I think he hates the job, but he can't stand losing.
I can absolutely believe that the President will not want to leave the White House, but we have our ways to take care of it, and if that happens, I just want to be with the people who make it happen."
Children’s children’s children’s children’s children’s children’s children’s children’s children’s children’s
There are bottles for children who want to drink with their parents from their young age in bottles that fit the table in better days.
No doubt now there are some parents who rejoice — or those parents who have been led by their childish protruders with decorations.
Yet, the children who reach out to their parents ’ glasses are not the same, for they find it more exciting to see their feet.
This debated glass we go along with on the modern-houseestials.com page, which contains a variety of gold moles.
The bottles have a good bar, a stable foot, and have a good temperature - therefore kids can enjoy the soup, whether hot or cold.
Each bottle contains about 150 ml capacity.
Those who want to take a closer look at the glasses can check out on their website, but the bottles are available today on a small amount of $3,400 in the Icelandic language.
Alibaba and Jack Ma were in court in Gurugram for their former employee
Gurugram, July 26: The company Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma, have been brought to justice in Gurugram after the company’s former employee claimed that he had been expelled from protesting paper studies and false news in the company’s programs.
The case is dealt with in the District Court of Gurugram and private court judge Sonia Sheokand has published a policy for Alibaba, Jack Ma, and over 10 others, asking them to appear in court on July 29, according to news.
The judge has also requested written answers from the company, according to Reuters.
Parmar, who served at the UC Web office in Gurugram until October 2017, claims to a $268,000 U.S. U.S. dollars in damages according to judicial documents.
“We stand by the company’s commitment to the Indian market and the well-being of its employees, and its policies are in accordance with current laws.
We can't tell ourselves about the current procedure," said UC India in a declaration.
“The lawsuit also contains a “list of sensitive words” that contains a password in Hindu and English, such as the “India and China border” and the“ China and India war” that is stated in the complaint that the UC Web uses to write literature on its systems in India,” says Reuters.
Last month, the Ministry of the Interior banned 59 Chinese cell phone programs, including UC News and UC Browser, in line with an increased tension between the two countries.
A New York City fireman's representative says it's "real" okay to exempt a white fireman from the honorary price.
A representative who deals with the multiplicity of New York City firefighters says it's "real" okay to keep a white fireman from honoring to the point where the flag bears can all be black, according to a new story.
White fireman Daniel McWilliams has appealed to the discrimination on the grounds of race after he was removed from a group of captives at a memorial Mass in November 2017 to commemorate the fallen members of the Vulcan community, which is the brotherhood of black firemen.
Furthermore, according to the New York Post, the chief representative of the fire fighting in the field of multiplicity and accessibility, Cecilia Love.
McWilliams is one of the three firefighters in the department who, in a historical image, are seen lifting the American flag at Ground Zero on the days after the 11th of September attacks.
According to McWilliam's dearness, the fire department had chosen him to be the only flag bearer in honor of the Memorial.
To be a flagrant at this ceremony was “a great honor and privilege” for McWilliams, according to CNN.
When he reached the ceremony, however, he was prevented from participating in the honorary host of the former President of the Vulcan Society, Regina Wilson, for the claims she had made that all the flag carriers at the Mass would be black.
She then asked McWilliams – a 29-year-old employee of the New York City firefighter – to help in another way."
Among other things, she claimed that she asked him to do is to escort and set up the uniform firefighters away from the mess.
McWilliams claims in his legal application that he asked Wilson if she was taking him out of the honorary price because he wasn't black.
She confirmed that it was so, he said.
Wilson, who has been working for 21 years in the fire brigade of New York City and who also participated in the rescue work of September 11, will have replaced McWilliam with one of the Vulcan members.
McWilliams claims that he abandoned the Memorial ceremony “to spare himself from further shame, humiliation, and reproach, ” as friends and coworkers heard what went between them, according to the New York Daily News.
When Loving, a black man, testified in court, a lawyer named McWilliam, Keith Sullivan, asked her: “The fact that asking for everyone to be black in honor is not a difference? ”
“ No, it isn’t, ” said Love, according to the New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Love whether it would be okay to ask everyone to be black in the price of honor, which she said, “Absolutely. ”
Lover explained that it would be good to share a white person with a black person in order to “make up our special position and different backgrounds to create pride, coordination and support for one another. ”
McWilliams first submitted a complaint about discrimination based on race in New York City fire fighting in January 2018.
He then appealed against Wilson, the fire brigade of New York City, New York City and unnamed individuals in May 2019.
Sullivan said that after McWilliams presented his complaint, Wilson’s supporters would have avenged him and threatened him.
At one point, one of her supporters will have laid hands on McWilliams and said: “I have heard of you, they told me you would behave like this, and now you know who I am. ”
In a slide, Sullivan wrote that it would have been “happy” to exclude McWilliams from the price of honor at the Mass and a sign that one thing didn’t happen to everyone at the firehouse.
“ If you are a black person, and the difference between a white person at work is at most a reminder, ” said Sullivan.
Wilson, according to the lawsuit, was given “advisation for one hour” for her treatment of McWilliams.
In the meantime, a white person who discriminates against a black person receives “hard punishment, ” wrote Sullivan.
“New York City’s fire has created a policy and process designed to please members of the Vulcan community, who act in a racist way, excuse their actions and assist them... and this needs to be stopped,” wrote Sullivan.
Disgusting walker and demanding money
One was arrested in the middle of the city after a robbery attempt in which he threatened a walking passerby and tried to recover money from that person.
The man was saved in a prison cell.
Then the police were notified of a man with a knife in the city center.
The knife was confiscated and the report was taken from the person.
More than 80 cases came in on the police table in the capital area from 17 to 05, and this morning six were saved in a prison cell.
Among other things, police stopped the driver of a car that pulled a trailer on Kjalarnesi, where the trailer’s trailer was in a very bad condition.
The host was stationary and intended for the owner to provide transport equipment to move it to town.
At that time, police stopped the production of drugs in the Watch Tower Society.
Two were arrested for the case, and they were released after a report.
Also, there was a report on individuals who fired fireworks in the Watch Tower Society.
Had they escaped from the scene when the police arrived, “they probably knew the shame of still a great long time ago. ”
Thousands of people in Khabarovsk still insist on Putin’s resignation
Thousands of citizens were in charge of the Russian city of Khabarovsk yesterday, protesting the arrest of the governor in the congregated province of East Russia and the insertion of his successors, who have never lived in the province.
A former district chief, Sergei Furgal, will be using the popular and tens of thousands of citizens protesting when he was arrested and brought to the custody of Moscow earlier this month, accused of having ordered the murder of three businessmen 15 years ago.
In a recent week, Furgal was formally set aside as governor and his 39 - year - old brother, Mikhail Degtyarev, appointed in place of him, with little interest in the locals.
Is Degtaryev said inexperienced and, worse still, without any connection with Khabarovsk and called the people of the city as soon as possible.
They've called Degtaryev. They've acted like the wind around her ears.
The protesters yesterday were little less than in the first protests, or fifteen to twenty thousand, and the demands were the same as before: the deliverance of Furgal, and the resignation of Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia.
“We want the governor to be released, because we believe that his arrests are highly illegal,” says the AFP News Center after a 50-year-old Protestant, Alina Slepovu.
She claims that Kremlin’s agents had the Furgal arrested “to protect their own interests, but not the interests of the province. ”
In Khabarovsk, however, the Protestants were unfavorable despite a cloudless violation of the current convention ban on the Korona virus epidemic.
In Moscow, however, the police arrested at least ten people who met at the Pushkin Square to show protesters in Khabarovsk’s support in action, says the British Guardian report.
The Furgal class, the Russian Democrat Party, is a group of hard-line nationalists, and political commentators consider it somewhat loyal to the Kremlin regime in most cases.
On the other hand, the same political commentators inform the BBC that Furgal’s victory in the governor’s election two years ago — which was a great and indisputable one — has been a major shock to Putin and the United Russia, and although it indicates that the grip of the Kremlin in the East was becoming ill.
Furgal was arrested on July 9, and transferred to Moscow, where he awaits trial.
He is accused of ordering three murders in the years 2004 and 2005.
Two of them were gone: but the third went out of the midst.
Sarah Rainford, a BBC reporter in Moscow, says that Furgal’s followers, who enjoy their popular home, believe that the prosecution and arrest have political roots.
They want to know why the government waited for him to be arrested until now, says Rainford, 15 years after his supposed break.

Homeless disabled women participate in the fight against COVID-19 in Chennai
Shanthi, a disabled woman who is educated as a tailor, visits 250 homes every day to identify people with symptoms in Kodambakkam, a large covid infection area in Chennai, where there have been some 10,000 cases.
Work day starts early, 7:30, and ends about 4:00.
It measures heat among residents, questions about symptoms, and teaches them about the importance of using masks, washing hands regularly, and keeping away from others.
In fact, her work has led to the detection and treatment of infection in four positive individuals.
Shanthi is one of 16,000 Chennai's employees who are not healthcare professionals.
The project, according to the authorities, has contributed to a 50 - percent reduction in positive cases, in Chennai’s daily count, while increasing in the other provinces of Tamil Nadu.
Shanthi says not all the people are cooperative.
She adds: “Most people are cooperative when a woman with disabilities approaches them.
Some, though, will be irritated.
But this is not to worry about.
I think people should be safe.
When I come back the next day, the people are polite.
It helps to build a good relationship."
And there are more women like Shanthi who stay in the gistylite of the city for women with disability and put the fight against Covid-19 team.
Not far from Kodambakkam, Kavitha, who also has disability, has also taken part in the effort as an overseer.
Although Kavitha has a special wheel, she goes on to meet people and keeps on her bike.
“ I’m happy, ” she says, “I want to see them go down to about 100 a day.
I'm sure we can get it."
At the first floor of the Gistyli, where the two people live, Matilda Funceca, a basketball woman who uses a wheelchair, and Manimekalai, who is a teacher, they send all the data received from approximately 40 women to Chennai City's web service.
Matilda says she's not afraid to be infected by the corona virus.
“ When we help others, God protects us, ” she adds.
When asked what steps she will take, Manimekalai says: “I use a mask, keep a distance, and often wash my hands.
I also drink Kabasura Kudineer, a sidedha drink that enhances the immune system."
A few months ago, when the crown virus first arrived at Chennai, these disabled women warned of their time and abilities in sewing masks for health professionals in the city.
Dr. Aishwarya Rao and the director of the Gistyli, as well as the Dorcas research station, says: “They adapt to the needs of each hour.
In the past, masks were missing, and they were not left behind.
Now it's time for community intervention, and they answered the call."
Choronavirus infection in Tamil Nadu has now become 200,000 after 6989 new cases in the last 24 hours, but it is also the largest number of infections detected in one day, according to official data.
Eighty-nine have died, and 7758 have recovered in the past 24 hours.
The total number of infections in the country is now 206,737.
Police are trying to find out the last steps of a teenager in Helensburgh
Investigators investigating the death of a teenager in Helensburgh are now trying to bring together a timeline of his last trips.
The body of 19 - year - old Kirk Allan was found at a home in Johnson Court about 6:25 p.m. on Saturday.
A 30 - year - old was arrested, and the police confirmed on Sunday that he had now been charged with death.
He'll be in Dumbarton's court on Monday.
Police chief Steve Martin said: “Our mind is with Kirk’s family and friends in these difficult times.
Police will continue to work with the community and support it.
Our research continues to get a full picture of what happened, especially Kirk's last days before his death, but we are not looking for anyone else in connection with death."
South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox report on their experience of discrimination
In the last few weeks, it has become clear that many skeletons are still in the closet in connection with race rights in South Africa.
Building conversations must take place, and action must be taken to welcome everyone in sports.
Ashwell Prince, a former protease star of Proteas, made his former white teammates hear it and accused them of racial prejudice by saying that he and other black people are “murders. ”
Prince said that the black gamers of Proteas have been made public by their white teammates.
He added that it was sad that even though black players such as Makhaya Ntini and now Bräbso Rabada received the highest standards in sport, some people still connected with the quota debate.
Prince, who is now the coach of the Cape Cobras team, made this statement fall to the United Coalition for Sport and Community Based Organisations (UCSCBO)' Web meeting on Thursday night.
The aim of the organization is to continue with the ambitious discussion of the historic race rights in South Africa.
“ Just as I said when I was relieved on social media, it’s not my intention to come and draw people’s names into the area, but this is a real incident...
"You're doing everything right, but you're still getting infected."
Paul Roberts, a former musician and a carpenter who became a programmer at NASA, now works at a software company.
He and his wife, a former nurse at Methodist Hospital who views himself as a optimist, held out an amateur magazine on the Internet and attended a Comic Con event earlier in the year.
Once a week, they pulse with their two daughters, their son-in-law, and a 7-year-old, and play an intense Uno game.
“ They’re amazing nerds, ” says Roman, 38, about his parents.
Sheryl Roberts, 65 years old, is aware of the epidemic’s dangers — diabetes, asthma, and heart disease that can put it at increased risk.
Her husband has a chronic lung disease and a stent that keeps a previously blocked coronary artery open.
“We’ve been so careful, very careful, and keeping away from people,” Sheryl Roberts said.
Her husband began to work away from home this spring, when the journey fought hard in Washington, New York, and other areas around the country.
Paul has repeatedly made “gamallenna time, ” and one of their real dates in the past month was, according to Sheryl, when they began to look at wildflowers through the car window.
Their younger daughter was also careful.
Then she came home from work one day in the middle of June and thought she was allergic.
Soon she experienced cough, fever, headache and diarrhoea, and lost all sense of taste and smell, which are typical of the crown virus.
“ She said: “I don’t know what’s going on, Mother, but I was wearing a mask, wearing gloves, washing my hands,” Sheryl said.
"You're doing everything right, but you're still getting infected."
Elaine Roberts, who was diagnosed with positive coronosis, did not become seriously ill.
The situation, however, was much worse with her parents.
Paul Roberts and his wife began to sneeze and then cough, just as their daughter did, and then received hot and great pain in the body.
Sheryl Roberts then said: “He became very sick, very quickly.
June 22, he was confused.
Worryingly, she checked his oxygen level.
It was low, and she asked their older daughter to take him to an emergency reception, for the second time in two days.
The royal couple of former men felt that it was “nosed” in the Queen’s Christmas talk, according to a new book
MEGHAN Markle and Harry Bretaprins found his grandmother, Britain’s queen, “disgusting” them in his Christmas talk.
The new life story of the couple, “Finding Freedom, ” shows that they were found to overlook them in the collection that was seen in the Christmas talk.
Among the pictures on the desk of the queen, the Vilhálm of the British Prince, Kate Middleton, and their three children, King Karl Bretapris, and Kamilla’s wife, as well as Prince Philip, were shown.
But Meghan and Harry were nowhere to see even though Archie was born in May, yet the boy was mentioned as her Majesty’s “loving granddaughter. ”
The new August book also states that Meghan and Kate Middleton were “never friends,” since they“ struggled to get over superficial politeness ” and met just a few times.
Yesterday, it was claimed that his brother, Harry and Vilhálm, began some years before his relationship with Meghan began, but it reached its peak because of the marriage of Vilhálm and Kate Middleton.
The Duke of Sussex felt that he was “warning ” at events with his brother and Kate Middleton, and it is claimed that“ he wanted to change things long before Meghan came into existence. ”
The members of the Watch Tower Society blame the labor leaders for wanting to keep public workers “in the world forever. ”
Officials of the Party accuse workers of wanting public workers to be “home forever,” after the leaders protested Mr. Boris Johnson that people returned to work.
Sergeants were accused of wanting to work “at home forever” after protesting Boris Johnson to the people to return to work.
The members of the Watch Tower Society were angry when the civil society of public and public staff told their social partners to question when their officials ordered them to return to their workplaces.
Andrew Percy, former minister, said it “unacceptable” that the necessary public service as a release of passports would be stopped while public market staff had worked hard to keep the community walking in the coronary epidemic.
“ It’s unacceptable that people refuse to return to their jobs while the workers in warehouses and factories around the country have continued to work so that official staff could eat while this has taken place,” he said.
“ Many of these employees now want to leave for summer, but they can’t because of the people who refuse to go back to work, even if they are safe.
Sergeants cannot maintain this course of stay at home forever — especially now when we know that people can safely return to work."
Following a call by the Prime Minister last week, Alex Chisholm, a newly appointed head of the public service, announced that he had to “return from public service workers from home and speed up their return to work until August 1st”.
The civil society of public and general staff told their social partners, who believe that they would not have to meet this requirement, and this is a matter of politics.
The spokesperson of the civil society of civil servants, the largest civil society in Britain, said that the demand to return to the workplace was “not provided with the health and safety of our social partners in advance, or to strengthen the economy.
This is only due to political pressure from the Congressmen of the Watch Tower Society, who demand that public service be used as an example to get others back to work.
Our advice to the social partners is clear: If you do your job at home, and someone in your department asks you to come back to the workplace, don't take what of course you have to do."
The issue is due to an increasing dissatisfaction with a delayed version of passports because employees work at home, but some 400,000 people are now told to wait for their applications to be processed.
The Ministry of the Interior has now published that it will ‘ seek to speed up ’ applications from the British for travel in the next two weeks, and from those who have been waiting for a passport issue for more than four weeks.
Public and public staff working groups have acknowledged that some have had to wait up to 143 days for passports, but they argue that “small and often narrow offices” make it difficult for 4,000 road service staff to keep the necessary distance.
The former Governor of the government, David Davis, urged the leaders of the labor unions to “make wise ” and seek cooperation with governments to bring people back into their workplaces.
He added that if he were in the government, he would ask a labor officer: “What is it that you want? That people stay at home for the whole summer? ”
However, various of Britain’s largest companies have also ignored Johnson’s recommendation to return to work.
A study of larger workplaces with a total of some 400,000 employees revealed that only about 40,000 of them have returned to their workplaces.
The emphasis on history can play an important role in reconciliation
God’s love has widened, but understanding and contentment should be the goal.
The school system is partly responsible for this lack of knowledge and understanding.
Too little is taught by an alcoholic history.
The fact is that without radical action, the only teaching article that specifically deals with our history — “Saga Australia” for the 12th grade — will die out within the next five years or even earlier.
Last year, only 628 students in Victoria completed a study in Australia of a total of 49,324 in primary school, or just 1%.
Over the past six years, this number has almost decreased by half, but nearly 100 fewer students register for the subject each year.
The primary reason why so few students choose to learn about Australia’s 12th - grade history is that little has been done in previous years of study to arouse their interest.
History is not even a unique field of study, but it falls under the wider “discipline. ”
Therefore, students in Grades 7 and 8 complete only one short unity on “the early settlers and islanders in the Torres Strait and their culture”.
During the 9th and 10th years, there is another unity in Australia during World Wars.
For many students in Victoria, this is all that is taught about Australia during its primary school years.
During the 9th and 10th years, there is another optional unit over the period 1750-1918.
It is urgent that three actions are taken to save East Africa’s history in Victoria’s schools.
First, history must become an independent subject, such as English, mathematics, and science.
Since history is only taught as part of the study, it has little room for study.
It is usually taught by people who have a general education in mind science but who have not learned history.
Histological skills, such as analysis of information, are complex.
We must employ more specialised historians to ensure that such skills are presented in an accessible and exciting way.
Third, Australia’s history from 1788 to 1914 must become a matter of duty.
Students appreciate what they know.
So many of my former students chose not to learn Australia’s history in the 12th year of study, so they would have had to learn the material from scratch.
Knowledge of history alone does not see bridges deep between races.
But without it, as can be clearly seen in Victoria’s study, the project is hopeless.
Dr. Matthew Bach is the congressman of the State of Victoria's Congress and former assistant principal Ivanhoe Girls' Grammar.
Aaron Elís in Europe - Iceland, split up in half
Aaron Elís Tränderson has come to a final play on the European scene in the Danish selection section of football.
Isaac Bergmann Johannesson played only the first half with Norrköping’s head against the Gulf of Falkenberg, Sweden.
Aaron Elís was in the presence of OB, Denmark, when the team continued to play a decisive role in the European Union’s rivalry.
The OB will meet with AGF or FC Copenhagen in the final game, but it will depend on whether the team will end up on the final tour of the top part of the Danish selection department later today.
Aaron Elís played the entire game for 1 – 1 counties to Horsens on the field today, but OB had won the first team on the home field, 3–1, and thus won a total of 4–2.
Isaac was at the beginning of Norrköping, which was unexpected 2–0 below the first half-time against Falkenberg's bottom in the Swedish selection department.
Norrköping made a threefold split at the beginning of the second half, and Isaac was one of those who had to depart.
Norrköping reached an estimate, but Falkenberg reached 3 to 2 in 89 minutes.
Still there was time for Norrköping to recover from hell at the last moment, 3–3.
Norrköping continues at the top, with 24 points, four points ahead of Elfsborg and five points ahead of Malmö, which will be played for good later today.
Falkenberg did enough to get off the bottom for a while, but the team is up above Helsingborg and Kalmar, who have a game for good.
Collecting sources of the National Festival of Crone Virus Times
Anna Lilja, daughter of the winners, founded the Facebook group “My National Festival 2020” to gather the sources of the national festival that the Eyes intend to celebrate next weekend.
Many are going to dwell in their ways and rejoice with friends and relatives.
Anna Lilja spoke to Hanta in the hall of the Bell.
“ There’s nothing coming in yet that’s very exciting also because there’s 600 people in the group, so people are clearly going to do something, ” says Anna Lilja.
Something about the Eyes having tent parties at home in the garden.
“ Men have spoken of being with their own [the festival], perhaps tents in the garden, and who are loyal to their family, as they always do at that time, ” says Anna.
“ A man assumes that he will spend his time with his people.
However, it is likely that many people will not simply be there “but to hold a small festival somewhere else. ”
The National Festival Committee is now working hard to repay the tickets purchased, but Anna believes that many homeers are more likely to secure tickets for next year’s festival.
"You're even investing now in the tickets and getting valid for 2021."
“ I’m a great national festival, love preparation, and all about this, but sometimes something comes into life that you don’t control, and then it’s just like that, ” says Anna, “but according to the fact that people ask if the Eyes can’t let go of the National Festival once. ”
Anna Lilja says that he has not formed the group for himself or to encourage people to keep their own national festivals but to gather sources of Versailles in the Islands this year.
“ What did people do in these strange times?
I'm not going to use this in one thing or something, but I'm going to identify some people who use such sources for something, but I was just making some area where people can put in what they're doing."
At the same time, a burn has been loaded on the Lighthouse, which is on fire each year.
“ I think a lot of people are excited to get burnt on Friday night.
Of course, the only thing that makes a line in the account is that the prediction is no tape."
“This burn will burn, but it will only reveal how it will be,” says Anna Lilja.
You can listen to the interview with Anna Lilju in the player below.
Will Prince Andrew be mentioned in new documents about sex crimes?
British royal family is now preparing to respond to possible new information in the legal documents on his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
A U.S. judge has ordered that secret documents on Epstein and Maxwell be made public
Among the pages in these 80 pages of documents are parts of Maxwell’s testimony from 2016 onwards.
The display of this late may also place great pressure on Prince André, where there is communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015
Virginia Roberts, a alleged sexual slave of the humble American financier, claimed in 2015 that she had been forced to engage with Prince André.
Andrés Prince is now preparing to protect himself from the possible publication of information this week, with even more damaging accusations about his friendship with the child molester Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged insanity, Ghislaine Maxwell.
A U.S. district judge Loretta Preska appointed this week for the publication of 80 secret legal documents in connection with Maxwell and Epstein, which count hundreds of pages.
The display of these vastly extensive documents would be a shock to the 58 - year - old Maxwell, where they contain large portions of her testimony before lawyers in 2016, including what her lawyers have said to be “sudden questions” about her sexual history.
They could also put great pressure on Prince André, where one of the documents contains communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts, the alleged sex slave of the disgraced American financier, claimed in 2015 in legal documents that she had been forced three times to engage in a conversation with Andrew.
Andrew has repeatedly rejected these claims.
E-mails since 2015 that have been leaked and the BBC published last year appear to indicate that Andrés asked Maxwell for help in responding to Robert's claims.
We have no doubt that the duke will have a rebellion
There he said to the chief executive: “Tell me when we can talk, and I have certain questions I need to ask you about Virginia Roberts. ”
Maxwell replied: “I have information, so call me when you have a moment. ”
Last night, a source close to Andrew said: “The Lord of Jorvei has done nothing wrong, so we are not concerned about the opening of justice.
As the U.S. courts have tried to point out, this does not mean that the accusation is true, even though it appears in legal documents.
U.S. courts have encouraged the media and the public to take full care of the charges presented in legal documents.
We completely agree.
We have no doubt that the duke will have a full rebellion in the next few weeks."
Maxwell is now in custody at Manhattan’s detention center and is awaiting the trial to find and lure some of Epstein’s victims who were under legal age from 1994 to 1997.
It is also accused of being persuasive of refusing knowledge of a report on his abuse.
She's rejecting all the charges.
Maxwell last spoke to lawyers in April and July 2016 in connection with Roberts’jurisprudence, now under the last name Giuffre, which she took up after marriage.
Some 40 pages of a total of 418 pages of this testimony were made public last year, but after the decision of the judge Presna in New York last week, more items could be opened on Thursday at first.
Maxwell’s lawyers received one week of appeal.
Epstein was found dead in his prison cell in New York City last year when he waited for justice for sexual crimes.
Investigations are looking for a criminal gang after a violent attack on the streets of Edinborg.
Three attacked a man in the city of Eden and caused him to suffer injuries that could prove permanent.
The 29 - year - old victim was attacked in Drum Street, Gilmerton, between 23:00 and 23:30 on Saturday.
The Scottish police reported that he had been transferred to the Royal Hospital with serious injuries.
Investigator Dale Miles, who runs the study, said: “This was a violent attack and no cause for attack. ”
The suspects fled towards Newtoft Street.
One of them was thought to be in his 30 ’ s, about six feet [180 cm] tall and strong.
He was short - cut and dark - haired in white shirt, dark trousers, and dark shoes.
Detective Miles said: “I pray to all those in this area when the attack was made and saw something suspicious about surrendering. ”
The ambassador wants to carry a gun in Iceland.
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, U.S. ambassador in Iceland, wants to carry a gun on this land and wants to increase security.
He is said to have been “sustainable” about his safety since he arrived in the country last year.
This is stated in CBS’ report, which also states that this will Gunter, despite his working in “one of the world’s most secure kingdoms”.
Gunter is told to have asked the U.S. Foreign Ministry to hide from the Icelandic government that he should carry a gun.
Then he has asked for a armored car and a vest that protects him from knives.
However, CBS’s sources have repeatedly reported to Gunter that he is not at risk in Iceland.
The CBS report says that Iceland’s Foreign Ministry did not provide information on whether a request from the United States for a possible arms event on Gunter was received because the authorities do not express their views on the security measures of foreign rememberings.
Nevertheless, the publishers say that no request was made.
In that case, CBS has also been told by his sources that Gunter was told that he should not seek to carry a weapon, for it would be taken as an insult in this country.
Gunter, who has for years been a medical surgeon in California, has no experience of remorse.
He's working in the Republican Republic of the United States, and President Donald Trump's official.
He recently drew attention to the land when he coughed about the “invisible Chinese virus. ”
CBS’s sources also say that Gunter came down heavily on the agent of the U.S. embassy in Reykjavik.
He already had seven other members of the embassy from May of last year.
Among other things, he accused them of belonging to the so - called “Deep Kingdom, ” a network of U.S. officials working against Trump, and of responding angryly to one’s having snowed into his office.
The ambassador traveled to Washington DC in February for a conference and refused to return to Iceland for several months, according to CBS’s sources.
Gunter is said to have wanted to work from California, but at last Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, had to order him to return and do so in May.
The Home Game Form is key to Jose Mourinho, who says Tottenham has a easier game to come to when fans get to play again
With the help of Jose Mourinho, Tottenham Hotkör has not lost a game at home since the final team got back to work, but he says that it is much easier to keep a good gang at home if the audience was played.
Spurs has won 12 victories in the home field during this season, but it has lost four times — only one of the six more joints above it has lost more in the home field.
The coach Portuguese said that although such a victory walk was possible without the fans, it would be easier to maintain it if they were there.
“We have to do this with the fans, and without them we can build up some kind of work, where the playbook is in the foreground,” he said.
“ But I think it’s much more powerful to do this with the fans, because then the emotional sides of the game, which only comes with fans in the home stadium, will be added. ”
Mourinho believes that with stronger rivals, it will be harder to maintain the long periods of victory on a home site known to him from Chelsea, or that Liverpool has built up for the past three seasons.
But these are also key factors in determining whether the past reaches its goals at the end of the period, especially in equal games and neighboring laws, where the atmosphere of the field can divide.
“ I believe that the policy of the prime department is that it is becoming harder and harder now to strike these unspoken values because of what has become good. ”
“It is important, however, to be strong at home and, at the end of the season, to have brought in a number of ladders with winnings at home.”
“ I’m happy with the finals from home games lately, without the fans, but we need them back.
I see a victory against Arsenal with the field full of Tottenham fans.
It is compassion that is built up gradually."
Buyers excited about the pursuit of lifestyle property in Lovely Banks
The “greater is better, ” apparently, is the motto of the new owners of huge real estate in the city of Lovely Banks, sold recently at $1,270.
Interested buyers looking for a lifestyle property near the town of Geelong went to see these 1.35 hectares of land, where you can find a car rack for 14 cars, a swimming pool and a view of the Corio River.
Joe Grgic, a real estate agent in Harcourts, North Geelong, said that an offer on the property that Cuddihy Court 1 had been approved within 10 days of its placing on the market.
Broome Cottage in Ocean Grove back for sale
Home options for isolation
“ We received numerous offers from various parties, ” said Grgic.
"The money was sold to a homer who's very excited."
The property comes with four rooms on two floors, including a special bathroom large enough to accommodate a sofa.
The new owners have a choice of three rooms and can use an up - to - date kitchen with a view of the pool.
“ This was in the way the property was composed, that it was three squirrels, and that it was in this place, ” said Grgic.
“ There came interested merchants from Melbourne who wondered what the property was in the middle area but still with rural gangs.
“I have people who missed it and merchants who are still looking for it. ”
He said that the spacious storage area, which includes a double garage and a free - standing cover of 10 - 12 vehicles, was perfect for industrialists or for the storage of trailer and after - car vehicles.
A threat to their safety in Iceland
“ Despite being appointed as one of the safest countries in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been a vindictive of his safety since his arrival in Reykjavik last year. ”
This is how CBS News’s detailed discussion of the U.S. ambassadors in Iceland begins, but this reflects various sources of CBS from the United States Foreign Service.
The CBS report claims that Gunter, at the U.S. Foreign Ministry, requested that he be given special permission by the Icelandic authorities to carry firearms.
Then he should also have wished for a armored car, as well as for ideas about a vest that could protect him from knife attacks.
The U.S. State Department refused to state publicly whether Gunter’s security is truly threatened in Iceland, but according to information provided by officials, Gunter has repeatedly been told that he is in no special danger.
Despite this, the U.S. Embassy recently announced after lifeguards in full - time work, including at the July 18th of July, issue, but CBS reports that it is being done to cool Gunter’s concerns.
The U.S. Foreign Ministry does not express itself with regard to visible security measures in connection with its mission, but it always states that the objective is that security should be preventively guaranteed.
The Ministry does not answer questions about Gunter’s request to arm a weapon and the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not want to say whether the United States has formally requested that the ambassador be given a gun, and it does not normally express itself in the security of foreign agencies.
However, CBS, according to his Icelandic sources, has said that the request for this material has never been made, and according to three U.S. officials, Gunter was handed over to his plans, where they could offend the locals in Iceland.
CBS also discusses the various issues that have been related to the U.S. embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed ambassador last year, but he will have already replaced his vice-president seven times.
Thus, the first vice-holder is said to have prepared for his work for a long time and learned Icelandic only to have been denied the position at the last minute because Gunter “does not read it” at their first meeting.
His successors have not gone much better under Gunters.
Governments of the U.S. Foreign Ministry are conscious of the position of the mission in Iceland, but they are reluctant to intervene in matters related to the president’s close ties.
In addition, Gunter is said to be reluctant to comply with the various rules of the foreign ministry and to respect the order of power.
Gunter traveled to the United States in February to participate in a Washington convention, and is said to have refused to return to Iceland in the wake of his temporary localization for months, and in the middle of his pandemic.
Will Gunter have even wished to do his job in the distance, saying that he would not return to Iceland unless the foreign minister, Mike Pompeo, asked for it in particular.
According to information provided by the U.S. Foreign Ministry, Gunter had decided to take a personal authorisation at the end of the conference and the Cronine virus epidemic, but according to CBS, many members of the council have asked Gunter to return to Iceland, which he did not do until May, after Pompeo contacted him and kindly asked him to return to the embassy in Iceland.
The CBS report also reports on Gunter’s enemies in Iceland, especially in relation to the titres where he calls the crown virus “invisible Chinese virus” and has been critically criticized.
Gunter is one of many, almost inexperienced in the field of foreign service ambassadors appointed during the reign of Donald’s Trump President of the United States.
Sachsin Pilot against Ashok Gehlot; Bharatiya Janata Company says government crisis in the state; Congress wants a vote
Ashok Gehlot said that if needed, the Congress Party would have to deliver to a convention outside the home of Prime Minister.
On Saturday, the day after peaceful protests with Raj Bhawan, Jaipur, Ashok Gehlot, Prime Minister Raasthan, said that if needed, Congressmen would have to meet the President and pay for seat protests outside the Prime Minister’s home to lead the Crown into the state.
At the meeting of Congressmen, Gehlot indicated that a vote was planned to be held in order to see if the majority of the group’s representatives and the co - military forces were in the power struggle with him.
“ He said the government has the majority and wants to vote, ” says Mahesh Joshi, chief Congressman, after the meeting.
The assembly was held in a hotel, where the Senators who support Gehlot have stayed in the last days.
“ The prime minister asked us to be prepared to stay longer at the hotel.
If necessary, he said, would meet with the President and also hold peaceful protests outside the home of Prime Minister," said a party leader.
The prime minister, Rastashhan, may convene and have the Congress Party demonstrate his majority, said the party leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday, indicating that Bharatiya Janata's plan to overthrow the Ashok Gehlot government from the chair.
“ Land is now governed by law and constitution.
Governments are formed and work with the representatives of the people.
Bharatiya Janata’s plan has been exposed to the overthrow of Rajasthan’s government.
This is insulting the 80 million people of Rajasthan.
The prime minister must call the council together for the truth to come before the land," said Gandhi at the title of the Hindu.
Mr. Ashok Gehlot, the prime minister of Raasthan, told Congressmen on Saturday that he was prepared to attend the meeting of the President of India to ensure that what he calls “Bharatiya Janata’s advice” to delay the declaration of trust with a vote will not be accepted.
Gehlot, who protested for many hours at the home of the governor Kalrai Mishra on Friday to push a council meeting, met with Congress and government officials on Saturday and, after the meeting, were new proposals made and approved by the government.
Last night, Mr. Mishra asked Gehlot to return the request to meet the Congress and referred to six protests.
The permission will soon be sent to the governor.
Gehlot has accused the governor of delaying the Congress meeting, where he is “under pressure” to delay the vote that determines his government’s trust.
When Gehlot met his government, the Bharatiya Janata delegation, chaired by the leader of the Satish Poonia, and the leader of the Gulab Chandra Kataria, chaired by the governor, discussed the position of COVID-19 in the state.

Spencer Grammar played outside Manhattan's restaurant
NEW YORK – Spencer Grammar’s actress said he was trying to calm down an angry man when he cut her arm and put her friend in the back outside the restaurant in New York City last Friday.
Grammar, 36, told US Weekly that she and her friend had done what everyone else had done in the same situation that they had been trying to prevent the situation from getting worse when they were attacked.
Grammar and her 32-year-old friend sat down at the table at The Black Ant in East Village-town Manhattan about 23:30 a.m.
On Friday, when a man went up to them, and demanded to be delivered, the place was closed.
Grammar and her friend were injured when they tried to “dissolve a disagreement between an unknown man and other local guests, ” according to the police.
After hurting Grammar’s right arm, the man ran off and stabbed her friend in the back with an unknown pointed thing, said the police.
No one's been arrested.
Grammar, who speaks for Summer in the "Rick and Morty" and played earlier in the series "Greek" of the ABC Family, is the daughter of the "Frasier" star Kelsey Grammar and the actress Doreen Alderman.
Grammar said that both she and her friend expected to recover quickly.
Neither of them suffered serious internal injuries, she said.
In a statement to the US Weekly, Grammar thanked those who responded on the scene and the staff of the Bellevue Hospital who were concerned with them and spoke of the “unbelievable struggle” of this staff in their crown virus epidemic.
“ It touched us very much to have the opportunity to thank them personally, ” said Grammar.
“ I don’t want to be like McGregor and show my money...
I'm here to help people" – Chimaev after a historic evening at UFC Fight Island – RT Sport News
The Khamzat Chimaev fighter from Russia is now named as the next star of UFC after registering in the history of Fight Island, but he says he does not aim to flag his wealth in a tedious way like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev carried Colonel Rhy's McKee's North-Ian-Norwegian Rhy's Team in their battles to the Velocity of Abub Dabi on Saturday night when he won his contestant when three minutes and 9 seconds had passed the first round by having his blows hit him in the floor.
The victory recorded the name Chimaev in the UFC history books for the shortest time between winnings in the modern history of the contest, where only 10 days had passed since he won the British John Phillips in a similar way, then in a midway.
Chimaev, who has a winning ratio of 8-0, received 50,000 American benus for his evening performance against McKee and has captured the attention of the MMA world so fully that it is now called “Khalib 2.0”, which is said to be an inevitable comparison because of the magnitude of similarities between Chimaev’s superiority and the UFC Master’s light turn and being born in Téténia, which is near the home of Khabib in Dagestan.
Despite newfound fame and financial benefits, the translator Chimaev has said that he would not be willing to flag his wealth like the MMA money machine Conor McGregor or his peer in the box world, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
“ I’m not just doing this for me, I’m doing this for everyone I can help.
“ I don’t want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, showing my money or something like that.
I want to help people," answered Chimaev when he was asked on Fight Island how he would use the bonus.
He has, among other things, raised the attention of Conor McGregor’s teammate and active Twitter-user Dillon Danis, who wrote on the social media that he could “usually” defeat Chimaev with a surrender.
It did not contain a poisoned response from the battle contest under the name “Borz,” or “wolf” in his mother tongue, which said that he would“ paint Danis with his eyes closed. ”
Chimaev, now living in Stockholm, Sweden, after moving to the country at age 19, may not be able to take advantage of his financial power, but he is clearly insensitive to the fact that his fighting skills are plentiful.
“ I can grind anyone...
How many fighters are in the charity?
I can grind them all," he said.
“ Give me 77 kilos of master (wetful), 84 kilos of master (millivite), I'll grind them both, the same day. ”
Israel continues to protest the reaction of the prime minister to the pandemic
JERUSALAM (AP) — Thousands of Israel protested against the prime minister of the land on Saturday and were the greatest protest outside the official seat of Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
The protests have lasted for a few weeks, but they began because of what critics believe the government’s failure to respond to the chronic virus epidemic after initially coping with the threat of the virus.
The charges against Netanyahu for corruption have further promoted the protest.
“Bib, go home, ” stood on the sign of one of the Protestants.
Another card said: “Everybody sees that the emperor has lost his clothes. ”
Also, hundreds of Protestants gathered outside Netanyahu’s beach house in the wealthy city of Caesarea.
Last week, the police used guns to scatter groups in Jerusalem.
After what has been called a rapid and unorganised re-opening of economic life in May, the average number of new cases per day increased by 2000.
The economic situation of the country has been hit because of the virus limitations, and unemployment has increased by nearly 20%.
The Protestants say that the government’s financial assistance has not been enough.
The protests took place in the shadow of the trial of corruption charges against Netanyahah, who began again in the month.
The hearings will begin in January.

LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) — Some 300 protesters met in the middle of Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon to support two - month - old movements in Portland, Oregon, where attention was paid to federal police officers after fighting with protesters.
Similar protests took place in many parts of the United States, including Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York.
The protests in Los Angeles were organized by the Refuse Fascism and Youth Liberation Front groups.
The group went to the headquarters of the police in Los Angeles at First Street and Main Street and then to the headquarters of the city center.
The participants also moved to Alameda Aferin on the 101 highway, but they left it later.
Part of the people were seen breaking windows in federal buildings in the middle of the city, and culprits were written on federal markings.
At least one person was arrested in protests.
50 crowds of Mosques at Eid Festival and no prayer gatherings in Eidgah, tell the government in Karnata
The feast Eid-ul-Azha, or Bakrid, will be held on 31 July and 1 August.
The Government of Karnata has issued that only 50 people may meet in Moscow for prayer for Eid-ul-Azha, and have banned prayer meetings in Eidgah and other places due to the chronic virus epidemic.
Visitors who wish to pray in Moscow must wear masks and keep away, according to the orders of AB Ibrahim, the administrators of minor groups and Wakf.
The order states that the Hilal Committee decided that the Eid-ul-Azha festival, also called or Bakrid, was held on 31 July in the province of Uduppi, Dakshina Kannada and Kodana, but on 1 August elsewhere in the state.
It is stated in the decree that while prayer meetings are one of the most important rituals of Muslims at the Bakrid Festival, such events in Eidgah and other places will be banned because of the COVID-19 epidemic.
Prayers, however, will be allowed in muskes, provided that no more than 50 share in one.
More than that, the commission says that prayer is divided.
Prayer meetings should not be held anywhere else, such as meetings, social centers or “Shadi Mahal”, as it appears.
The Karnata authorities allow for the opening of temples, mosques and other prayer places for those who wish to pray from 8 June, provided that the protection of COVID-19 is well protected.
The U.S. ambassador wants an armed bodyguard
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, U.S. ambassador in Iceland, thinks his life is threatened abroad and wants to wear weapons.
At the beginning of 2020, the U.S. embassy announced the “bodyguard” bodyguard in Icelandic newspapers and actually used the English word bodyguard in the advertisement.
According to the information given by the ambassador, the main reason that these jobs were announced is that Ambassador Jeffrey Ross Gunter believes that his life is threatened in Iceland.
In Iceland and abroad, the ambassador has been convinced that he is in great danger and that he is of Jewish origin.
The threat is not as obvious, but the protesters said that Islamic terrorists had been mentioned as a threat.
The CBS TV station discussed the matter on its website this morning, and it has been pointed out by Washington authorities that Gunter is a persecutive, demanding to carry his own weapons, to have a full vest and armed escort, as well as bulletproof drivers.
According to CBS, Gunter has repeatedly been told that there is no threat and that the advertisement after “bodyguard” is only to cool Gunter.
According to the information provided by Kvävs, the positions had not been settled in June, but the application deadline ran into February.
According to the sources of Fire, these changes have not led to formal action by the U.S. embassy.
There has been no formal request for increased guarding or permission for life guards to walk around outside the walls of the embassy.
The Icelandic law states that this is permitted only by a special authority of the Chief of Police.
There is no information available about any kind of threat.
The latest report by the police officer is somewhat decisive in the field of terrorism.
There are no examples of terrorism in Iceland and no evidence that terrorism or extreme groups of people are working here.
The prerequisites for allowing an armaments of foreign residents’ embassies on the streets of cities and cities in Iceland, according to the sources of Fire, are not available.
Gunter raised considerable attention in this country when he shared the tens of U.S. Presidents and called COVID-19 "The China virus".
With the title, he then had the American and Icelandic flags.
A Seattle radioman who mocked Trump's response to protests now says he needs a gun after the Starbucks café below his apartment was destroyed – RT USA News
Paul Gallant has received a new point of view on violent protests after mocking the President of the United States in June for saying that the Anarchists were burning and robbing Seattle City.
All we had to do was move closer to the partner’s home.
“I feel like I have to buy myself a gun, because this will clearly continue to happen,” said Galant on Twitter on Saturday night after he saw that the lepers had “dead” the Starbucks café on the bottom floor of his apartment house.
“ That’s enough, it looks like a street party down the street from me, and it’s very angry now. ”
The situation was quite different when Trump complained last month that Seattle’s mayor was allowing violent protesters to take over the city.
“ These liberal Democrats are unspeakable, ” said the president.
“ The reptiles burn and rob our cities, and they feel only wonderful, even death. ”
Galant, co-leader of Danny & Gallant at ESPN, Seattle, replied with a title: “Go through there for curiosity last night and see neither fire, robbery, or death, relax.
Gallant said last night that the police had advised the residents to stay away from his apartment building where explosives could be found in the damaged Starbucks café.
He published pictures of the damage and said, “Well done, you idiots, ” and pointed out that he had also seen fire a few doorwives away.
"I don't know what's going on, but the cat and I are going to find out."
The reversal did not bypass people who were mocked at Galant for his previous opinion and coughed messages such as “Just relax on the salmon,” and “Well, maybe Trump was right”.
Jason Rantz, another Seattle radioman, said, “If we don’t finally go on this tour we talked about.”
Galant said to the joke: “Awake and see that a lot of people were whining to “slow down” to me. I laughed. ”
He said he was standing by his first statement as he had gone through the CHAZ self-government area of anarchist and although it was not as bad as it had been outlawed as.
“ So it was burned and robbed after all, ” he said, “divorcingly. ”
White Lines star Laura Haddock, 34 years old, in an apartment search with his 28-year-old lover, Tom Rhys Harries
Laura Haddock and her boyfriend, Tom Rhys Harries, started together at the scene of White Lines, which is about sighing and gossiping at Ibiza, but in a housing search during the past week, their reputation was second and quieter, away from the party’s nightlife.
The couple who play a sibling in the Netflix series were popularly seen looking at a magnificent rural farm in Oxfordshire, which is for sale at GBP 1.2 million.
They came to the area of the Range Rover, which Laura 34, drove, dressed with gallistical pants and a white shirt, and there they met, leading them on a tour of the five rooms of the house.
In White Lines, who was recorded in the last fall, Laura played the role of Zoe Walker, who met the darker side of Ibiza when she investigates the murder of her brother, the record nurse Alex, who is played by Tom, 28 years old.
They did not learn about their relationship until this month, less than a year from the end of Laura’s six - year - old marriage to Sam Claflin, who is known from the Hunger Games movies.
Together, the four - year - old son, Pip, and Margot, two - year - olds, have two - year - olds.
When they announced the divorce in August, Claflin 34, on Instagram, wrote: “Laura has decided to understand divorce, and we understand in love, friendship, and deep respect for one another, and will continue to cooperate in the training of our children.
Laura and Sam first met in 2011 in an audience test, and Sam, who has also played in Peaky Blinders, described their wedding in 2013 as “a most outstanding achievement of my life”.
Before Laura got her role in White Lines, she had played in the first Inbetweeners film, and in the criminal drama of The Capture from the BBC, which was shown last year, where she played the lawyer Hannah Roberts.
Tom played a role in the second Inbetweeners movie and in the series of Brittania from Sky.
Count too soon to claim another wave here on land
A pathologist in the pediatrics department says too soon to claim another epidemic wave.
Three new inland infections were detected in the National Hospital virology department yesterday, and dozens of them have become sick.
Two domestic infections occurred on Thursday, one with a man in his 30 ’ s, other with a man in his 20 ’ s.
Then there had been no infection since the beginning of the month.
Yesterday, three more domestic infections were detected, one of which had been at the Rey Cup at the Laugardal.
John K. Johannsson, an information officer of the police officer, says in a discussion with a news office that fewer samples had to be taken because of this infection than originally thought.
The second is a person who came to the country from abroad on July 15.
At that time, rules for a so - called “returner ” would have been valid.
Mr. Kamilla Rutt Sigfusdóttir, a specialist in the field of sickness at the National Medical Agency, says that, however, the person concerned has followed the old process.
His vision was negative at the time of his arrival in the land, but he was sick, who has come into isolation, and six have been put into quarantine.
They're all on their way to a sample, but two of them are beginning to show symptoms.
The third infection has then been associated with the older man who was diagnosed on Thursday, and 12 have been put in a place to be sick.
It has been shown that on the journey of a new variant of the crown virus, which has not been identified before in this country.
“ We don’t know exactly where this virus comes from, but we haven’t seen it before.
The one believed to have borne the virus to the country had been in Israel but also in other European countries."
It is too early to claim that the so - called second wave of epidemics has taken place on this land, as other countries in Europe fear.
“ While the majority is still dictable, it is not eating.
But we are on our toes and are watching, thinking about ways to react if something like this could happen."
Megan Fox communicates about the relationship
Megan Fox says he found his twin soul in the rapper Machine Gun Kelly.
“ As soon as I met him and looked into his eyes, I knew that.
I'm interested in constellations, and I immediately knew that my twin soul was being discussed," says Fox, 34.
“ A twin is when the soul has reached an adequate level of existence so that it can divide into two different bodies at the same time,” Fox explained.
“ So we are two halves of the same soul, I think.
I told him as soon as we met.
I found it right away."
“ When we had known him for two days, I asked him to meet me for lunch, and I taught him about the constellations and asked him out into his life.
I decided to go to the depth right away."
Machine Gun Kelly takes the same line, but they met during film shoots.
“ I had begun to hang out outside her trailer and hoped to see her.
She has the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen."
Only two months ago Fox left his husband to ten years old, Brian Austin Green.
They have three sons together.

While Kanye’s recent social media and a mass meeting he held last Monday, among other things, discussed the birth of his daughter North West and said that he almost killed her.
Then Kim stepped forward on Wednesday and published a message to his followers on Instagram, where she spoke about her husband’s illness, which is diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Kardashian West has not previously publicly communicated her husband’s illness, including her husband’s children and Kanye’s right to privacy when his health comes to her.

Increased weight in protest against racial rights in the United States
In the United States, Protestants have gone through streets to draw attention to racial rights.
Objections have lasted for two months in Portland, Oregon, since May 25 when George Floyd killed the Minneapolis police in Minnesota.
The Trump regime has sent FBI officers to Portland, which is still in the process of protest.
The Protestants are also protesting against the presence of the federal policemen in the city.
In Seattle, Saturday, the police used flash bombs and tear gas, arresting 45 people, after protesting in support of the protests in Portland, became disbanded in violence.
According to the police, more than 20 police officers were injured.
One died on Saturday night in Austin, Texas, when a gun was loaded into Black Lives Matter's claim flight.
The media reports that the man may have gone up to a car carrying an armed rifle before he was shot.
“ The point is, it’s terrible that someone should be killed in protests, ” said Steve Adler, mayor of Austin, in a statement.
Adler said that he was “heart and speechless. ”
In Lousville, Kentucky, a group of armed Protestants demanded justice in Breonna Taylor's case, a black woman who died in Louisville when police broke into her home, with permission to enter without knocking, and shot her.
Taylor's boyfriend had first shot at the policemen because he thought they were burglars.
One policeman has been fired for Taylor's death, but the other policemen have not been brought to justice.
The NFAC Presponsor, armed group of black rebels who have participated in the protests, is calling for more discretion in police murder investigation at Taylor.
According to police information, three NFAC members were injured on Saturday when a gun fired a fire at the rebel army.
Possible side-by-side co-infection
Five have been diagnosed with Covid-19 infection this week across borders.
Two of them were diagnosed with previously unseen virus variants and appear to be the source of three out of five infections to be completely unclear.
It is uncertain whether the individuals have been infected by a tourist who has left the country or by an asymptomatic Icelandic citizen who has probably infected more and more people.
The pathogen of the pathologist says that a possible co-infection may be associated with one of the infections.
Two people were diagnosed with Covid-19 on the country last Thursday, with both types of virus.
The source of the infection is still unclear.
Three were diagnosed with the virus yesterday; one was infected by one of those diagnosed on Thursday, one came to the country on July 15th, and the other was probably infected outside, but the third was also infected with an unclear source.
After sequencing in the Icelandic genetic analysis, it was found that the two individuals diagnosed with the virus are associated with a new variant that has not been identified previously in this country.
Kamilla Josephsdaughter, a specialist in the field of disease at the National Veterinary Office and the local representative of a health care professional, says that the Icelandic genetic analysis is now considering where the most likely this type of virus has come from.
“ The other case was similar to the virus currently in use in Switzerland, but not quite the same.
They're going to look at this and try to map it better and lead the bodies to what part of the world the infection comes from," she says.
“ It seems, however, to be on this side of the Atlantic Ocean. ”
Hence, the disease is free of the two that came up at the beginning of July and were traced to the United States.
Do you assume that this new species has come outside rather than to have jumped abroad?
“ Yeah, it’s different from what’s been found in the past that there’s really no chance that this was something going on here, ” Kamilla answers.
“ These individuals are all likely in some way to get to grips with a person who has just arrived somewhere outside, without knowing it himself. ”
It says that there is still no evidence of where these new viruses could have come from.
“ There could be a traveler who has left the country again, but it could also be someone who does not get symptoms and does not realize that he has been infected, and it could naturally result in more infections.
We'll be on our toes next few days to keep an eye on it."
“ Once again, there’s nothing yet that’s been done that’s a very good group infection.
But there are individuals who have been sick in connection with one of the infections yesterday, who have symptoms and have had a sample," Kamilla continues.
“ We haven’t yet produced the results.
Thus it could possibly be a secondary infection."
Do you assume that there is now a social infection?
“It’s not impossible.
It hasn't been lately, but it's not impossible because we don't know who's been using this infection in these individuals, who were diagnosed on Tuesday and on yesterday."
Could it be said that a new wave of the virus is about to start?
“ No, not yet.
But we naturally need to be very awake, and we need to keep in mind that there are so much limitations on how we can take a lot of samples from people.
We don't take samples from asymptomatic people, but first we're getting infections that seem untraceable, we need to be given a little looser hands by taking samples from people with symptoms," she says.
Thus, it can be expected that the National Hospital Infection and Virology Department will give in the sample in the next few days to try to map the situation in this area more closely.
Does the National Hospital have the ability to increase the number of samples on the domestic market and to make a check at the border?
“ Not unlimited, no.
Therefore, it is necessary to provide some basis for testing non-screening individuals; it must be symptomatic and symptomatic or suspected that someone who has recently arrived in the country or something like that," says Kamilla.
It points out that infection is still ongoing on the disease detected yesterday and that a great deal of work is now being done to obtain information on the individual’s travels.
It says that the origin of the indigenous infestations seems untraceable, but it does not rule out the possibility that some of those now infected may provide evidence that will eventually lead the infection team to the original infection.
The restaurant that most people know about but is one of the best
Not all people are in a position where the restaurant Bjargarsteinn is located and probably have more fans in the country than in the country if it is mentioned on TripAdvisor and on other pages.
People who have flown to the country to visit him have heard of him as no wonder.
Berglind Hjörrsdóttir, a food blogger and a cooking book writer, attacked Bjargarstein on the days and held water of interest
“ I don’t know where to start, because the restaurant Bjargarsteinn in Grundafði is a wonderful place to be.
The story of the house is one of the sweetest things I know, the food of ten, do not show off the worse end, and the wonderfully fun servants!" says Berglind.
“ Gunna, the owner of Bjargarstein, engulfed the precious right to one another in front of us.
My wife and I sat down with our girls all night, so it must be said how good the food was," Berglind adds.
“ The house in which the restaurant is fired is an old apartment house that was moved in whole on Grundlarfjärður.
Now the owners ran their eyes in this house for sale in Akranesi, and found a beautiful seabed in Grundvard, and made the dream come true.
Read more about the house's history on the Bjargarstein website."
“ The walls of the house and all the surroundings of the stone of Bjargar are unique.
The whole family has been gathered together, and it certainly puts its share in the home.
On the top floor is a living room and really cosy and homely entering this wonderful restaurant.
The quality and the cooking process then do not hide, and it is clear that much is put into the magic of tasty and beautiful restaurants," Berglind says, and as a goal the pictures can be lied to.

According to the Danish national radio, DR, the Danish court spokesperson of the Danish court states that the prince, 51 years old, may not be able to stay in the hospital, but his feelings are constant.
The report DR says that the effect of the blood clot on the health of the prince is now being investigated.

Google Pixel 4 can form the galaxy
Double optical attraction enables the extra lens of Pixel 4 to be seen in a three-dimensional way, thereby providing a better backdrop with facial configuration than in previous Pixel-phones, which trusted the alpha in software to achieve these so-called “bogeh” effects.
In order to demonstrate the quality of the camera, Google mythic photographer Annie Leibovitz was given up on the field to discuss his experience in photography with Pixel 4 in the last 12 months.
A machine study is still on the foreground of all aspects of a new Google smartphone, and on this phone is a new “computer photo” to improve the HDR+ setting by uniting up to nine different images.
New dual lighting controls offer different slides for brightness and shade and allow users to preview HDR+ in real time.
The phone also relies on a robotic exercise to offer better automatic whitening and to improve Night Sight night setting, which is so sensitive that it can capture the Milky Way in the night sky.
In addition to other camera images, Pixel 4 Soli presents "martse filter" on the front of the phone, which distinguishes Motion Sense motions so that users can let go, turn off time indicators, turn off alarm or turn off phone sounds by waving their hand.
All Motion Sense calculations are carried out in the device instead of connecting to the Internet, as is the case for a improved Google helper, where the technician is now focusing on shortening the response time and improving the personal protection of users.
Continuing Google’s emphasis on full use of machine learning has also led to a new voice recording app that formats live audio without sending data on the Internet.
The app is available in English only, but more languages are expected.
Pixel 4 will also be the first phone to support Google Stadia, the cloud playground that will be launched from the 19th of November, in the United States, but will still announce the date for Australia.
In addition to a new Pixel phone, Google also introduced new Pixelbook Go Chromebook computers and the second generation Google Pixel Buds hearing aids.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart listener tool, which is expected next year, is completely wireless and has sound correction that listens to the environment and keeps the sound in line to make the explanation the most.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart listener tool is completely wireless and sets the volume according to the noise around you.
Google also reported an update of its connected Wi-Fi home bones in the Nest WiFi line with a special bone along with many base locations working together to improve wireless connectivity within the home.
The new Wi-Fi system, which will record the Nest name, doubles its predecessor and adds built-in microphones and speakers to use the Google helper at each home base.
It's selling in Australia on November 5th, and it costs $399 for the bone and one Wi-Fi point or $549 for two Wi-Fi points.
Google Home Mini has also been updated, but a new 79 dollar Nest Mini improves sound quality by double the bass and has got built-in wall fixation.
All Google Smart Speakers will receive a new Call System Characteristics for communication between devices in the home as well as the ability to call Nest Mini outside the home using the Google Home app.

Houses burned, shops robbed and internal damage
More than sixty are dead and sixty more wounded after an attack in the village of Masteri, in the Darfur region of Sudan yesterday.
The attack “was the latest in series of serious safety incidents in the last weeks, where houses were burned, shops, and markets were robbed and damaged, ” says a statement by the United Nations Humanitarian Office in the capital of Kartum, sent out today.
Abdalla Hamdok, Prime Minister of Sudan, has published that security forces are being sent to the armed forces of the province to “protect the inhabitants and the harvests. ”
Only two days since the unknown army in the area killed at least 20 public citizens, including children, in another attack.
“The increase in violence in various parts of the Darfur region is leading to an increase in pollution, it puts agricultural resources at risk and threatens the lives and lives of people,” states the United Nations.
The conflict in Darfur, in the western part of Sudan, began in 2003 when the rebels, most Arabs, rose against the governor of Cartum.

A TV reporter thanks an audience for their attention to cancer
TAMPA, Florida (AP) — A TV reporter in Florida thanks to an observer’s observations for having noticed a lump on her neck and sent her e - mail that she should have him checked.
Victoria Price, a WFLA reporter in Tampa, went to this advice and was diagnosed with cancer.
Price told Twitter that she had surgery on Monday to remove the tumor, thyroid gland, and a few lymph nodes.
“ The doctor said it was spreading, but not too much, and we are hopeful that this will be my first and last operation,” she said.
The viewer sent Price an e - mail last month and said that the node reminded her of the node she had had.
Price, who is a 28-year-old researcher, said this week that her TV station's slogan was "8 for you".
“ But the role of an audience with MÉR recently got mixed up, and I couldn’t be more grateful, ” said Price.
“ I will always be grateful to the woman who made an effort to send me an e - mail, a completely ignorant woman.
She had no obligation to do so, but she did.
Talking about being with a man on the team."
