AM in Wales is worried that "becoming like a dick"
Some AM, members of the Wales National Assembly, is confused by a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Wales Parliament).
The proposal will change the name of the National Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
AM across the entire political spectrum is worried about being mocked.
An AM for Labour said his group was worried because "it rhymmar with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who can't Welsh: Twp means stupid in Welsh and pwp means bajs.
An AM for Plaid said that the group in general was "dissatisfied" and has proposed other options.
A conservative wave reader said that his group is "open" for the name change, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W in Welsh is spoken like the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, who is currently compiling legislation for the change of names, said: "The final decision for what members of the congregation should be called is of course up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh congregation the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support in calling the Assembly the Wales Parliament.
The title of AM was in force, but MWP received the greatest support in a public consultation.
The AM clearly proposes other options, but problems with reaching a consensus can cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the change within a few weeks.
Legislation for the amendments also includes other changes for how the Assembly works, including rules for disqualification of an AM and the design of the comitology system.
AM is allowed to vote on what to call them when they debate the legislation.
Macedonia is holding a referendum on the change of the country's name
On Sunday, the voters will vote on whether to change the name of the country to "The Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is an attempt to end a dispute that has been going on for decades with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, opposes the referendum on the change of names and has said that he will disregard the outcome.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of names is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's silence when the churches in Harlem encounter problems
"Elder people I'm talking to say there was a bar and a church on every corner of the past," said Mr. Adams.
"Now there's no such thing as "or."
He said it's understandable that the bars go away.
"People hang out with people in other ways these days," he said.
"Barer is not like the living room of the area anymore, where people go on a regular basis."
The churches in question he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be sufficient as far as the leaders expect and that "early or later they will end up on square one again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments filled with people who do not help remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to the closure of all the churches, because those who move into the apartments will probably not be members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist Assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had a nearby church took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when pastor Johnson's assembly planned the renovation they also built the watch game.
Pastor David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the music game "The Watches of the Poor."
The expert who played the watch game in July had another name for it: "A cultural treasure" and "An irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first watch game played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the larger watch game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's not replaced him.
The events of recent months at St. Martin's are a complicated story with architects and entrepreneurs – some who have been hired by the church's playthings, others by the episcopal lead.
The Church Meeting – the congregation’s governing body consisting of laymen – wrote to the Foundation in July and expressed concern that the Foundation would “try to transfer the cost” to the church meeting, even though the church meeting had not been involved when the Foundation hired architects and entrepreneurs.
Some congregation members complained about a lack of transparency from the pin.
Shark damage 13-year-old diving for lobster in California
Last Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was dying for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack took place just before 7:00 in the morning, near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy call for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy was just glad to have found a lobster, but then he realized that the boy screamed, "I've been bitten!"
"I've been bitten!"
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he noticed that the entire key bone had been worn up.
"I cried to everyone to get out of the water. 'There's a shark in the water!' said Hammel.
The boy flew to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is stated to be critical.
It's not clear what shark it was.
The swimkeeper Larry Giles told the mass media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim suffered trauma damage to his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's getting into Britain's beauty market
Sainsbury's takes on Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with departmental beauty walks with beauty specialists.
As part of a significant push into the UK beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the fall of the fashion and domestic market, the larger beauty walks will be tested in 11 stores country over and implemented in more stores next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the supermarket's attempts to fill the shelves previously taken up by TV sets, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said they're going to double their beauty offer to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing offers from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have greater space with selected areas, as in stores like Boots.
The store chain also re-launchs its boutique brand so that most of the products are vegan – which is increasingly young customers require.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test stand in two Sainsbury's stores – the first stand opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend to buy less food every day in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their stores will look more and more like warehouses in an attempt to fight against cheap shops like Aldi and Lidl with more services and other products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos-stand in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitat-stands since they bought both chains two years ago, which according to them has increased sales of food and made acquisitions more profitable.
The purchase's previous attempts to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a facial elevator failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a dispute about how the revenues from Boot's sales in supermarkets would be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
They claim that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an extended range of luxurious skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial manager, said: "We have given our beauty walks a new look and a new feeling to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can advise customers.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all needs, and with an attractive environment in smooth locations, we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way to shop."
Peter Jones "raises" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the deal of £11 million
Dragons The star Peter Jones is "racial" that the TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdraws from a $11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
Their activities have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
This Morning representative, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons The star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle brand in the last minute – to focus on his new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources Jones was "fast" at an exciting meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire last Tuesday when the TV favorite admitted that her new agreement – worth up to £1.5 million – meant that she no longer focused on their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated property of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she left Truly on Instagram flew Jones to one of her holiday homes.
A source said, "Truly was clearly Holly's top priority.
It would be her long-term future for the coming decades.
Her decision to withdraw shocked everyone involved.
No one could think it happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold at the headquarters of Marlow."
Experts believe that This Morning representative's decision to withdraw can cost the company several million because of significant investment in everything from pillows and candles to clothes and the risk of further delays in launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role as president in March.
The couples are vacationing together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become M&S brand-and-replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm a Celebrity on ITV.
A source near Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business."
"And then we fell in love"
He was joking that the media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider to be "unworthy of a president" and that he was so positive of North Korea's leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a "news angry voice":
"I haven't given up anything."
He said that Kim wants a second meeting after Trump celebrated their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have taken place.
More than three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diploma Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "equivalent response" from the United States after North Korea's first disarmament step.
He noted that instead, the United States continued to impose sanctions designed to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his followers.
"The North Korea's doing great," he said.
"We were on our way to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a sovereign relationship."
He said that his attempts to improve the relationship with Kim have had positive results – an end to rockets, freed hostages and returned remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this full-packed arena, we would have about 200 people here," said Trump and pointed to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake destroys island in Indonesia, hundreds die
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the Lombox population had lost their homes, there was no exception, which is required for international aid.
"In many cases they have, unfortunately, been very clear about their not asking for international help, which complicated everything," said Ms. Sumbung.
Save the children gathering a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear if foreign staff can work there.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesperson of the Natural Disaster Bureau, said that Indonesian officials evaluated the situation in Palu in order to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the aid work.
In view of the constant earthquakes of Indonesia, the country is still deeply unprepared for the anger of nature.
It has been built tsunami protection in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The absence of a tsunami alert in Palu, despite the fact that a warning had been issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia's many islands.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital vessel that has been anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia's worn infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and rails.
But insufficient funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration for next year's election.
Mr. Joko is also pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, bows, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge signed up last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a target in the 89th minute of Stamford Bridge in London last Saturday.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's target when his team lay behind with 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick at the back of the pole.
The experiment flew high across the target area towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell over the hope of Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended up in the net.
"I was just trying to end up in a position to access the ball and players like Shaq are always playing forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante getting closer and didn't think so much about it, but I just kicked it."
Chelsea led by 1-0 after the first half after a goal for 25 minutes from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker poured a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, spinning off near the middle field and sprinted to the Liverpool side.
Kovacic did a quick give-and-go at the center field.
Then he got a sovereign kick that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard ran away from the defense and got the ball in the net at the remote pole with a left foot kick past Liverpool Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea is faced with VIdeoton in the Uefa Europa League in London at 15:00 a.m. on Thursday.
Death figures for tsunami in Indonesia rise to 832
The death rate for the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster agency early on Sunday.
Many people were reported to have been stuck in the ruins of buildings that broke into the 7.5 earthquake, which struck on Friday and triggered waves of up to six meters, said the firm's spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was full of rush from buildings that were demolished.
The police are arrested, 32 suspects of murder after a woman is cut to death.
A murder investigation has started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with a knife wound on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect for murder.
The police have asked people in the area who saw or heard something to appear.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "We are at an early stage of the investigation, but I ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask all, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information that is crucial for our investigation."
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the woman found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police inform the next relative of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to enter his apartment, but the police said that no one can enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The accommodation in the building has been informed that it takes several hours to re-enter.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman showed up at the scene.
She says "it's so terrible" over and over again.
At 2 p.m., there were two police cars inside the lockdown and another one just outside.
A number of police assistants were inside the fence with an overview of the apartment building.
People with information are asked to send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestopper anonymously on 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell's latest victims of an argument on the rewriting of history
A ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion "dreaming" and "try writing about history."
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace should be dragged into the ongoing debate on removing statues."
The Iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the opinion of the 1800s and is part of historiography of a man who many believe should still be praised.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more in the late 1800s than now, believe that Cromwell defended Parliament against external pressure, in his case from monarchy.
If this is a proper representation, it is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the mid-19th century has undoubtedly affected the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person who represents one side of the matter.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be hailed and celebrated.
Killer pigs kill pawns
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in south-west China, according to local media reports.
The man, who was only identified by his last name Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood in a path on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccine into pigs in a pig stia on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He is reported to have traveled with his cousin from neighboring province of Yunnan in Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a pig's trail nearby was open.
He said there was a big pigghan in the piggstian with blood on his mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kilos heavy pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and twisted," said the cousin who was identified by the last name Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig who killed the farmer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to avoid more attacks while the police collected evidence at the site.
Yuan's family and those responsible for the market are reported to negotiate compensation for his death.
It's rare that pigs attack people, but it's happened before.
2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and caused serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 pounds [300 kg] stuck a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it off.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012 a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "catalyst".
"They're just playful.
They're very curious and they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
The rest of Hurricane Rosa for vastly heavy rain to the southwest United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker when it travels over cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring overwhelming rain to northern Mexico and the south-west of the United States for the coming days.
Rosa had a wind force of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at five EST on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a tram will begin to be formed across the Pacific Ocean and will travel east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture north into the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will carry up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture that interacts with the nearer step will create vastly heavy rain in the south-west of the United States in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5–10 cm rain will cause dangerous floods, clay flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5–7.5 cm rain per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5-10 cm rain is expected in some parts of the south-west of the United States, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered tropical rain.
It is certainly not recommended that someone get into the desert on foot when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rain can make canyons rushing rivers and thunderstorms lead to strong local winds blowing around sand.
The approaching trawl will certainly bring local heavy rain to parts of southern California's coastline.
It is possible with a total of over one cm of rain, which can lead to clay flows and tail roads.
That would be the first rain in the area during the rain season.
Some shivering tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain becomes more wide later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October can mean intense temperature changes throughout the United States, when the Arctic is cooled down but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in central America on Sunday.
There is almost ten degrees of difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to get a warm start on October with around 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of the north-east United States.
New York can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about five degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a great chance for warmer temperatures than the average in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million watching Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million were watching Thursday's arresting testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault that should have taken place in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued and the normal broadcast was suspended for Friday's last minute-twist – Arizona Senator Jeff Flake's agreement with the FBI where they got a week to investigate the accusation.
Ford told Sate Judiciary Committee that she is absolutely sure that Kavanaugh tipped her when he was drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said he's absolutely sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers on Friday was higher than the 20.4 million indicated by Nielsen.
They counted the average number of viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available to other TV networks showing the interview, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has problems counting people who watch from offices.
Comparatively, there are as many viewers as for a football game in the playoff or Oscarsgalan.
Fox News Channel, whose representatives have shown strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, had most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC had the next 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was in focus during Friday's drama.
After the Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS filmed demonstrators screaming at him when he tried to take an elevator to an interview with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the demonstrators screamed at him, as was shown in the live broadcast of CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors were closed he said he would have more to say after the hearing with the committee.
The TV networks sent live several hours later when Judiciary Committee voted if they would pass on Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the entire Senate.
But Flake said he was only going to do it if the FBI were to investigate the charges against the nominated one in the next week, as the minority Democrats have claimed.
Flake was partly convinced by his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political games" around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" about the future of Britain and to undermine the interest of the nation in an interview with the Sunday Times.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front of the newspaper, her former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson, continued her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that the proposal for the UK and EU collection of each other's customs duties was "completely unreasonable".
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrests suspect Dyteon Simpson for the LSU player's death
The police have arrested a suspect for the death shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for murder, the police in Baton Rouge said.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses in the battle.
The police found the glasses on the site and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After questioning with Simpson, the police said he confessed he shot Wayde to death.
His bail was fixed at $350,000, according to Advocate.
The court doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a bullet wound in the head and into the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police's prison security force, the police state justice lab, the South University police and residents in the area for assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "skill and quest for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98 meters long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Last Friday morning LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "broken" and "chockat" by Wayde's death.
"You're worried about this all the time," said Wade.
Vulkan asks ashes over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatépetl has reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned on Saturday's Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity had been discovered in the crater and the registered 183 gas and ash spills over the course of 24 hours.
The center discovered several boulders and baldness.
Social media images showed thin layers of ash on windshields in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have noted increased activity in the volcano that stands 72 km southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 affected central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police join forces with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independent vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after independence demonstrators joined the CSR, while thousands of people participated in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on session.
A group of masked separatists that were held back by the crawler threw eggs and paint powder on them, which led to dark ponds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Battles also broke out later during the day and police used their Batons to stop them.
For several hours, the Independence Groups cried out "never forget, never forgive" while the Unionists cried out "long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries caused by the protests, according to local press.
The atmosphere is still tense in the region that longs for independence one year after the referendum on the first October, which was considered illegal by Madrid but was hailed by Catalan separatists.
An overwhelming majority voted in favour of independence, but participation was low when the majority opposed the session boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when the police tried to stop the vote at election stations in the region.
Independence groups camped during the night of Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but was forced to take another route.
The electrician Narcis Termes, 68, took part in the stand-alone protest with his wife and said that he no longer believes that Catalonia will be independent.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy to be able to vote, but now we've been stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal profit in regional elections in December, Catalan parties who are for independence have had difficulty holding the momentum up this year, when many of their most well-known leaders live in self-preserved exile or are in custody awaiting trial of their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his cell phone, said that the conflict had been lit up by politicians on both sides.
"It gets more and more tense," he said.
Last Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year, announced that he is going to be a candidate in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Candidate to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the subjugation we have experienced from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving into the house
Three men – 33, 34 and 39 – have been arrested after a car was driven into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 7:30 BST on Thursday.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building themselves were damaged.
An armbrush may also have been fired against the car.
Menga gives Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the profits
Livingston shocked Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrd to his second loss of 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's strike proved to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was divided two with Hibernian.
Gerrard's site has still not received a win in Premiership this season and meets Hearts, with eight more points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers Rapid Vienna welcomes the European League on Thursday.
Livingston extends his payline to six games – the main trainer Holt has still not experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against two visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead far before they made goals; their straightforwardness gave Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his performance across the target, and then Alan Lithgow could just shoot wide after gliding in to measure Craig Halkett's whining across the target.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, as they knew they could attack in certain games.
And that's how the decisive goal was done.
Rangers gave up a hairdressing park and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to give Menga a chance, which made goals from the middle of the target area.
In this situation Rangers had dominated the ball, but the defense of the home team was impenetrable and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely left in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Rangers goalie Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot wide from another of Livingston's definite game.
Crossings constantly entered Livingston's target area and were handled without problems. Two penalty requirements – after Halkett's challenge of the exchanger Glenn Middleton and one by hand – were dismissed.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal display and results for Livingston.
Every single one was outstanding and continues to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their playing style and staff have hardly changed since they returned to the upper level, but Holt deserves the honor of having galvanized the team since their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
The captain Halkett was outstanding and led a skilled organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worralll all the way through.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their moments under Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball did not hold the measure – they only opened the home page once – and it is something of a wake-up watch for Rangers, located in the middle.
Erdogan receives a mixed welcome in Cologne
The Saturday hosted the smiles and blue sky (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – to repair the relationship between the NATO Allies.
They have become discouraged by human rights, freedom of the press and the entry of Turkey into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world's largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police argued that they prevented 25 000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurdish – also made their voices heard and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to Germany.
The dulling protests show the fragmented views of a visitor who is considered a hero of certain German Turks and condemned as a sole ruler of others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in a crash by car
A cyclist has died in a crash with a car in London.
The crash took place near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-trafficd road in Deptford in south-east London, around 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped the car and the health care professional was called there, but the man died on the site.
The crash takes place a few months after another cyclist died in a contagion accident on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the crash last Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said they're trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Roads have been blocked off and buses have been redirected and drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in the tumult
Six prison guards have been injured in unrest at a high-security prison for men, according to the Prison Office.
The unrest broke out at the HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialized "tonado guards" have been called there to deal with the unrest involving eight prisoners on a wing.
The guards were treated on site for minor damage to the face.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison staff have been sent there to handle the ongoing incident at the HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for damages.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those behind it will be attributed to the police and may be subject to increased prison sentences."
The HMP Long Lartin accommodates over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, the Cinderella police were called to prison to deal with serious concerns in which personnel were attacked by billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with floods (areas with droughts can benefit)
It is rare that tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy draws across the desert in the south-west of the United States, with the risk of sudden flooding.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, and bring rain late on Monday.
National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of Arizona's border".
National Hurricane Center's latest models predict 5-10 cm rain, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in Mogolon Rim in Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the south-west United States, including central Rocky mountains and Great Basin, probably get 2.5–5 cm rain at risk for up to 10 cm.
In areas without risk of sudden floods, Rosa's rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
The floods are very serious, but some of the rain will probably be useful because the southwestern United States suffers from drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reportedweather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first cross the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane strength this Sunday morning with a maximum wind power of 135 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north for 20 km/h.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, which calms it down.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico's land mass as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Part of Mexico can have heavy rain, which is a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 7.5–15 cm of rain is expected from Baja California to Northwest Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm", reported Weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm and reach Arizona's border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very heavy rain in Baja California, north-west Sonora and the desert in the south-west US", said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and clay flows in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsome Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three boys in their teens and a 20-year-old man has been arrested as suspects for attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST this Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the situation reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the area of Radstock, said the police in Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking anyone who might have filmed what happened to the cell phone to come forward.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "led, mean, anger" from the democratic party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the democratic party's disrespectful and scandalous tactics," said Trump to his followers in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered "the evil, the anger" from the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified to the Congress of Thursday and strongly denied Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he sexually committed himself to her several decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified before the Congress about his accusation.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw the brilliant and quality and fashion of Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of our times' best legal minds, a lawyer with a first-class history of public service," he said to his followers in the audience in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republicans voting in the coming midterm electures.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I can't do it, but I can't do it," he said.
"That's why I'm going around fighting for sovereign candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are trying to "stand and prevent".
The first decisive vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds of dead in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, numbers are rising
At least 384 people died, many were swept away when giant waves crashed against the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu last Friday when up to six meters high waves crashed against the beach at dusk and swept out many to a safe death and destroyed everything in its path.
Tsunamine came after an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami came yesterday, people stopped on the beach instead of running from there immediately, and they fell victim to tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of Indonesia's Disaster Agency GDPB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"Tsunami was not alone but towed cars, logs and houses. It hit everything in its path," said Nugroho. He also said that the tsunami had travelled on the open sea for up to 800 km/h before the affected coastline.
Some climbed up into trees to get away from the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
The photographs released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and have collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
Aftershock still hit the coastal city this Saturday.
The line of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesia Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology BPPT said in a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake last Friday was 200 times the atomic bomb released on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made the tsunami larger, according to the Agency.
Nugroho described the devastation as "wide" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found during the rush of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and injuries can be even worse along the coast line 300 km north of Palu, an area called Dongela, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication from Dongla "was totally paralysed without any information", said Nugroho.
"There are over 300 000 people there," said the Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was criticized on Saturday for not having informed that the tsunami had attacked Pau, but the authorities said that the waves had appeared within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man upstairs in a building shouts Frenetic warnings about tsunami to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water crashes against the beach and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a massive blackout that interrupted all communications around Palu, which made the rescue work of the authorities difficult.
The military has begun to send cargo flights from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated people are still in great need of food and other supplies.
The city’s airport has been opened for the relief work and remains closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Members of the World Vision in Dongila have gone to Palu, where they seek protection during tarpaulins in the farm outside the office, but they saw devastation along the way, according to Mr. Dosaba.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Assistance groups have begun the assisted work, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
In accordance with Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and employees from abroad may only be used if an exemption permit is announced after a disaster.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the authorities say it is a national disaster, we can let in international aid, but that status has not yet been announced."
When the second night fell in Pau after Friday’s earthquake and Tsunami’s family and friends of missing people were still hoping that their loved ones would prove to be the miracles that brighten up the bleak natural disasters.
Last Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
Last Sunday, the rescue workers saved a woman who was stuck in a hurry for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, Indonesia’s National Screen Flying Team trainer, had trained two of the missing screenshots for Asian games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Manduni, were his students.
"As I do, I have my own emotional burden, as I do," he said.
Mr. Gendon told me that the hours after the screen pilots heard that Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he desperately sent whatsApp messages to the Pau participants who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages only got a gray bock, instead of two blue.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26 750 during ATM filling at Newport on the Living
Last Friday morning, thieves stole $26, 750 from a Brink's co-workers who filled a ATM at Newport on the Living, according to a press release from the police in Newport.
The car's drivers had emptied a ATM in the entertainment facility and would deliver more money, said detective Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While he was busy "spoke another man behind Brink's co-workers" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the site, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
Everyone who has information on the identity of the perpetrators shall contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapparen renames Ye
The Rapparen Kanye West changed its name – to Ye.
He announced the change of name on Twitter on Saturday and said, "The creature that is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title for its eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the program, who set out for "expert reasons" according to the programme creators.
Ye is a abbreviation of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he talked about the title of his album with the radio values of Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means 'one', to only Ye – a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a mirror of who we are."
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously co-operated with West, has previously written his name with and without binders and capitals.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use military against civilians
Mexico's recently elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the military against civilians now that the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody retribution against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza this Saturday that "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
The troops fired weapons against a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, and killed up to 600 people during an era when left-wing student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans with monthly grants to students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and poor educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double AI funding
Now that China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in the field, according to the inventor and AI users Kai-Fu Lee, who have worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment will come after several parts of the US Government have made statements about AI, despite the fact that the US does not have an overall formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of becoming a leader in AI innovation before 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, considering that all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for the next breakthrough within AI," said Lee.
A double budget can double the chance that the next big AI breakthrough will be made in the United States, Lee said to CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published earlier in the month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most outstanding AI companies – Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s he worked on an AI system that beat the highest rated American Othello player, and later he was in charge of Microsoft Research and was CEO of Google's China department.
Lee mentioned previous technology competitions from the US Government, such as Robot Challenge from Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what the next one would be in order to identify future visionaries.
In the United States scientists often have to work hard to get grants from the government, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders from us, but the companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired leading personalities from universities to work at AI.
Lee said that new immigration policies can also help the United States with the AI innovation.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctoral students in AI," he said.
The State Council in China issued its development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation grants grants to people in academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government agencies awarding money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and academic worlds, and White House announced the formation of Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
US legislation that would create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not made any progress in months.
Macedonia's referendum on the change of names
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum in case the name of the country should be changed to "The Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a number of decades old dispute with Greece which has prevented the country from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia which claims that its northern neighbour is a requirement on its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change of name would undermine the identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has led to doubt if the minimum participation of 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid will be achieved.
The question of the rollover in the referendum is as follows: "Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
However, the adherents of the name exchange, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is worth renaming if it allows Macedonia, one of the countries that was formed when Yugoslavia was split, to join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but sufficient Members of Parliament have said that they intend to follow the outcome for it to be considered decisive.
The exchange of names requires a majority of two thirds of Parliament.
According to the State Election Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 1:00 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in the referendum in Macedonia on the country's change of name, which would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Outside the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organised a small scene and place for chairs in front of the tents set up by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go with our heads in the air, not sneaking through the back door," said Kavardarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership would lead to well-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that the absolute majority will vote 'yes' because over 80% of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," said Zaev when he voted.
He said that a yes result would be a confirmation of our future.
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Policy Survey Institute, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters were voting in the referendum, which is below the minimum participation required.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of participants were intending to vote on Sunday.
70% of them were going to vote 'yes'.
In order for the referendum to count, 50% of registered voters plus one vote must be taken.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious setback for the policy of the Western directed government since it took over in May last year.
Watching: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero takes his way through the entire Brighton defense to make goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made Brighton's suggestions in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England last Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored for the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a pass from the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and got out into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around a defender and ran away from several others at the edge of Brighton's target area.
Then he pushed a pass to Sterling to the left.
The English forwarder used his first kick in the target area to give back the ball to Aguero, who used the right foot to beat Brighton's goalie Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero has trouble with his feet," said City's manager Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
"We talked about him playing for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he made goals at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial takeover in the Premier League match.
The target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's revir on that game.
He sent off a nice kick along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple kicks and led Sterling to the other pole.
Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net moment before it ended up out of range.
City meets Hoffenheim in the group game of the Champions League at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from the playoffs, so there was no reason to force one to start.
But Scherzer's competition-oriented wants to throw on Sunday towards Colorado Rockies, but only about Rockies, which is a match before Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still has a chance for the endgame.
Rockies got a wild card place with a win of 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but is still looking for its first division title.
"We're playing about nothing, but we can get a chance to rub gum in the knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the other team would play at higher level than any other team I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be there?"
Nationals have not announced their start for Sunday yet, but according to reports they are leaning against letting Scherzer throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, warmed up in the plunger on Thursday and would throw on his normal day of rest.
Washington's right-handed caster is 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds numbers in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation of Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he spoke of the importance of Republicans voting in the coming midterm electures.
"All that we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ... I can't do it, but I candidize. That's why I go around and fight for sovereign candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see a terrible, terrible group of radical democrats, you see it happening here and now.
They are determined to take power back whatever it takes, you see their evilness, their terribleness.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take over power and control, that's what they want, power and control.
Democrats, he said, fighting to "stand and stop".
"You've seen that in the last four days," he said and called the democrats "arga and mean and horrible and false."
He mentioned the democratic senator Diane Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was treated by the high bow of the spectators.
"Do you remember what she said?
'Did you cover the document?'
'Eh, eh, huh?
No, no, no, I'm expecting a...' It was really bad body language, something of the worst body language I've ever seen.'
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They do not tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a series of Labour MPs to hear that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament Joan Ryan was treated in a similar way when she stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on the security of the nation, on Europe – ironically similar topics that Jeremy criticised previous leaders of.
In the communication on the meeting with Nottingham East Labour this Friday, it said that "we want the meetings to be welcoming and productive".
For most of my eight years as a Labour's local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been exactly that.
But unfortunately, many meetings are not, and the promise of "better, more gentle" policies has been forgotten a long time ago, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerated within Labour, and every opinion is judged based on whether the leaders of the party accept it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues I previously thought had a similar political view that I expected I would make a whole conversion and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed on – whether it was the security of the nation or the internal market of the European Union.
Every time I speak publicly – and it really doesn't matter what I say – follows a tithe of the ovum on social media that requires me to be set aside, criticises middle policy and says that I shouldn't even be in Labour.
And this isn't just going to happen to me.
In fact, I am more lucky than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed towards me for the most part are political.
I admire the professionality and determination of these colleagues when faced with a stream of sexist and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the greatest disappointments in this era's policy is the level of insults that are now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality, we are no longer this broad church and, with every distrust and change of selection rules, the party becomes all narrow.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years about flying under the radar and not being too straightforward, so it's "ordering".
But that is not why I became a politician.
Ever since I joined Labour as a school student 32 years ago, provoked by thatcher’s government’s neglect that literally made my elementary school’s classroom collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it the most – both at local level and as Minister of Government.
I've never hidden my political opinions, and that includes the latest election.
No one in Nottingham East can in any way have been confused by my opinions on policies and topics where I disagree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to those of you who promoted the application on Friday that when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services, I do not understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour's party leader.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency – both Labour members and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of dismissal or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Olagna Ayr on top
Two attempts in the last minute may have distorted the result a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this lovely entertaining Tennent's Premiumship match.
They're now on top, the only unbeatable side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, which gave the home team the prize, and the coach Peter Murchie has all the right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our matches so far and still unbeatable, so we're so, of course, happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card for Scotland's Captain Rory Hughes, who was released by Warriors for the match, let Melrose let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot did an unconverted attempt.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a penalty, and at the end of the first half he scored points and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead of 17-5 in the break.
But Melrose got a good start on the second half of the game and Patrick Anderson's attempts, which were converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
It was then a long wait for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the plan, and after the restart Ayr increased the lead again with a attempt from Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting Captain Blair MacPherson then got a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of intense pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for having tackled Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the penalty-lineout behind Ayr's maul.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent away the flank Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth attempts.
Still Game star seems ready for new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game Star Ford Kiernan seems ready to enter the restaurant industry after it was discovered that he has been appointed CEO of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays along with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duon has announced that the next nineth season will be the last of the series, and Kiern seems to be planning for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the CEO of Asifmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source at Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to get into Glasgow's "flowery restaurant business".
"The garden belongs to us": Coastless Bolivia hopes that the court opens the way to the Pacific again
Seamen patrol a rich headquarters for the La Paz fleet.
Public buildings have a sea blue flag.
Navy bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon's berries motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to recover it."
In coastal Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still strong – and it is also long to sail on the Pacific Ocean again.
This hope is higher than in several decades now that Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on the first October, after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia has the operation, a mood of unity and peace, and clearly awaits the outcome with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decisions of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, in the hope that the Court of The Hague will judge for the benefit of Bolivia's demands that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, must negotiate with Bolivia to allow them to their own outlet to the sea.
The decision of Monday also has great importance for Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president, who is facing a controversial struggle for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is incredible that the Court should judge for the benefit of Bolivia, and that not much would change even if it does.
The UN Court of Justice, based in the Netherlands, does not have the right to assign Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision is announced only six months after the final arguments suggests that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the last four years, it could have been more damaging than promoting Bolivia's chances.
"The question of access to the sea has been cut by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
She argues that Morale's aggressive rhetoric has trained Chile's continued goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, did not consider that the decision of the Court of Justice had been taken exceptionally quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia "a remarkable opportunity to start a new era for relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of differences of mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the issue of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up his right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he said.
"The conclusion is a chance to realize that we must move forward from the past."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament requires trust in the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that the nation will not disarm its nuclear weapons until they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during a Singapore Summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments came when U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of solving the deadlock of nuclear vendiplomatin more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a "desired" to continue to sanction and the US protest against a statement that ending the Korean war will ever tame North Korea.
Washington hesitates to agree to the statement without Pyongyang first initiating significant nuclear disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is really going to get rid of a weaponry that the country probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal latest line huge mains on their way to shops close to you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a range of crunchy, oversized headbands for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which dazzled the stylons of Paris fashion week.
Unbelievably unpractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designers have sent off their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino’s main creation was an exaggerated beige hat with a featherlike wide hat bra that completely took over the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewelry watermelons, a magician hat and even an pineapple – but they are not intended to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre worms, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful worms had sewn-up lips and looked like Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One creature resembled a wet suit with snorkel and dive mask, and another one looked like a melted glass rod.
And if you continue the enormous courage, you're lucky.
Mode experts predict that the huge heights can be on their way to shops near you.
The oversized hats come soon after La Bomba – the straw hat with a bra of 60 cm that has been seen on all from Rihanna to Emily Ratakowski.
The cult mark behind the incredibly unpractical hat that has taken over social media sent out yet another great creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in bathing suit that held in it.
The raffia bag in terracotta, with electric fiafrans and a white leather handle, was excellent in Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris fashion week.
Luke Armitage’s Dissty List said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores next summer – the designer has had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain outstanding academic results, and this continued in 2018 with yet another set of outstanding test results, supported only by individual and collective progress in sport, art, music and other societal engagements.
With up to 30 000 students in Scotland, schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further education, their chosen careers and their role as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement custom curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and requested topics in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, he'll have his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot only rely on English when we create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's test results show that languages are at the top of the list, with a maximum number of recognised results in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received A in the final higher grade.
Data collected from SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students who studied mandarin received an A in Higher Degree, and 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills such as children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as a subject choice is now considered to be as important as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in curriculumry in independent schools and beyond.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 concluded that employers had difficulty, for various reasons, in completing their vacancies, with 17 per cent attributed to a lack of language skills.
With this said, language skills become all the more necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs requiring language skills, these skills become necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of career choices, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries, automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of over 4,000 adults published by YouGov 2013, 75% replied that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that total came up in a two-digit percentage (15%).
That is why it is so important to invest in language education for our children.
Being able to speak several languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance to find meaningful employment in the future.
In Scotland, each school will teach different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach in languages that are considered to be most important for the UK before 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose between in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and get them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In a global economic environment, it is without doubt language that continues to be crucial to the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication ability".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for Scotland's young people.
I'm sure the bee le faire.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Lakersdebut on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting is almost over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James debut for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's first season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he plays has not yet been decided.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Laker's official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week James was asked about his plans for Lakers' preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games in this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia campaign events, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is doing his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five planned events next week, including events in places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Pending a confirmatory vote of its candidate for the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for future interim elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress before the current elections in November.
What time is Trumps West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trumps Wheeling, West Virginia campaign events are scheduled for 19:00, tonight Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trumps West Virginia-rally online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to deal with this week's questioning of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who was excited for charges of his sexual abuse, with an expected delay in the vote from the Senate of up to one week while the FBI's investigation of the case is ongoing.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help the Republicans get some meat on their feet before the November elections.
Thus President Trump said that these five conventions next week are aimed at "engaging volunteers and supporters in the Republicans trying to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible when entering the hectic campaign," said a spokesperson of the Trump campaign who did not want to be named Reuters.
The night's events, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh's media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who's been working on the public opinion polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the President has to come there to try to give him an increase in the public opinion polls," says Simon Haeder, a state scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is struggling to keep hopes alive for Sunday's singles
After three unilateral sessions, the par competitions in Saturday afternoon could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The moment's swinging pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before in the face of competitions like these.
So what momentum is this about now?
"They had a sex point line and now it's four, so we carry it as a little momentum I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he finished the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points in advance with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel they have a little wind in the sail, but they have a lot to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and combed home three points out of four each.
Spieth has been sharp from thee to the green and leads with good example.
The wine crotch peeled even higher when his round continued and he lowered a decisive putt to take the game four all-quares when he and Thomas had lie behind with two after two games.
His put who won them the game of 15 met with a similar wreck, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to victory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cups undisputed story.
The odd but adorable couple of Europe are four from four, and now nothing goes wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a Bowey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided the Boweys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back Nine on Friday morning.
These achievements and the audience's reactions state that they are the players to hit on Sunday and there is no more popular player who could comb home a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
preferably both, at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, the morning lightball hero, along with Alex Noren.
A Bowey and two double on front nine lowered the Spaniards and the Swede into a hole that they never even came close to crawling out.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of the hole.
Fireball and Foursome are so fascinating to see closely because of the interplay between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not advise and how a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a law so far and has taken a significant lead before the last day, but this Foursome Session also showed that the Team United States has a struggle that some, especially on the US side, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage on Ryder Cups last day after coming out of Saturday's quad-ball and Foursomes matched with a 10-6 lead across the United States.
The inspired duon Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over a besieged Tiger Woods and combed home four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who fought to keep the bag as they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that never really started in the morning lightball with 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the Foursome and won two games, but it was not enough for victory.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single matches to keep the bag.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, named "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, is just the second pair to win four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup's history.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in four-ball, they beat an exhausted Woods and American-Rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5 & 4.
Woods, who fought through two games on Saturday, showed a sample of single moments of brilliant, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball and foursome, and hence seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning lightball and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in Foursomes to a 2 & 1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe did not have co-wind all the way, but it was a nice, windy day just south-west of Paris.
Threetime winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They came home with 2 & 1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in quadruple and later returned to beat the Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in Foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history a team has come back from a four-point substation in the single matches, however, Fury's page only needs an undecided result to keep the bag.
Having been the second best for two days, it looks like a counter-attack on Sunday can be difficult to get through.
North Korea says that the "never" will disarm unilaterally without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations last Saturday that continued sanctions deepened their mistrust of the United States and it was not possible that the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation’s annual General Assembly that in the past year, North Korea had taken "important measures to demonstrate its goodwill", for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, demounting nuclear weapons and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and weapons technology.
"But we don't see a corresponding answer from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to an approach divided into stages for the nuclear power that would result in North Korea's reward when it took gradual steps, his statement seemed important, since it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution as Pyongyang previously done.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work towards "the decommissioning of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea has been looking for a formal end to the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first phase out its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected negotiations to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "decommissioning first" and increases the pressure by means of sanctions in order to achieve its purpose through compulsion and even object to the "declaration of the end of the war", says Ri.
"The notion that sanctions can get us on our knees is a wish for those people who have no knowledge of us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the leaders of the United States highlighted in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the party to this issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea and not the United States, the Korean peninsula's nuclear disarmament would not have come to such a death row."
Yet the tone in Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's future ability to reach the United States mainland with rockets was inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "raketman" on a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "continue" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take action for disarmament, but it said that much work remains and that sanctions must remain until the North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months", it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the maintenance of the Security Council sanctions must continue with force and without failing until we realise a complete, final, verified disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to suffocate the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri in connection with the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made. North Korea, however, accused him a few hours later of setting "gangster-like requirements".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile plant and also a nuclear reactor complex if the United States adopted "equivalent measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "equivalent measures" he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and were moving towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has led all doctoral students to improve their sleep habits in an effort to combat the growing macho culture to study through caffeine-filled "deeps".
An academic study found that students at the world's leading university are often a little out of the question of the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first in his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after discussing the impact of sleep shortages on learning.
"At the end of that, a girl came up to me and said, "Why can't I know this until now, during my last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep--which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was organized for the first time this year, explains to the students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and CEO of University Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that the students suffered from serious sleep shortages during the week.
The hour-long course includes a range of interactive tasks.
In part of the course there is a picture of a student room, where the students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to find out about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleep shortages and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behaviour of the students directly.
But we believe that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "deep" still exists, he says and added that modern technology and ever increasing pressure on the students meant that sleep shortages were a growing problem.
To ensure that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapons" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain because insomnia puts the brain in starvation and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old californier who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course and has read one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course was an eye opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study programme before they start their studies at the high-performance institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students consider setting an alarm for when to lie down and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" issued by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can cause you to turn around in the daytime, leading to business problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengas targets lower Gerrd's men
Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Menga's strike sent Steven Gerrd's uneven side to a 1-0 defeat team in Livingston.
The Ibrox page was looking to take home its first win on the road since February 4-1-triumf on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his team eight points after Ladbrokes Premiership leader Harts.
Menga hit seven minutes before mid-term and Rangers never managed to level the results.
While Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is just behind Hibernian on the mark.
And there may be more problems on the lute of Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a main year after an object was thrown from the far end.
Gerrd made eight changes to the semifinal of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point of Hearts last week and he would have been happy about the way his well-killed game was overwhelming the opponents every time.
Rangers must have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
It should have been goal already two minutes into the match when Menga first pass released through Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle fielder missed his great chance and shot outside.
A deep-friction park from Keaghan Jacobs then reached the team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the rear post.
Rangers took control of the game, but it seemed to be more hope than faith in their games during the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelo probably felt that he should have been punished when he and Steven Lawless were colliding, but Judge Steven Thomson waving away the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers only managed to make two goals in the first half but the former Ibrox goalie Liam Kelly easily received Lassana Coulibaly's nick and a domestic kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Livis opening shots for the 34th minute may have gone against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their kneeling deserved it.
Again, Rangers failed to handle Jacob's permanent situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher went to Scott Robinson, who kept calm and chose Menga for a simple ending.
Gerrd acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the switch gave almost immediate effect when the outside struck the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block the attempt.
But Livingston continued to get the opponents to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett that swept up long pass after long pass.
Holt's side could have strengthened his leadership at the last stage, but McGregor managed to prevent Jacobs before Lithgow nodded outside the corner.
The Ranger Glenn Middleton had another late demand for punishment when he was tamped with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now one page from Sunday's calendar: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "His" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the manick called Geigermeter.
Geiger meters have become a foundation stone for science since then, and form a major part of pop culture, as well as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with the leading role in the seemingly unlikely cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
MAN "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these headphones you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals. "Evans:
Evans: "Yes, it's popping up now!"
"His" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancer forms and then re-injected.
A trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer, saw her ovarian cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancer forms called HER2 and then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promoting the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and large intestine cancers," explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "learning" them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA cap, after its SNL appearance.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West bowed out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a swaying appearance in which he praised the President of the United States Donald Trump and said that he would be able to himself for the post 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he wore a Make America Great chaps, he spoke against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to a white person, they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a scathing with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee about the charges of sexual abuse made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not sent, the playback of West's exposure was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to drive West with the post.
West had also regretted himself before the audience that he had been harassed backstage for his main residence.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on it."
They bullied me!
And then they say I've fallen low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you also want to sink low?" and said that he would "put my supermancape on, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Test with love."
His comments attracted more burop at least twice from the audience and employees from SNL seemed generated, reported Variety.
West had come in as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with its appearance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the Conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: TAK FOR STANDING YOU THE MOBB."
But the pratshowens host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was simply "being herself and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") that I think embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
So are we, she added.
Before the show announced the rapper on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the creature previously known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Didy.
Rapparkolleg, Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and, of course, the deceased music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was previously known as Prince.
They for attempted murder after knife cutting at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defendant is expected to arrive at Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The allegations will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington beats toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his sword-swandering role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has spoken negatively about the stereotype of the macho hero and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to respect.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes that "Something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his fellow actor at Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, even she 31, admitted that he felt quite strong to deal with the problem.
"I personally feel pretty strong, right now--where have we gone wrong with masculineity?" he said.
"How have we raised men in view of the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that TV can partly be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He went on, "What's born and what's learned?
What is taught on television and on the streets, which makes young boys feel they must be in a certain way to be a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions today - how do we change that?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not make any Game of Thrones followers when the series comes to an end next summer and says that he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
From November Kit will play in a new recording of Sam Shepards True West which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife thanks to the series, so in that way it gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, in which Kits character Jon Snow falls in love with Emmys-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family owners in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, says health authorities.
About 40 000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases were transmitted via sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spread through certain parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected by HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, said the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000 people from year to year.
HIV infection through intercourse is an urgent issue in China's HBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against HBT people is said to be widespread.
Due to its conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men sooner or later will marry women.
Many of the infestations are due to insufficient protection during intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denys that staff leaked the data of the GOP server, blames on "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, American congressman Maxine Waters condemned allegations that one of her employees had posted personal data on three republican American senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles-Democracy argued that these allegations were disseminated by right-wing extremist websites.
"Longs, lies and more deplorable lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The released information contained according to address addresses and phone numbers to the Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing about the charges of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the sources of posts was associated with Water's office and released the information about a member of Water's staff, reported Hill.
"This unfounded statement is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false claims - were in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unfounded statement is completely false and an absolute lie."
Water's statement quickly got criticism online, including from White Houset's former press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests that she does not have the temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone's being accused of something they didn't do, they can't be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the motives of the questioner.
They must be calm and sensibly."
Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water's reaction with the democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of having seemed angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was able to set aside Waters in the middle of his term of office, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Very true," he tweeted.
In her statement Waters said that her office had warned "appropriate authorities and law enforcement of these fraudulent demands.
"We will see to it that the perpetrators will be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again - powerless spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit terms in every new movie with British tilt, and the same seems to apply to this new recording of the latest Johnny English action comedy - a series of spy parodies kicked off in 2003 with Johnny English and got a new life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will Vass satir tell us how obviously bad we are to become the new export product of the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has received its license to clash to the point for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation intended for the bio-crow even in non-English-speaking countries.
He is of course the crazy secret agent, who, despite his bizarre claims on smoothieglamour, has got a little bit of Clouseau, a gnut Mr. Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the Olympics in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There are one or two nice moments in the latest JE movie
I loved it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the rotor blades a short while hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is displayed, but the sense of humor feels quite low and strangely redundant, especially since the "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels as if it is suitable for children instead of adults and for me Johnny English is strangely busy not as inventive and focused as the Atkinson's dumb film bravares in the role of Bean.
The current issue is now that Britain is in serious problems.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies, which reveals the identities of all UK agents out in the field, to the agent in the service's great dissatisfaction - an extremely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last straw for a Prime Minister who is a pompous and hard-working figure, already suffering from a complete collapse of his political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing his very best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but the script does not offer much to work with.
Her intelligence counsellor informs her that when every single active spy is busy, she must use someone who retired.
And that means the stutter Johnny English in his own high character, now employed as a teacher in some well-known institution, but offering unofficial lessons in the art to work undercover alongside.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with its former long-lived sidekick Bough, once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, a jolly hockey stick-roll where Vicki Pepperdine is near to the scapegoat.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so horribly wrong with Her Majesty's Secret Service and encounters Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister will fall hard on the charismatic tech-millionaire, who claims that he can solve Britain's computer failure: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssé of father-like excitement: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle on board Volta's luxury boat; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta's house.
There is certainly a lot of work behind the latter sequence, but although the film is both charming and busy, it has an air of children's TV around it.
Pretty moderate everything.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can't help thinking, can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies drawing up a plan for the British to work for a four-day week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Party Labour is considering a radical plan that assumes that the British work a four-day week - but are paid for five.
According to the task of the party, business leaders will leave savings made through the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but keeping the same salary.
According to sources, the idea of "passing" with the party's economic agenda for the benefit of the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by trade union Trade Union Congress as a means for workers to take advantage of economic changes.
A representative higher up in Labor said to The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen in one day, but a four-day working week is an effort that fits into the party's attitude to balancing the economy in favour of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, even the Party The Greens who promised a four-day working week during their election campaign in 2017.
However, this objective is not endorsed by Labour as a whole.
A Labour spokesperson said: "A four-day working week is not the policy of the Party and it is nothing that the Party agrees."
Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of "faceless leaders" and "sinners" of state companies.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies cannot get back their entire operation, as a Labour government can do "deduct" because of what they perceive has been incorrect acts.
He also confirmed plans to put employees in corporate boards and create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds where 10 per cent of the private company's equity capital is transferred to its employees, which then stands to receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell the TV program "60 minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their opinions.
The FBI's investigation of allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the investigation by the Agency could cause some Republican Senators to change their position on the matter.
In an interview sent on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley of Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked whether the FBI could reveal anything that would lead to a change of opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went into the hearing, I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that the statement came out, and said, "Have you done this?"
He was determined, convinced, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, seems unbearable.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamite cooking," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it strongly," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all of her names couldn't verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I can't see anything new changes."
What is Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormously impressive exhibition of stars that appear and an equally impressive mission; to combat world poverty.
In its seventh year, Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people wandering to Central Park's Great Law, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event: to fight extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival is, according to a 2012 declaration, an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to combat poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for the event (if you were not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, email a world leader, call or in other meaningful ways help raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it only about so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel that they make a real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen reports that more than 19 million "documents" have been registered from its supporters who have fought for a wide range of goals.
It says that these measures have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The Group estimates that so far the assets collected have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the UK between investors and actors who are engaged in "helping children to develop to their full potential", promising to give Rwanda 35 million dollars to help combat malnutrition in the area after having received more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British Government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can do social injustice as malnutrition is a footnote in history," said the ambassador of the Tracey Ullman Partnership to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also said that after more than 5000 measures were taken that require the UK to improve the diet of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes diet programmes aimed at 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the common questions on its website, "what makes you think we can fight extreme poverty?"
Answered Global Citizen: "It will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who appear at this year's event in New York, the hosts of which are Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use its fleet in a "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports indicating the Minister for Home Affairs
The government can "if necessary" resort its fleet to prevent Russian energy players from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, has the US Minister for Home Affairs Ryan Zinke revealed, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria - especially where it seems at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern parts of Europe," he said.
And according to him, there is a way and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability to ensure, with our fleet, that the shipping routes are kept open and, if necessary, apply blocked, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market", he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants in the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group calling themselves "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they really are the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "daylight" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Statements will, after the Trump administration has had the aim of increasing exports of its liquid natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the far cheaper alternative for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of the Trump Administration, including the President of the United States Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump made Berlin Moscow's "capture".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
They argue that Washington's opposition to the project is driven only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was rejected by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I strongly dislike that a third party is disrupting our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, Head of Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "ordinary thinker" if she is going to stand up in the Presidential election in 2020," says Massachusetts Senator.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a "ordinary thinker" about her participation in the presidential elections after the U.S. Mid-Annual elections.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider setting up as a candidate.
"It's time for women to get to Washington and get our broken government, and it includes a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I'm going to take a real thinker of candidating to the Presidential post."
Warren weighed in on President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting and said he "took this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does for our democracy," she said.
Warren has been outlawed in his criticism of Trump and his candidate to the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
On a tweet Friday, Warren said, "We need of course an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own followers did not believe that she would be able to do so in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "faithful" Massachusetts constituents said that the senator should not be able to do so, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidature.
The survey showed more support for a candidature by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent for a potential candidature and 48 per cent against.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermonts Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after taking possession in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through now when he's back, I can relate to other families who have experience of PTSD and part of the trauma with which our soldiers return," she said to the audience at a meeting of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in space" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back as other people, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and accused of domestic violence against a woman, trying to prevent a report on domestic violence and armed possession in a benute state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Columbia support the questioning of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial trial aimed at a new American policy that denies asylum to victims who flee gang-related violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and district submitted a friendly-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, reported NBC News.
Full name of the applicant in Grace v. Sessions submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the policy has not been revealed.
She said that her partner "and his violent gang member sons," abused her, but American officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries that produce a large number of asylum seekers, as nations that face major problems of gang and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy amended a decision by immigration authorities of 2014 which enabled illegal immigrants to apply for asylum in order to escape from domestic violence.
The District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all applications for asylum to be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances in which the claim is valid and such provision is contrary to that principle", according to the Friend-of-the-court report.
Lawyers further argued in the report that policies that deny the entry of immigrants harm the US economy and argue that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "deliver the necessary labour force".
In June, the Minister of Justice, Jeff Sessions, ordered judges in asylum cases to no longer grant asylum to victims who fled domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asyl is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions when the policy was announced June 11.
Asyl was never meant to alleviate all the problems - including all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu when the death figure doubles in the pursuit of survivors
To the survivors, the situation looked all the more bleak.
"It feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted his shy boy in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"The ambulance picks up dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is a shortage."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes, being rooted by water-damaged possessions and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged in the earthquake at 7.5, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who were hit by a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the hospital Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continued strong post-scalation.
With tears of eyes, he told us that the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't run.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "mobbing" with "propaganda ads"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-sided ad in an American newspaper about the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the American ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The President of the United States Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily paying an addition to Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's best selling newspaper - after prosecuting China to try to participate in the 6th Congress elections of the United States, which China rejects.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in American elections marked what American officials told Reuters where is a new phase in an escalating campaign from Washington intended to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war with elevated tariffs on each other's imports.
China's debt tariffs in the early part of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states such as Iowa, which supports the Trump Republican party, this according to Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador in China and the former long-term governor in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and companies.
China, Branstad wrote in a debate article in the Sunday Des Moines Register, "dimensioning the bullying by placing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"The government of China uses America's dear tradition of freedom of expression and a free press to spread propaganda to by publishing paid advertisements in Des Moines Register", wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, in the newspaper skiing on the street here in Beijing you will find a limited number of different votes and will not see any true reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's troubled economy, because the media is controlled with the iron hand of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most outstanding newspapers nobbed the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which magazine.
Republicans scare off female voters before the mid-year elections by Kavanaugh Fiascot, warn analysts
Since many top republics defend the Supreme Court's nominated Brett Kavanaugh, who stands before several accusations of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a setback, especially from women, during the forthcoming elections.
The feelings about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the elections.
It is not possible to turn back the clock, says Grant Reeher, professor of Political Science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona) last attempt at an FBI investigation will suffice to calm down angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not November", says Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday, according to Washington, DC.
On Friday morning, the demonstrating "November will come!" when they demonstrated in the hall to the Senate building when the Republicans who control the judicial committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democracy enthusiasm and motivation will go on the roof," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, for the news site.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among yet indefinite female voters in suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, although they do not like the President, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony with allegations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a setback could follow if the Republicans pressed through the confirmation.
"This has become a confused issue for GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to the NBC News.
"It's not only about the Committee's vote or the final vote or if Kavanaugh comes through, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Head of Priorities United States, a group that helps democratic election campaigns, for the news channel.
But the Americans in general seem to be divided over who to believe in in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, and the latter seems to be the one they believe the most in.
A new opinion poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying during their testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from the Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations that Ford has made, as well as those of at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported the Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Justice Committee on oath last week that Kavanaugh violently attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez argues that the candidate to the Supreme Court exposed his sex organs to her while attending a party during their time as a student at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a start-up aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology doctor's latest project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons are given access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data large" or a POD.
It may include lists of contacts, to make lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser simultaneously.
What is unique with the personal online data storage is that it is fully up to the user who can access which type of information.
The company calls it "personal authority through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers to work with the project and a group of volunteer coders.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create dedicated decentralised apps using the tools available at the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where all business models are set high over one night.
"We don't ask them for permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has in recent months been an influential vote in the debate on net neutrality.
Also during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about this new era on the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest rewarded with Victoria Cross during World War I celebrate
The only priest in the Church of England who was rewarded with a Victoria cross during World War I is now celebrated in his home town 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for her actions during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had been awarded the British military's most prestigious prize.
A memorial stone was uncovered by his two grandchildren under a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his granddaughters, Michael Vann, said it was "brillantly symbolic", that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's prize was rewarded.
According to London Gazette Lt Col Vann on 29 September 1918 led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "by a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the line of fire and led with "great bravery" the line forward before he alone settled the battle.
Lt Col Vanta was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something that I know I could never live up to, but something I'm very humble in front of."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also put down a wreath after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "became very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "a real hero's courage is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and instead got to see Greta Gris
Imagine this, you have stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 just to be denied to watch the main event.
The show from San Jose contained 13 games, including six on the masterboard and was shown live at night in Great Britain on Channel 5.
At 06:00, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the program suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were little impressed after they had stayed awake until the early morning hours to watch the game.
A fan on Twitter described the program change to a signed children's program as "a sick joke".
"It was the government's decision that the content was not suitable so early in the morning, so they had to switch to children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president for marketing and communication when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Gret pig, yes."
Bellator's CEO Scott Coker said that they will work on their schedule to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we will be able to find a solution with regard to the reprice," said Coker.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the software exchange upset a lot.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was, in fact, a state question.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We will show five games instead of six - as we normally do. We took water over our heads in our efforts to satisfy the fans.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "underly" because of sexuality
The Olympic divers Tom Daley says that feeling inferior to their comrades during their childhood due to their sexuality - but it also encouraged him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize he wasn't like everyone else until he went to high school."
When he spoke in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give others "hop."
He also said that he cared less about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The popular show's regular programmer, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off because of illness.
During his one-off appearance on Laverne's first program, Daley tells me how he felt "less worth" than others during his childhood, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "This feeling of feeling less worth and feeling different has been a real source of power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so that he didn't betray everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-fold Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile advocate of HBT rights and took advantage of its appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to convince more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he took the word because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without restrictions and wanted to give others "hop."
The threefold world champion said that his fall in love with a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "come as a surprise".
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much in such a young age" - he participated in his first OS as a 14-year-old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "life perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was just about winning gold, he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that Dad did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about was if they got their tickets to the Olympic Games in London in 2012 - where he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't say to him: you won't be able to sit on the front row of Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead as I finally admitted he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the Olympics in 2012 and won bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - to dive in front of a home republic on an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song - Proud of Heather Small - a song that had followed him up to the Olympics and still gave him Russians.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of form on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will strike record on Sunday when he plays his 47 Ryder Cup match, but then he has to fix the form to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th consecutive time, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's Fourballs and Foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of events, which he has often been for the United States, the fivefold winner spent his day working cheerball and practicing at his game in hopes of getting a chance to show off his ability.
He has never been the straightest of drivers, not even at the top of his career and the 48-year-old is not in the shape of the toughest course at Le Golf National, where the long ruff often punishes badly.
It is not just the banana that discourages, in the ninth match on Sunday, Mickelson meets the master Francesco Molinari, who, together with the novis Tommy Fleetwood, won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are 4 points below the 12 single games, have a side wind at first, the Mickelson match can be absolutely crucial.
Fury expressed confidence in his player, not because he could say much else.
"He totally understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on his back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"His self-confidence is nothing wrong with.
He is a famous and he has added so much to these teams during previous seasons and during the past week.
I probably didn't think he'd be able to play two games.
I thought he could do more, but now it's as it is, and we'll have to settle for it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson Nick Faldo's record passes for most Ryder Cup matches played.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely lived up to the heights of his individual results.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk said that his presence brought other qualities to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, quick, likes to joke with people and he's a good guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds so much more than just games."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can soon be a memory only
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in the last day's singles in Ryder Cup can quickly change into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team under the leadership of Seven Ballestero held a five-point advantage over the Americans but who finally won with the least margin with the result 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"It reminds you that we led great at Valderrama, we led great on Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with distress and nip," said Bjorn (on the photo) after watching the 2018 class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and lead with 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone in the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we'll give it all.
Go out and do everything right.
This is not over until we see the score on the board.
Our goal is to try to win this pokal and that is where our focus is.
I have said it all the time, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are well aware of what is waiting on the other side - the best players in the world."
Björn was satisfied with his players' performances on a tough golf course and added: "I would never manage this myself.
Tomorrow, new challenges await.
Tomorrow it is the individual achievements that apply and it is a completely different matter.
It's nice to be out with a partner when it's going well, but when you're out there on your own, your capacity as a golfer is fully tested.
It is the message that you need to convey to the players, to get out the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he must go and get out the best of himself."
Unlike Björn, opponent Jim Fury will want the players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who came home three points out of four.
Fury himself has been on both sides of great conversions during the last days of a competition, both in the winning team in Brookline before he ended up losing as a loser when Europe drove "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in reply when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the Captain of 1999, had gathered his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to go out as fast as Brookline, as on Medinah.
When the tempo starts in one direction, there will be a lot of pressure on these intermediate games.
We made our setup and placed the guys we wanted to, you know, create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight and meets Rory McIlroy in the top match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I joined this group of guys in this order because I think it's enough all the way," said Bjorn about her single choices.
Germany’s new warships are delayed
The newest frigate of the German fleet would have been launched in 2014 to replace warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will not be launched until at least next year due to incorrect systems and high costs, reported local media.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Palatinate", the leading ship for the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg Frigatets, has now been postponed up to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper which quotes a military spokesperson.
The vessel should have joined the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery were fatal for the ambitious project.
The four vessels in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen-fregats.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a range of air protection and marine targets missiles, as well as some sneak technicians, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the latest frigates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships - which allow Germany to project power abroad - are already obsolete when they are put into operation, says Die Zeit.
The fateful F125 frigate created headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
A little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media stated a number of important "mjukvaru- og hardware errors" which made the warship useless if it was used on a battle mission.
The lack of software was particularly important because ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older Frigates in the Bremen class.
It also appeared that the vessel has a significant overweight, which leads to a decrease in performance and limits the marine's ability to perform future upgrades.
The 7 000 tonnes heavy "Rheinland-Palatinate" is assumed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during the Second World War.
Apart from incorrect hardware, the entire project's price tag - including training of crew - is also a problem.
It is said to have been fraudting EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - compared to EUR 2.2 billion in the start-up phase.
Problems affecting the latest frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the fleet should actually "get a shortage of fully equipped ships".
The official said that this was a growing problem, since old ships were decommissioned but no replacement vessels were provided.
He regretted that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust twitter lights to the secret life of the bat
New research carried out on a real estate in the Scottish highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help control future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at National Trust for Scotland, will follow South and Dwarf Pipiistrell as well as brown loaned and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special players will be placed at important places around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile examinations using hand-held detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bats and which species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS Environmental Protection Adviser, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for the bat and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest fields for bats and other related species.
The numbers of bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have decreased considerably in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects boning and loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as aircraft and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks from head taxes.
Well, bats aren't actually blind.
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes in catching the prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats seriously.
The organisation has ten trained experts who regularly carry out investigations, examine bon and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Three Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here at Three, we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and a lot of favorable habitats.
But there is a lot about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other property helps us to understand more about what they need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of searching for bats before performing maintenance in real estate, as it is possible that accidental destruction of a single nest could kill up to 400 females and young people, and possibly wipe out an entire population.
The bats are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, trouble or disturb them or destroy their bon.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are."
Ronaldo rejects rape while his lawyers threaten to sue the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape charges against him for "false news" and says that people "will market themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus forwards have been accused of rapeing an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He claimed to have paid her $35,000 to keep quiet about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a Live video on Instagram, Ronaldo (33) disbanded the reports as "false news" when he spoke to his 142 million followers, only hours after the demands were reported.
"No no no no no no.
What they said today was false news," said the five-fold Ballon d'Or-winner to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all right," said the player and smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations they have called "an unauthorised reporting of suspicions of integrity", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "mortal injury to an amount equal to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged event is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he reportedly would have raped her anal, according to documents submitted at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent" a "good guy" the betrayal of the "last percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was with consent.
Mayorga also argues that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed on a conciliation because she felt "fraid of retribution" and was worried that "be humiliated publicly".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to cancel the conciliation because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will forever regret" to lose car manufacturers
Britain "would regret it forever" if one lost its status as a world leader in car production after Brxit, business minister Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "orienting" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement they will temporarily cease production at the factory in Burundi, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event of no agreement being concluded could result in loss of jobs.
The Burnaston factory - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see the production stop in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, toyota's CEO at Burnston.
Other British car manufacturers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its Mini facility in Oxford for one month after Brexit.
The main problems with regard to what car manufacturers say are risks to the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without settlement.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, this could lead to interference at the border, as the industry says, can lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day in stock at its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and therefore production would have to be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequer's plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that will enable, as I say, not only success at present to be appreciated, but for us to take this opportunity." he said to the BBC Radio 4:s programme Today.
"The statements from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supplier chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term it warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalllaris, who has worked in Burnston for 24 years and is the leader of the Unite Association at the factory, said that his members are increasingly worried: "My experience is that these jobs never come back.
A government official said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be "launched in another week" while the fight against the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of the special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian involvement in the elections, relations between Trump and Russia and the president's potential obstacle to justice.
Whether Trump will kick the Deputy Minister of Justice, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington defaults for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying interception equipment to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of setting aside the President via the 25th amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, and reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to kick Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Legal Committee's questioning where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual irregularity, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date for it has not been set, it may happen this week, or a delay of one week, considering all other things happening at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would dispute the statement: Sanders has not held a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
The value Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to anything disliked against TV reporters like "playing for the gallery", even though she said, "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President holds several question sessions than any president before him," she said and added without citing evidence: "We have looked at these figures."
Conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen us do a lot over the last few weeks and it will replace press conferences, and you can then ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly responds to questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, perhaps the president showed why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances to the assembled reporters.
The Minister of Health writes to EU employees at NHS Scotland with regard to the concerns of Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and desire for them to stay behind Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the cost of discontinued status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public sector.
In the letter Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on exit have continued, with regard to decisions expected to come in autumn.
However, the British Government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I value the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Collectors from all over the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit patients and societies we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes surgery after he has suffered head injury
Tennessee State Tiger's Lineback Christion Abercrombie went through an acute operation after having suffered a head injury in Saturday's loss by 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennessee's Mike Organ.
Tennessee States head coach Rod Reed told the reporters that the damage happened just before half an hour.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed," said Reed.
Coach and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on a stretcher was carried out for further evaluation.
An agent from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated at the hospital Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "There is no information about the type/incretion of the damage yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt second year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before he left the game, which gave him a season total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp tax when they purchase a property in the UK
Foreign buyers may pay higher stamp tax when purchasing property in the UK, and the extra money is used to help homeless people, according to the new plans of the Tory Party.
The action will neutralise Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase of the stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The UK Ministry of Finance expects to collect up to GBP 120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when they buy property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help homeless people, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises of housing with more affordable prices and aiming at high income recipients.
The increase of the stamp tax will be taken out by individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money will give a ride to the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee is in addition to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in recreational dwellings and dwellings purchased to rent out. It may be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will attract up to GBP 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by people who live outside the UK. This drives prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to get a foot on the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new play will only come a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the stamp tax to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to refrain from quotas on affordable housing in order to solve Britain's "poor housing situation."
Jeremy Corbyn has launched a visionful enough suggestions for housing reforms, including a rental roof and an end to evictions without the tenant's call.
He also wants to give municipalities more opportunity to build new dwellings.
Theresa May says: "Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, that life should be better for every new generation.
This means solving the problems in the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and also for companies that are based abroad, to buy homes as hard-working residents in our country.
The dream of owning their home has become too many people just a distant dream, and homelessness is still an unworthy fact."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to train Scotland"
The Sunderland leader, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old shots look forward to the challenge of blowing life in the club from north-east England, which is currently located in third place in the League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light last summer after leading St. Mirren back to Scottish Premiery last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a game in the B team and that's all," says Ross to the BBC Scotlands Sportsound.
"But when I grew up, I looked a lot at Scotland on Hampden with my father, and it's always attracted me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage to run a club."
Among Ross representatives for Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he was not worried about following such established names in such a large club. He has previously refused to accept offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Just now I assess success based on the answer to the question 'Can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
This club belongs absolutely to the Premier League, considering its structure and talents," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably just look at myself as a success here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a period as assistant trainer in Dumbarton and a 15-month sejour as a member of Hearts training team.
Then he helped Alloa get back from moving down to the third division, and lifted St. Mirren from being close to moving down to becoming the winner of the championship title the following season.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than ever during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a crossroads," he remembers and refers to when he took command of Alloa.
"I really thought leadership was right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had okay results and I could live well on it. Besides, I had some great successes.
But playing can be tough.
There's a lot you have to get through every week.
There is still stress and pressure at work for me, but training feels right.
I've always wanted to practice and now I do it. I feel better than I've ever done in my entire adult life."

A survey shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 5:30 on a Saturday
The heat well of the summer has increased revenues for the country’s fighting pubs, but the restaurant chains have been under greater pressure.
Numbers showed that pubs and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but restaurants' revenues decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin from CGA, who has compiled the figures, said: "Continued beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in the World Cup longer than expected meant that we saw a similar pattern in July compared with June, when the pubs went up by 2.8%. However, restaurants got even more difficulties.
The reduction in the revenue of restaurants by 1.8% in June only got worse in July.
Pubars and bars offering drinks showed the very best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pubar that offers food also had difficulty in the beautiful weather, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People seem to have just wanted to go out and drink something.
The draft of managed pubs and bars went drinking up by 6.6% that month, and food sales down by 3%."
Paul Newman of the serving and entertainment industry analyst RSM says: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and major sporting events are still the main factors in retail sales in the supermarket.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups still have difficulties, although a 4.8% reduction every year is particularly difficult to deal with in excess of current cost pressures.
The long warm summer could not have come more uncomfortable for companies driven by food sales. Time will have to show if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August give someone well-needed respit."
The total sales increase in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July. This reflects the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
The industry sales supervisor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub bar and restaurant industry in Great Britain collects and analyses information about 47 active groups with a total turnover of over £9 billion, and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One survey shows that one in five children, sometimes as young as 11 years of age, have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20 000 high school students shows an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
The result has increased the concern that sexual content is put up there.
20% of the students stated that they had a "main account" that they showed to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years of age, create social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20 000 high-school and high-school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "Fold Insta accounts", a reference to the Instagram image sharing service.
The result has pointed to the concern that sexual content is being posted there.
20% of the students stated that they have a cleaned "main account" that they can show to their parents, and then they also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled over her 13-year-old daughter's secret side found a teenager who called on others to "bring me."
According to the study, carried out by the organisations Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmisstress Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools, 40% of the children had two profiles between 11 and 18 years of age, and half of them recognized that they had private accounts.
The president of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to create places on the Internet where parents and teachers do not find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "The Voice of the Ideas" on the Board of the Scottish Freedoms Union, Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as an external board member at the Governing Body’s Annual General Meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most praised free-trader, and President Ian Beattie describes the elections as an outstanding opportunity for those who lead sport to benefit from her wide experience at international level in the last decade.
"Eilidh has gained great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that the sports in Scotland would benefit greatly from her becoming a member of the board," said Beattie.
Doyle says: "I would like to be a voice for the athletes and I hope that I can help and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, has a total of four Olympic gold and is now an expert commentator at the BBC. He lost the ability to go after a mini-stroke.
He writes on Twitter: "Today, a month ago, I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time was allowed to tell if I would recover, and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I have recovered completely, learned to go again and now I do mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement."
Ads for chest pumps that compare mothers to cords internet
A company that sells breast pumps has caused differences on the internet with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to cows that get milked.
In order to draw attention to the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent portable chest pump", the consumer engineering company Elvie has released a music video-inspired advertising film with humorous means to show which freedom the new pump gives mothers pumping breast milk.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with cows to a song of text lines like: "Yes, I milk myself, but have no tail" and "If you didn't know that, this isn't a udder, but tits."
The refund continues: "Pump out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the commercial film, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused combat on the internet.
The film has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has encountered mixed reactions from the viewers. Many say it sheds light on the dairy industry's "phases".
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Just as we have to get pregnant and fed to be able to produce milk, but their kids are taken from them only a few days after birth," writes one person.

Another comment: "You understand that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another one adds: "What reality-reverse advertising film."
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is "hysterically funny."
"I think this is brilliant.
I'd have got one if I was still breast-feeding.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial film is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product," writes someone.
Another comment: "This is a fun promotional film that turns to mothers who pumps (often at the workplace or in the toilet) and feels like 'cosors'."
This is not a film that celebrates or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, the women reveal that they've all danced with the discreet pump stuffed in their heads.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no cables or pipes and can be worn discreetly in a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin is a partner and ECD at Mother, and she says: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By pulling a parallel between women pumping breast milk and dairy cows, we wanted to shed light on breast pumping and the challenges with it, while in an amusing and easily recognizable way we show what incredible sense of freedom the new pump gives.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump creates headlines.
During London’s fashion week, a two-child mother appeared on the catwalk with clothes from the designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to a tent camp near the border in Texas.
The number of children deprived of liberty has increased even though the number of people crossing the border every month is relatively unchanged, partly because of the harsh rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Government of Trump has made it more difficult to place the children in reference persons.
In the past, most referees themselves have been paperless immigrants, and save to put their own opportunities to stay in the country at risk by declaring themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult household members would have to provide fingerprints, and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Authority, testified before the Congress that the government had arrested dozens of people who had applied to be referees of unaccompanied minors.
The Authority subsequently confirmed that 70 % of those arrested were not known by law enforcement authorities earlier.
"Almost 80 % of those persons who are either themselves reference persons or family members of reference persons are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to pursue these individuals," said Albence.
In order to deal with children's cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to enter court within one month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, as was previous practice, according to the staff at the premises.
Many of them are present on video link rather than in person to bring their legal action before an immigration judge.
Those who are not deemed to be entitled to protection are deported quickly.
The longer children are deprived of freedom, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to staff at the premises and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Proponents say that concerns are increasing in larger plants such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is more likely to be ignored because of the size of the plant.
They add that if children are moved to the tent town without having enough time to prepare emotionally and say good-bye to friends, the traumas many are already breaking with.
Syria demands that American, French and Turkish "occlusion forces" withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "will be handled accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that "the war against the terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that the Government of Damascus would continue "to fight this sacred battle until we have freed all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1 000 soldiers on the ground in the war-run country.
As far as the refugees are concerned, Moualem said that it is good for them to come home, and accused "some Western countries" of spreading irrational fear that drives refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They police something that should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a fresh agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last large rebel mount Idlib has created an opportunity to proceed with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement interrupted a large-scale attack of Russian-supported Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines", and expressed the hope that a military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaida-connected Nusra Front, who "will be wiped out".
The United Nations Messenger Staffan de Mistura will soon be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of members of the government and members of the opposition, in order to draft a post-war Constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mr Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee and said that the work of the Group would be limited to "review of the articles of the present Constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the re-election of 2020 unless his presidency were ended in the past by national law and scandal, which many liberal viewers are likely to hope for.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic final of a presidency ever!"
At the moment, there is no sign that the viewers have grown tired.
Since 2014, the viewing figures on best transmission time have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and are almost three times as high, 1.6 million, on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at best transmission time, which is an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped the cable channel lists with as many as 3.5 million viewers during big news nights.
"This is like a fire to which people are drawn, because that's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC's drama "Designed Survivor", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed Capitolium.
Nell Scovell is a multi-year comet writer and has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snowking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club". She has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the elections in 2016.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Donald Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,' says Nell Scovell to me.
In chaos there is an entertainment value.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, Washington's reporting can determine the future of the abortion case, Roe vs Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the well-being of the global economy.
Shutting off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one has suddenly sat and looked for six hours on an expert panel discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" to his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's bomb jacket of ostriches for 15 000 dollars ("a garment filled with hybrids", as Washington Post said) and the meaning of Story Daniel's spouse descriptions of Donald Trumps, hm, anatomy.
I will never see Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality series is that he comes with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump companion's rotating role crew and daily entrances (buckle the argument with NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).
If you miss a single episode, you're gonna end up at the postage.
When I spoke to the TV producer Mr. Fleiss this week it was sun and 27 degrees outside of his house in northern Kauai on Hawaii, but he sat and chewed indoors and looked at MSNBC while recording a broadcast from CNN.
He could not get tired, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be faced with the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Court of Justice was in the wake.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs in the past, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss said to me.
"I thought it was some sort of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from currents into the evenest race ever before the middle-year elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th Congress District receives a lot of money. It is thanks to the restructuring of a Congress District that has allowed two members to compete for the same place.
This recently redesigned suburbs in Pittsburg is represented by the democrat Conor Lamb, who got his place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb is campaigning against another member, the Republican Keith Rothfus. He currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which greatly overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were constitutionally changed to the advantage of the Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th district has caused a campaign funding dispute between the largest party economic sections, Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee, (DCCC) and the National Republic of Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a scarce win in a wide-spected special election in March to Pennsylvania’s 18th Congress District.
That place had been held by a republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts had given the Democrats a certain advance.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for China support but then backed up
Diplomates noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already acknowledged Beijing, with a little resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's president Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama, until the partners turned up the Trump organisation's leadership team.
Officials of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs decided to call home the leaders of the American missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "news made the decision to no longer recognise Taiwan", said the Department's spokesman Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions against El Salvador were planned, which received an estimated 140 million dollars in US aid in 2017.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American country hard with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
While internal meetings progressed, American and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
However, in mid-September, high administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which in practice put an end to considering sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now to speak at the conference, which is to take place in the middle of October. It is a sign of the importance of the Presidential administration in the meeting, said the diplomats.
And the three American messengers returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson for John Bolton of the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by the three American officials, two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussions against the promise of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also expressed an anonymous opinion.
Study History
The next inevitable step could be the special investigator Robert Mueller's report on Donald Trump's alleged abuse in legal proceedings, for which there is now substantial evidence in public registers.
Mueller is also reported to direct his investigation against whether Donald Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
If Congress were to change the majority, Trump will be held accountable to that congregation just when he prepares for the election again, and perhaps finally before a citizen’s court.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to say that Trump will inevitably fall, nor his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how lengthy the fight can be.
In 1938 German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had stood against him and stood behind the Czech-lovaks of Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath that followed.
History revolves around such crucial events, and the inconvenient advance of democracy is accelerated either or slowed down.
The Americans are now facing several of these crucial events.
What are we gonna do if Donald Trump gives Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what's going to happen to Mueller's investigation, kicked?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that last year he should have proposed to secretly record the President, and wondered that he would not be suitable for the office.
Rosenstein says The Times report is not correct.
"How shall we respond if the recent requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he is allowed to enter the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, in the interim elections, will we vote for a Congress that holds Donald Trump responsible?
If we fail in these trials, democracy faces a dark period.
But I do not think that we will fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-lovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador residence.
She survived, migrated to the United States and, 60 years later, she sent me away to light the Sabbath lights on the table decorated with the hook cross.
With that as an inheritance, how could I be anything but optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is optimistic before the meeting with Rapid Wien
Rangers receive Rapid Wien on Thursday. They know that victory against the Austrians after the impressive Spain match against Villaarreal that ended adjourned earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making its first appearance for the season, until the 2-2 match against Villaarreal. However, he believes that Rangers can use the result as a sparrow board against major successes.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," says the 31st year old.
"We went into the game in the belief that we could get something, and went from there with a point.
We might have gotten it in at the end, but in general it was probably a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half, and we came back in the second half, and we were better off.
On Thursday, it will be an important night in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it'll be a tough game. They got a good result at their last match, but if we have the audience with us, we can probably roll out and get a good result.
Last year was very tough, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The team is good and the guys have fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put the last season behind us and succeed well."
Women sleep badly because of fear of pension savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear picture of how they wanted to be taken care of, there were few who spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the nationwide study said that they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't step up and talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not talk about how you want it in good time.
Work with your advisor and your family and discuss where and how you want to have care. Your choices may have a major impact on the costs.
Take help from your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choice of long-term care funding may include a traditional long-term care insurance solution, a hybrid life insurance solution with cash value to cover costs, or a self-insurance with own resources, if you can afford it.
Create legal acts: Avoid legal conflicts from the beginning.
Create a medical authority so that you can appoint a trusted person who is looking over your medical care and make sure that the medical staff follow your wishes, if you become unable to communicate.
Consider, too, a mandate for your economy.
You then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in your place and make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who gets into an emergency medical condition and is on your way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please write down the details so that you are ready.
"It's not just the economy that's at stake, but who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What kind of drugs are they?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Be sure to have the plan ready."
Multiple shooting with air rifles in Ilfracombe

The victim, who is 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police describe the shooting, which took place around 02:30, as a "unusual incident".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The damage is not life-threatening, and the police are calling on the Witnesses to listen to them.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday. It reports officials. The death rate is expected to rise.
The communications are out of place, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to obtain information from the Dongila management area, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake. The earthquake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16 000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Dongila, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the main location in the province of Central Sulawesi, and is located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city's population was estimated to be 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami struck.
Dongga is a management area extending over 300 km of the north-west Sulawesi coast.
The administrative area, which is an administrative region under a province, in 2017, had a population estimated at 299 200 people.
The main players in the Central Sulawesi province are fisheries and agriculture, especially the Dongila coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongela have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last hundred years, according to the Indonesia disaster management authority.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongila.
Also in 1996, Western Dongula was struck by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the circus seismic lightning, which is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A great earthquake at the west coast of Indonesian Aceh province on northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries. 226 000 people died along the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit Sumatra's west coast at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale struck south of Java, Indonesia's richest island, and triggered a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 hit near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 hit on one of the Mentawai islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten meters was triggered. Showers of villages were destroyed and around 300 people killed.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya management area in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, when people were reminded of the devastation of the mortal earthquake and tsunami 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: Great earthquakes struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok. More than 500 people died, most on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested accused of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaska governor and vice president candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, who is 29 years old and from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect for domestic violence, for having entered into a home-based notification of domestic violence and for having opposed the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska's state police.
According to the police report, he should have taken the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin is held in custody in Mat-Su and is held against the 500- dollar bail to be paid if the suspect violates the terms of the bail, according to the KTUU television channel.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "guaranteed not guilty" when he was asked to give up his attitude, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected of three cases of less serious crimes according to Class A, which means that he can be imprisoned for up to one year and $250,000 in fines.
He has also been accused of a case of less serious crimes according to Class B, which is punished with one day in prison and 2 000 dollars in fines.
It's not the first time Palin's been accused of crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now handled by Alaska's Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of having committed himself to the notification of domestic violence and of possession of weapons under the influence of that event.
His girlfriend accuses him of hitting her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she had linked her son's violent behavior to posttraumatic stress syndrome, which comes from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia last Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity supply and communications are low, and death rates are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit just outside the central Sulawesi, which is north-east of the capital of Indonesia Jakarta.
Movies that show when it hit the circle now on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding a rare death penalty for suspects of terrorist attacks in New York City.
Federal prosecutors of New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York which killed eight people. It is a rare punishment that has not been executed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, should have used a rental truck from the construction and interior range Home Depot to perform an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway on the lower Manhattan. He beat down pedestrians and cyclists in his way at the attack, which took place in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious body damage, according to the declaration of intent on the death penalty submitted to the Southern District in New York.
Both of the charges can be a death sentence, according to the trial.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged with by a federal jury on 22 points, including eight cases of murder to support protection activities, often used by federal prosecutors in the case of organised crime, as well as the abuse and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "wide planning and intent", the prosecutors said, and at the same time described the way that Saipov carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and inhuman".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferrachi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco injury and loss", says the declaration of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York's southern district has not been indicted in a case where the death penalty is claimed in a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York City in 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced to stamping to spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The pair Rosenberg was both executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who is a citizen of Uzbek, showed, according to the court documents, a lack of regret in the days and months of the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the charges, Saipov told the authorities that he got inspiration for the attack after watching IS movies on his phone.
He also asked to put the IS flag in his hospital room, the police gave up.
He has not declared guilty of the 22 charges.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov. He stated that they are "givenly disappointed" on the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to call for the death penalty instead of going to prison for life without the possibility of conditional release if the defendant admits guilty only prolongs the trauma caused by these events for all those involved," said Patton.
Saipov's team of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
MEPs from Tories say that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest at Torie's conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must "feel the heat" from EU sceptics, when one of Theresa May's own MEPs proposed that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Member Peter Bone said at the march in Birmingham that the UK had already "beginned" if Nigel Farage had been Brexit Minister.
However, the challenge that Theresa May faces as regards the reconciliation of the deeply divided supporters has been exacerbated by EU-positive tory members, who have joined a separate protest against Brxit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers agreement, alive during attacks by Brexitan hangers, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU itself.
Her allies have insisted that she should press and try to get an agreement with Brussels despite the setback, and force Europeans and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "kaos".
Bone said at a mass meeting that had been organized by the  Leave Means Leave organization in Solihull that he wanted to "spoll the Chequers agreement".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and given responsibilities in negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stood by the helm, we would have been out by this team," he said.
Peter Bone, who represents the Wellingborough district of Parliament, added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we must flush the Chequers agreement".
He made clear his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought World Wars to become subjects.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone dismissed the allegations that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British would have changed and now want to stay is completely untrue."
Brexitan hangar Andrea Jenkyns from the Tory Party was also on the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say, 'The Prime Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in the party and in our election workers who are out on the streets and make sure we are elected.
Put away the Chequers and start listening."
And she added a sharp message to Theresa May: "Primary ministers may keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that politicians must "feel the heat" if they would betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, 'We're not gonna let you get away with it.'"
In front of the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to get our political class, which is close to betray Brexit, to feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud UK."
At the same time, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the central city.
A group of activists waved with tracks with the text "Tory members against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
The Labour Parliamentarys Lord Adonis of the Upper House mocked the conservatives for the security problems they encountered with a party app when the conference opened.
"It is these people who say they can have IT systems in place and all technology for Canada plus plus plus agreement, for frictionless borders and free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"It's a pure father's.
There's no good Brexit," he added.
Warren is planning a "ordinary thinker" to run for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to get a "ordinary thinker of candidating to the Presidential post" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Democrats from Massachusetts talked about their future during a city house meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticised President Donald Trump, and is now putting up for re-election in November against the Republican State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was Deputy Chairman of Donald Trump's campaign in Massachusetts 2016.
She has been the subject of speculation that she might take on Donald Trump 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th City Hall meeting with the voters since Donald Trump joined.
A person asked her if she was planning on running for president.
Warren replied it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government.
A person arrested for the death of the basketball player Sims from LSU
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the death shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 a.m. for ET.
They had released a film from the shooting on Friday to help identify a man who is seen on the pictures.
20-year-old Sims was shot to death near Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and finally died of this," the chief police officer Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via the news site 247 sport.
Wayde went between to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he had been on the scene and had a weapon, and he admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any incidents and brought to the custody of the police in East Baton Rouge.
Sims was junior player, 198 cm long and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, and cut in 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after team orders gave him a profit over Sebastian Vetel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton on the tower when he defended his position during the first two yards, and invited Vetel to attack his teammate.
Vetel went in the end first and let Hamilton drive in at the back of the cluster, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went in a row later and came out behind Vetel, but Hamilton went forward after a little wheel-to-wheel-action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free with the risk of offering in place after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in the rear row and lay seven at the end of the first yard on his 21st day.
He then led a large part of the race and held the tires to reach a fast finish and drive around Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
Finally, he arrived at the 44th shipyard, but he was unable to speed up during the remaining eight yards when Raikkonen went up to fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me go.
The team has done an exceptional job and got a one and a two," said Hamilton.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday, for maintaining that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, nominated judge of the Supreme Court, is accused of sexual abuse.
The president, who spoke at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly raise the testimony from Ford before the Senate Justice Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "elaka, nasty and lying."
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the past few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry, mean, nasty and lying," he said.
"You see press releases and leaks and they say, 'No, I haven't.
I haven't done that.'
Remember?
Did you leak, Diane Feinstein?
Remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked it.'
Wait a minute.
"If we've leaked, no, we haven't leaked anything," he added, and imitated the senator.
The letter with details of Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have come from her office.
"I have not darkened Ford's accusations, I have not leaked her story," said Feinstein to the Committee according to The Hill newspaper.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she wished."
But her dementi doesn't seem to have fit the president, who during Saturday evening's meeting commented on it like this: "I'll tell you one thing. That was really bad body language.
She may not have, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continues to support the candidate to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual crimes by three women, and he suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power with all necessary means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," said the president according to the digital news site Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars served Friday's loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Belfast Giants received an early two-way lead through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie signed off for the team before Dwyer restored Belfast Giant's leadership.
Francois Bouchard acknowledged to Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season of Adam Keefe's team, which came from behind and struck Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season for the two teams, and Belfast Giants had won the three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave assist when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the intense first period, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie who signed at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Belfast Giants was in the lead at the first break when he made his second target for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard even once with a target in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, and he secured the win with his team's fifth half-way through the end period.
Belfast Giants, who has now lost four of her five latest matches, will play at home against Milton Keynes at their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died so that hundreds of people on a plane could escape an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is now hailed as a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane of hundreds of people on board could lift safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a large earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are stuck in the rush of the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild-sowing control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could lift safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it would break.
He later died in a hospital.
The speaker of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian TV channel ABC News.
"We arranged with a helicopter from the Balikpapan on Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We are moved to hear this," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the death rate can rise to more than a thousand people. The country’s disaster relief authority says that there is limited access to the cities of Dongila, Sigi and Boutong.
"Death figures are believed to continue to increase because there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been reached", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the authority.
Up to six - foot - high waves have ruined Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in help and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: "Each minute comes an ambulance with dead bodies.
I don't think there's much clean water.
The mini markets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to meet by there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
Indonesia was affected earlier this year by earthquakes at Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man is missing after an aircraft crashed in a lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed in a micronesia law in the Pacific Ocean now states that a man is missing. Previously it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated from the sinking plane and were in safety.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try and find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped to save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed in the water when it tried to land at the airport of the Chuuk Islands.
Officials stated on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and what the course of events looked like.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane slipped past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane flew in very low.
"It's extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to wade through waist - deep water to the emergency exits of the sinking planet.
He said that the cabin crew panicked and screamed, and he had a minor skull injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who worked nearby developing a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to drive people ashore before the plane sank into the 30 meters deep water.
Data from Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea for the last two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analysts draw up a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution ended his lecture in the second trial against a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as expert witnesses in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used mobile phone lists to kiss together the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber's movements on the night she died.
Rowlett said that he had received location information from several cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicts his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber’s cell phone for the time he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked me if Tellis told me the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he was "ljuger, for my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis a time after Chambers' death deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He swept her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hiphop?
A hiphop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that hip-hop has come far from its origins in political messages and to tackle social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hiphop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently gained a boost in Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
A black one again?!
A baby girl in New York is right a couple because of dismissal after a "racist" text message
A baby girl in New York is right for discriminatory dismissal after she received a wrongly sent text message from the mother, who complained that she was "a black again".
The couple deny that they would be racist and compare the mood with "expression".
The two-child mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed horror when she understood that the new baby girl Giselle Maurice was black, when she arrived at her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEJ NOT A VART IGEN", Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in an SMS to his husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "loving to mod" and gave Maurice the kick, and claimed that their former baby girl, who was African, had done a bad job and that instead she expected a Filipino woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice got paid for a day's work and was sent home in a taxi.
Now she's right for compensation for the dismissal. She wants compensation in the 350 bucks per day for the job she was employed from the start to do, which would be for six months and where she would live with the couple. However, she had no contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that," she said to the New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple dissuade the allegations that they would be racist and say that the only thing to do was finish Giselle Maurice's employment, and they were worried that they wouldn't be able to trust her when they insulted her.
"My wife had sent her something that she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We're not racists," said the husband Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it were by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously."
Plasco compared the mood with "expression" and said that his wife would give birth to children two months later and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Do you want to get on such a person?
It is not very nice done", added the investment banker Plasco.
The legal process is still ongoing, but public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticized them for their behaviour and reasoning.
The Paddington publishers did not think that the readers could relate to a talking bear, revealing a new letter.
Paddington author Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was adopted, commented on the letter as follows: "It's hard to imagine what it was like for a person who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny, considering what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She told me that her father, who had worked as a cameraman at the BBC before he got inspiration from a little toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the first edition was "bitterful" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family", and added that her father was proud of his final success.
"He was quite quiet by himself, and no bragging person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds with something. You'll be proud of the child even if you're not the one who made it.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little bit like that.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he would always give Paddington his own glory."
My daughter was going to die, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been taken on the road to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors were working in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that it was not expected that she would make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that said she would die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my darling.
I'll come to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The drugs that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly ebbed out and left her body.
She had died just before, and now everything went out.
I just had to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I couldn't push or scream or cry, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get together."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers, who were completely unconscious about the difficult trial she was undergoing.
"No one knew about it," she said.
"I bowed my head down, and my tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt an overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sucking women set up postcards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost relatives because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up maps on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that you can call for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to have to feel as bad as I do every day," she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney. She tells me that her son was a promising cook who had a contagious smile.
"Everybody knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smile lit up the room."
But he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, was the one who found his sibling when he had killed himself in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I'm worried about the consequences all the time."
Sharon Davis created the cards "for people to know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit quiet, talk about it."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost his partner for 15 years, Mark, some time after his mother's death.
"He had not said that he felt depressed or depressed or something," she says.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed that he acted differently.
On Christmas Day, he was at the bottom, and when the children opened his Christmas presents, he had no eye contact with them or anything."
She says that his death was a very hard blow for them, but they have to get through it. "It tears up a wound in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must fight on all."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI initiates investigation
"I thought that if we could achieve something similar to what he asked for - an investigation that is limited in time and scope - we could perhaps have some agreement," said Jeff Flake on Saturday. He added that he feared that the committee would be "split" because of deeply rooted party differences.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican followers want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their reluctance depends entirely on the time.
The interim elections will take place only in five weeks, on 6 November. If the Republicans make a bad choice, which is expected, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to have the man they want elected as the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called Senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was a personal secretary to George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and confirm his election in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean shoppers "sunker" under Kim
The number of North Koreans jumping off to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, which quotes data from the South Korea Reunion Ministry, says that 1 127 people jumped off last year, compared to 2,706 years 2011.
Park says that tougher border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher charges to human smugglers are important reasons.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korea drop-offs are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30 000 North Koreans will have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the furthest border with North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Korean States.
China sees the dropouts as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back with violence.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war with each other, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met for talks focusing on the fast-run negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between USA President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work for the Korean peninsula to be free of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of the lack of success since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances we can absolutely not disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Ri at a speech in the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", and says that he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court of Justice.
The minority leader in the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was temperately unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosis comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like that, she would be called 'hysterical'," said Pelosi of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the charges of having sacrificed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotionally touched, and from time to time he screamed almost and the voice staggered when he spoke of his family and years in high school.
He also expressly condemned the Democrats in the Committee, and said that the accusations against him were a "grotesque and coordinated character murder" organised by liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton losing Presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that she felt that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because it showed that he is partial to the disadvantages of democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way in which he attacked the people of Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi doubted when she was asked if she would try to put Kavanaugh before the national court if he was elected, and if the Democrats get a majority at the representative house.
"I can say this – if he doesn't tell Congress or FBI, he's not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also working in the court he's at now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. appeal court.
Pelosi added that she, as a democrat, was concerned about what decisions Kavanaugh might take against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade abortion case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Mr Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether to amend certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not the time for a hysterical and party person to sit in court and expect us all to applaud," said Pelosi.
Women must stand out.
It is a righteous criticism, months and years of anger that boils over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Ms. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual.
And she continued: "I was helped by a woman who was CEO somewhere. She said that she also cried when she was angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she was angry and began to cry she said to the person she spoke to: 'You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry.
And then she went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to get out of anger partly because they are often misunderstood in the ground.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs in a man-dominated office, where I once cried of indescribable anger, was that I was taken in the collar by an older woman. It was a chilly boss that I had always been a little afraid of, and she pulled me into a stairwell.
"Let them never see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and they're glad they managed to push you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election campaigns.
1987, when Hart was caught with an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and pulled out of the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder thought there was no reason not to investigate the idea of himself setting up in the presidential elections.
"It was not a well thought out decision," she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Because she was late, she was behind with the money collection, and promised not to go in as a candidate if she didn't get two million dollars.
It was a project judged to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave 1 000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in a speech that she would not start a formal presidential election campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotion, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect money and target herself against voters rather than delegates, and angering against sexism, that the vote broke.
"You could have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schröder remembers the reaction of the press.
"You could've thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, 'What are they going to write on my gravestone?'
She cried?
Why the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The opening stage of the US-China trade war was deafening. The war is far from over, but the gap between countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by covering important Chinese export products such as solar panels, steel and aluminium with customs duties.
The most important escalation came this week, with new customs duties on goods for 200 billion dollars, which in practice means that half of all goods entering the United States from China are subject to customs duties.
Beijing has every time answered with the same coin. Recently, fees of between five and ten percent were dropped on US goods for $60 billion.
China has promised to match the US measures. The world’s second largest economy is probably not going to step down within the foreseeable time.
To get Washington to back up means to bow to demands, but to publicly crawl for the United States would be far too generous for China's President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its short-term role, the press from the US Trade War can give positive support to China in the long-term, by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
"A fast political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions for economic panic in either country, and it is actually much more dangerous than the viewers have previously wanted to admit," says Abigail Grace, research assistant focusing on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria "redo" for returnees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that the country is ready to receive voluntary return refugees and appeals for help to build the country, which lies in ruins after the more than seven-year war.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are now improving.
"The situation in place today is more stable and safe, thanks to our success in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build up the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists, to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and perseverance.
The UN estimates that more than 5,5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian aid.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that it did not receive conditional support or assistance from countries that have supported the rebellion.
Europe resigned with victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was able to fight hard during the majority of the tournament, ended up in the water at the edge of the 16th Hole's par 3 course, and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari gleamed in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever made 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth struck out 5 & 4 of the European team's lowest rated players, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest rated player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have made his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, who is a veteran with eight Ryder Cups behind him, became the tournament's most successful European ever with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win back the victory.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said a touched Garcia after the European team's victory.
He handed over the stick to his compatriot John Ram who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in single on Sunday.
"What incredible pride, to beat Tiger Woods. I am raised to look at him, said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France, and now has the result 13-21-3 for his career in Ryder cup.
A strange statistics for one of the world's best players ever, who has won 14 majestic titles, which has only been exceeded by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA fought the weekend to find Fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
The American captain Jim Furyk said after the team's downfall performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
It was time for us this morning to raise the temperature in Europe.
We took the fight.
Hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with America's PGA tour and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
You get to bow and bow.
They played better than we did."
