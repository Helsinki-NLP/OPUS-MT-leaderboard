Politicians in Wales afraid of "like fools"
Some members of the Welsh National Assembly were dismayed at proposing that their title be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It has arisen because of plans to change the name of the Assembly to Welsh Parliament.
AMs from the entire political spectrum are concerned that the change of names could give rise to ridicule.
A Labour member said his group was worried because "it rhymes at Twp and Pwp".
To readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means silly, and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Cymru Party said that the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group was "open" to the change in name, but noted that there is only a short verbal leap from MWP to Muppet (fjols).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire-English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently bringing together a legislative proposal to introduce the changes in names, said: "The final decision on the names that Members of Parliament will receive is, of course, up to the Members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Walisian National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals, where there was broad support for calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
With regard to the title of AMs, the Commission preferred the Welsh Members or WMPs, but MWP was given the greatest support in a public consultation.
AMs seem to propose alternative options, but the fight to reach agreement can prove difficult for the President of the House, Elin Jones, who is expected to put together a legislative proposal on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform proposal contains other changes in the way the Assembly is working, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs get the final vote on what to call them when the bill is debated.
Members of the House shall vote on the amendment of the name of the country.
The voters vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to "The Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote will be held in an attempt to resolve a decade-long conflict with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted on the name of its northern neighbour as a requirement in the territory of Greece and has long protested against Macedonia's attempts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the vote and says he will reject the vote.
The supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of names is merely a price paid to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's get quiet while the churches in Harlem fight
"The older people I've spoken to said that there was a bar and a church on every corner in the old days," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there are none of the parts."
He said it's understandable that the bars disappear.
"People socialize in other ways nowadays," he said.
"Bars no longer make up the neighborhood's living rooms where people enter on a daily basis."
In relation to churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from selling assets will not last long and that they are "before or later back where they started".
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes that are full of such people who do not help the neighborhood's recurring sanctuary.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he says, "and it breathes further to the development where these churches finally close because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original Methodist Assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had worked nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who was at the head of a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who would not hire or promote black.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to restore the building, they ordered the clock game.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor in St Martin's, proudly called the bell game "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played at the watch game in June called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first clock game in the world that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger bell game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's didn't find a substitute for him.
What has played out in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated tale of architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom have been captured by church leaders, others of the diocese.
In July, the Council of the Assembly — the principal body of the sower, which consists of leading laymen — wrote to the bishopship of concern that the bishopship would try to push the expenses forward to the congregation council, even though the Council of the congregation had not been involved in recruiting the architects and entrants sent in by the bishopship.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishopship.
Shark damage 13-year-old diving for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday, as he dived for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, says officials.
The attack happened just before 7:00 near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then with a group paddling over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says that he thought it was just enthusiasm to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy cried out, "I was bitten!
I got bit!"
"All his crayfish was torn up," Hammel said, when he came to the boy, he saw.
"I cried that everyone should get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reported in critical condition.
It's not known what kind of shark that attacked.
The lifeguard Larry Giles said by a media briefing that there had been a shark in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage to his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the route from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons and to perform investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to occupy the beauty market in Britain
Sainsbury's takes up the competition with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with rows of beauty products with special assistants in style with large magazines.
As part of a great effort to occupy the UK beauty market, which has a value of GBP 2.8 billion and continues to grow, while fashion and housing products fall. The larger ranges of beauty products are tested in 11 shops around the country and launched in several shops next year if they prove to be a success.
The investment in beauty products takes place as supermarkets search for new items for shelves previously used for television, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's says they double their selection of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, introduced for the first time.
The existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with branded areas in the style of those you see in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunchs the range of Boutique make-up so that the majority of products are suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly required by younger shoppers.
In addition, the perfume store Fragrance Shop runs into two Sainsbury's shops. The first one opened in Croydon in the south of London last week, and the second one opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a development towards buying small amounts of food daily at local buyers means that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury's, has said that stores are going to look like store stores, as the supermarket chain takes up the fight with the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing several services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales outlets into hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales outlets since they bought both chains two years ago. These operations have strengthened their sales of food and have made the purchases more profitable.
Supermarket's earlier attempts to update beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint action with Boots in the early 00's, but the cooperation ended with a fight about how the earnings from the pharmaceuticals in the supermarkets were to be distributed.
The new strategy comes, after Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy chain with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, 125 GBP three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional range of luxury skin care fires such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's business director, said: "We have changed the appearance and interior design of our ranges of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to give advice.
Our selection of brands is designed to suit all needs and the intrusive environment and the practical location means that we are now a convincing destination that challenges the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones "rare", after Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to GBP 11 million
Dragons' The star Peter Jones left "racial", after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to GBP 11 million with his lifestyle fire to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time for their home products and accessories fires Truly.
The company had been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrows Goop brand.
This Morning sword, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she is leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den-star Peter Jones furious, after she withdraws from their lucrative lifestyle fire at the last minute – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "fast", when the popular TV woman during a tense Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, said that her new agreements – with a value of up to GBP 1.5 million – meant that she no longer had enough time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop brand and was tickled to double Willoughby's estimated property of GBP 11 million.
Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she left Truly while Jones flew out of Britain to one of her holiday homes.
One source said: "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project that she should be dealing with over the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe in what happened Tuesday, but it was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the headquarters of Marlow, which is already ready for sale."
Experts estimate that the exit from This Morning sword, which is among the UK stars with the highest earnings, can cost the company several million because of large investments in products – everything from powders to candles to clothing and housing products – and the potential for further delays in launch.
And it can also be the end of a long friendship.
Mother of three Willoughby and master Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as Chairman of the Board in March.
The two pairs join together on holiday, and Jones owns 40 % of the shares in the Baldwin TV production company.
Willoughby must be M&S Fire Ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin who is hosted at ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business."
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
He made fun of the criticism he would receive from the news media to make a comment that is "not a president worthy" and to be so positive to the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his parody of a news host.
"I gave up nothing."
He noted that Kim is interested in one more meeting, after Trump proclaimed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been suspended.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "similar reaction" from the United States in relation to North Korea's initial action against disarmament.
He noted that instead, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure going.
Mr Trump adopted a more optimistic view in the speech at his vote.
"The North Korea's doing really well," he said.
"There was an uproar to war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his attempt to improve the relationship with Kim had produced positive results – the completion of rocket tests, the release of hostages and the return of terrestrial remains from American military men.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
"It's so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this densely packed arena, we would have about 200 people standing there," said Trump and pointed to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake are killing hundreds of people.
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, non-governmental organisations, for example, were informed that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombox remained without home, no state of national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for calling for international emergency aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has been clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so it is a little challenging," said Sumbung.
While the Save the Children put together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesperson of the national disaster response, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the emergency response.
Because of the earthquakes to which Indonesia is constantly exposed, the country has been poorly prepared for natural disasters.
There are tsunami resorts built in Aceh, but they are not a common view of other coastlines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but apparently a tsunami is missing, and it has probably affected the death rate.
Even under the best conditions it is challenging to travel between Indonesia's many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's inadequate infrastructure a central point in his election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and train routes.
However, Mr Joko's administration has been plagued by the lack of funding in the course of the election campaign next year.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken on a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with mathets, bow and arrow and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge settles at the last moment towards Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League to Chelsea with a score in the 89 minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a return from Xherdan Shaqiri small 30 meters from Chelsea's target while his team was back with 1-0.
He dotsd to the ball with his left foot before making a high shot at the distant pole.
The ball flew high over the field towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just about getting in the position of getting the ball. Players like Shaq are always trying to get as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante came, and I made a single touch, and I didn't think so much about it and I just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 at the half leg, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea attacker handed his heel back to Mateo Kovacic before he set the speed up on the midway and sprinted into the Liverpool runway half.
Kovacic made a quick one-two on the midway.
He then made a long delivery that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defense and finished against the remote pole with a shot with left foot past Liverpool Alisson Becker.

Chelsea plays against Videoton in UEFA Europa Leaguge at 15 Thursday in London.
Deaths from tsunami in Indonesia rise to 832
The death rate from Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832 reports the country’s disaster preparedness early on Sunday.
Many people were reported caught in the rubble from buildings that fell down after the earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the richer scale. It hit Friday and created up to 6 meters high waves, the spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a man of 32 under suspicion of murder after a woman's dagger to death.
A murder investigation has started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street.
The police have called on people in the area who saw or heard something about coming forward.
Police Officer Brian O'Hagan said: "We are in the early stages of the investigation, but I would urge everyone who stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and then or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I would also like to call on all, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with the Dashcam, to contact us, as they may have information that can be essential to the investigation."
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the woman whose bodies were found is from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon are friends who believe to know the woman, arrived at the place to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police state that they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but is told by the police that no one can enter the building.
He was paralysed when he heard what had happened.
The residents are now told that there are several hours to go before they can get back in.
A police officer was interrogated to tell a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman arrives.
She keeps repeating, "It's so terrible."
At 2:00 a.m., there were two police cars inside the fence and another car just outside.
A number of officers were inside the fence and were monitoring the apartment complex.

Parliament's statue of Cromwell will be the latest memorial to debate on "rewriting history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical, puritanic followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "madness" and an "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace at Westminster would become a goal.
The scene during the British Civil Wars was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's amazing image of Cromwell is a testimony to 19th-century attitudes and part of the histogram of a figure that many still believe is worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate mapping is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is certainly is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure that represents one side of the struggle.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and reminiscent."
Killergris assaults and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in South West China according to local media reports.
The man who was only identified under his last name "Yuan" was found dead with an exaggerated artery and wrapped in blood near a pig path on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farm is preparing to give pigs injections of vaccines at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the Qinghai province of China.
He had supposedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pig path next door was open.
He said that there was a big snake in the pig path with blood in his mouth.
A forensic study confirmed that the 250 kg pig had bitten the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and wounded," said the cousin, who goes under the last name "Wu", in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings from security cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it attacking others while the police collect evidence at the crime scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and authorities from the market negotiate compensation for his death.
It belongs to the rares, but there are previously recorded cases where pigs have attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier a pig of 295 kg must have a Welsh farmer against his tractor, until his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba CBC News said that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
"They're just playwright.
They're napping, they're very curious... they're not trying to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect," he said.
The rest of Hurricane Rosa is expected to give heavy rain in large parts of the south-west United States
As foretold, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it moves over the cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rains with floods in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had won 38 m/s, a category 1 hurricane, at 10 Sunday (Danish time) and found 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north Sunday.
At the same time, there is a low pressure outlet across the Pacific, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California Monday as a tropical storm, it starts pushing tropical moisture north into the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm of rain in parts of Mexico Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture interacts with the low pressure outlet that comes closer and creates heavy rain in the south-west US in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storm floods, floating falls and possibly landslides in the desert.
The tropical moisture will create rain up to 51 to 76 mm of rain per hour locally, especially in parts of the southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm of rain is expected in parts of the south-west of the United States, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There is a great likelihood of storm floods with rapidly worsening conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move into the desert on foot when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can transform the canyons into dazzling rivers and thunder will create powerful local winds and create dust blast.
The approaching low pressure outlet will provide heavy rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total rainfall of more than 13 mm, which can give less liquid precipitation and smooth roads.
This would be the region's first rainfall in their rainy season.
Spred tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October there may be great temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic becomes more cool, but there remains a reasonable amount of hot in the tropics.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences through the central United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
During the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the Central and Eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the north-east areas.
There may be up to 26 degrees in New York City Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long climate outlook indicates that there is a high probability of temperatures above average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million then the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million then Thursday's provocative testimony from the nominated court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that was reportedly taking place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle with stations continued, which interrupted the general programmes to tell us about Friday's late development: an agreement composed by Senator from Arizona Jeff Flake, who allowed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh in the drunk state grunted at her and tried to take her clothes off to a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he's 100% sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million sows Friday.
The company recorded average number of viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediately available viewers from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems measuring how many people see programs at offices.
To put it in perspective, it is a viewertal equivalent to a match under the NFL playoffs or Oscar distribution.
Fox News Channel, whose meaning-borne hosts have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing, which lasted all day, said Nielsen.
ABC was second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught for open CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, while demonstrators shouted at him when he tried to take an elevator to the hearing of the judicial committee.
He stood with his face down for several minutes while he was being scolded, and CNN sent live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Mr Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at the hearing of the committee.
All television stations covered live hours later, when the judicial committee was to vote on whether the nomination of Kavanaugh should proceed to a vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said that he would only vote in favour of the belief that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominated person in the following week, which the Democrats, who are in the middle of the Senate, had asked for.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a series of senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election had an influence because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
The UK Prime Minister accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brxit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU in order to "play politics" with Britain's future and undermine national interests.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside the one with Theresa May on the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson presented her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that the UK and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was 'all through ridiculous'.
Shooting at Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson suspected to be behind the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect for the shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Duteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of accidental manslaughter, said the police in Baton Rouge.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the battle.
The police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA, reported the CBS subsidiary, WAFB.
After the questioning of Simpson, the police said that he had confessed to the shooting at Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, reports the lawyer.
The forensic doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish issued an interim report on Friday saying that the cause of death was a wound from a gun shot that went from head to neck.
The police department says that a task force from Louisiana State Police, state police, police from Southern University and citizens in the area has assisted with the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports leader at LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police in the area for their "indiscretion and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Friday morning the basketball coach at LSU, Will Wade said that the team is "knuste" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
"That's the kind of thing you're always afraid of," said Wade.
Vulkan spits ash over Mexico City
Ash spewed from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern neighbourhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Emergency Prevention Centre warned on Saturday Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity occurred in the crater, and 183 gas and ash spills were recorded within 24 hours.
The center watched the rumble and shaking over several rounds.
Social media images showed thin layers of ash on car windows in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have noticed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometres south-east of the capital, since an earthquake that measured 7.1 on the richer scale, shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
The police coincide with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after demonstrators who want independence, came together with unbridled officers, as several thousands participated in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on liberation.
A group of masked separatists held down unrulys, threw with and powder painting and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There was also a fight later in the day when the police used their wands to keep the fights down.
For several hours, independence groups cried out "Nothing forgotten, nothing forgiven" and were met with unionist demonstrators who shouted "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries that occurred during the protests, reported the local press.
The situation remains high in the independent region one year after the vote on 1 October, which was declared illegal from Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters voted overwhelmingly for independence, but the electoral agreement was low, and those who were opposed to the break-up, largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote during violent clashes at voting places across the region.
Independence groups had camped night to Friday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration was held but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer dares to hope that Catalonia can achieve independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy having been given the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they received a narrow but important victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum, and many of their best-known leaders have either moved into exile or sit in dennation, awaiting judgment for their role in holding the vote and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the protests on his phone in support of the police and said that the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"There's getting bigger and bigger tensions," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders, who has awaited his trial since last year, announced that he would stand up for the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"The position as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to reject the decline in the democratic values and the suppression we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested, after house hit by car
Three men of 33, 34, and 39 are arrested after a car several times bumped into a Londonderry house.
The event happened in Ballynagard Crescent Thursday around 7:30 BST.
Detective Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow against the car may also be fired at some point.
Shots from Menga give Livingston victory of 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory
The performances of Livingston were overcrowded by Rangers and gave Steven Gerrd his only second defeat after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's shot made the difference when Gary Holt's team moved up side by side with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team has not won out in the league this season and will meet the leading team Hearts, which they are located eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before then, Rangers are being visited by Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
Livingston, in turn, extends its unspoiled strip to six battles, and Chief Trainer Holt has still not had a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances of cash withdrawals
Holt's team should have been ahead a long time before they scored, and their direct playing style created major problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but delivered across the front of the goal, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the target, after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's cross-cutting header in front of the goal.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could give the stand problems in deathball situations.
And it was under the circumstances that the important goal came.
Rangers made the frispark, and Livingston exploited an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created together the layout for Menga, which made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
At that time, Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but struggled to get through the defense of the home team, and goalman Liam Kelly was largely not challenged.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was turned off with the feet of Rangers goalman Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame in another of Livingston's deathball situations.
There were ongoing surrenders into Livingston's field, but were averted, and two demands for a criminal park – after Halkett's tackle on the replacement Glenn Middleton and one by hand on the ball – were rejected.
"Societal" from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Facial efforts and strong results for Livingston.
Everyone played fantastically and exceeds the expectations of their upward journey.
Their playing style and their squad are largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but a large part of the honor must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he entered.
There were many heroes.
The captain of the Halket was amazing and conducted a well-organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worralll on the toes throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
They have at times been really good under Gerrd, but they played under the level.
Their endings lacked sharpness – only once they were exposed to the home team – and it is a great awakening for Rangers, located in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in the cold
There was smile and blue sky Saturday (29 September), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
There has been disagreement over areas such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's approximation to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to the Cologne to open a new, great mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police were responsible for security reasons, a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but a lot of supporters appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – also noted and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to accept in the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest seen as a hero of some German Turks and mocked as an autocrat of others.
Accidents on the way in Deptford: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist is dead in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred close to the crossing between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwest of town around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and there were rescues on site, but the man died on site.
The accident occurs a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car whose driver fled from the spot, on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said police officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road barriers have been set up, bus routes have been changed and motorists are encouraged to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six officers injured during unrest
Six prison officers are injured in a high-security prison, according to the Prison Office.
There was unrest in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9.30 BST Sunday, and the unrest is still ongoing.
Specialised "Torendo" officers have been picked up to handle the riots involving eight inmates and operating in one wing of the prison.
Officers were treated for minor on-site facial injuries.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison staff are in place to deal with the ongoing unrest of HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are resolved that those responsible are notified to the police and may end up spending longer time behind bars."
The HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison inspector was treated in the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, alarming officers were called to prison to deal with serious disturbances in which employees were attacked by billiards.
The Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm floods (major areas can take advantage)
It is rare for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona, but it is most likely at the beginning of next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert landscape of the south-west United States and create a risk of storm floods.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings about storm floods for Monday and Tuesday in Western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones had preserved the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km of the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm of rain with isolated volumes up to 152 mm in Mogolon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west desert landscape including central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin will probably get 25 to 51 mm with the possibility of 102 mm locally.
For those outside the risk of a storm flood, Rosa's rain can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will be useful because the south-west United States is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category", reports Weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is expected to land on the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning with maximum wind power of 38 m/s and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north by 19 km/h.
The storm meets cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore falls in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with tropical current on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over parts of Mexico can become severe and give a high risk of flooding.
"A total rainfall of 76 to 152 mm is expected from Baja California to the north-west Sonora with a possibility of up to 254 mm", reportedweather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border with Arizona early in the morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into the southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The primary expected danger from Rosa or its remains is very heavy rain in Baja California, the north-west Sonora and the Southwest desert area of the United States", reported the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to create a life-threatening storm flood and a liquid fall into deserts and landslides in mountain terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teen boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4 BST Saturday.
He was brought to the hospital where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man was arrested during the night in the Radstock area, says the police in Avon and Somerset.
Officers have asked everyone who may have mobile recordings of the events to come forward.
Trump says that Kavanaugh was the victim of the democratic party's "badness and anger"
"A vote on Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and monstrous tactics of the democratic party," said Trump at a election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been subjected to the "badness, anger" of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave a testimony in front of the Congress Thursday and strongly denied and emotional accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that he committed himself sexually to her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also made a statement at the hearing about his allegations.
The president said Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and fashion" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote on the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote confirming one of the most talented legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a fantastic past in public service," he said to a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh, while he spoke of the importance of Republicans meeting in the voting places at the mid-term elections.
"In five weeks, one of the most important choices is in our lifetime.
You can't vote for me, but you're actually voting for me," he said.
"That's why I travel around and fight for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "stripe against and block".
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a person high in the Republican party has told CNN.
Centuries killed by Indonesian earthquakes and tsunami, death numbers grow
At least 384 were killed, and many of them were washed away by huge waves that hit the beach when a large earthquake and a large tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said Saturday.
Several hundred people were gathered to a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves hit the coast at dusk time, sucked many in death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami arose after an earthquake that measured 7.5 on the richer scale.
"When tsunamitruslen emerged yesterday, people were still running on activities on the beach. They did not run immediately and became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster preparedness GDPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, the towed cars, wooden trunks, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said and added that the tsunami had moved through the open sea by 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
He said several survivors by climbing up trees to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The disaster preparedness has published aerial photography that shows many broken buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a musket that was surrounded by water.
Retirement continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The root of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesia Technology Review and Application Board (BPPT) said in an announcement that the energy triggered during Friday's major earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that was thrown over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and it may have made the tsunami larger, said the board.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found glued under the rubble from collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been injured and that 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho said that the death rate and damage could be greater along the 300 km long coastline north of Palu, the Dongela area, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication "was totally paralysed without information" from Dongga, Nugroho said.
"There live more than 300,000 here," said Red Cross in an announcement and added that their employees and volunteers are on their way towards the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," they said.
The Board of Directors was criticized on Saturday from many fronts not to state that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said that the waves had come within the time period during which the alert was issued.
In amateur recordings shared by social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building who desperately shouts warnings about the tsuami coming closer to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the inclusions immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that cut off the communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue effort.
The military has begun to send cargo aircraft with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, reporting authorities, but there is still a strong need for food and basic necessities among the evacuated.
The city airport has been reopened, but only for auxiliary work, and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centres in Palu Sunday.
The death rate after Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision's employees from Donggala have come safely to Palu city, where employees seek shelter under tarnishings, which are set in the courtyard by their account. They came past areas with extensive destructions on the road, said Dosaba.
"They told me that there were so many broken houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when aid organisations began the harsh work of rewinding the relief work, complaints came that foreign relief workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Indonesian legislation requires financial aid, supplies and workers from abroad only if the area in which the accident occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of Indonesian red cross.
"When the government says 'OK, it's a national disaster, we can open up for international assistance, but there's no status yet."
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family held to the missing people firm in the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that brighten the dark tales of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders to Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others caught at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandomi, were among his students.
"As a veteran in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told me how in the hours, after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles, desperately had sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu who were part of the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, resulted in only one grey fly leg instead of two blues.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he says.
Twenty takes USD 26,750 to fill up the cash machine in Newport on the Living
The thief stole Friday morning 26,750 USD from a Brink's staff who was fulfilling a cash machine in Newport on the Living, according to a press release from the police in Newport.
The driver of the car had emptied the cash machine in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran "up behind Brink's staff" and stole a bag money that should have been delivered.
Witnesses saw more suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not state how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on the identity of the thieves, please contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes name to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote, "The creature previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had the name Ye for a while and used the name as the title of its eighth album, which was published in June.
The change takes place prior to his performance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces songs Ariana Grande at the show, who canceled for "sensory reasons," said the show's creator.
The name is an abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year, where he discussed his album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one to just Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has switched between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he reported that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former collaborators, JAY-Z, has also switched between small and large letters and changed whether or not the dash is included.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use military power against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has never promised to use military power against civilians as the country approaches the 50th year for a bloody return action against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "never would ever use the military to suppress the Mexican people."
Troops shot at a peaceful demonstration on the site on 2 October 1968 and killed up to 300 at a time when left-wing student movements took root in many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly government grants to students and opening several free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of education draw young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in the field, says investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the US government have issued announcements on artificial intelligence. However, the United States still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, however, introduced their plan last year and aims to take the lead in innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030 at the latest.
"It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough within AI," said Lee.
Doubleting the budget could double the chances that the next major achievement in artificial intelligence is achieved in the United States, Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is Managing Director of the Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most outstanding artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on a system of artificial intelligence, which beat the highly ranked American Othello player, and later became head of Microsoft Research and Director of Google's Department in China.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions that were supported by the US Government, such as the Robotics Challenge, held by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when new competition will come, so that the next visionaries can be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain doctorate from the government, says Lee.
"It's not China that grabs the academic leaders, it's the big companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years hired star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhDs in artificial intelligence should have offered work permits automatically.
The Chinese Prime Minister sent their Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a way similar to the National Science Foundation and other state organisations’ distribution of money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established a joint centre of artificial intelligence to involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the foundation of Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests over USD 100 million a year in research into artificial intelligence.
However, American legislation, which is trying to create a national security commission for artificial intelligence, has been standing still for several months.
Members of the House shall vote on the amendment of the name of the country.
On Sunday, the Macedonian people voted on whether their country's name should be changed to "The Republic of North Macedonia", an initiative that would resolve a decade old conflict with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's attempts to achieve membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province named Macedonia and maintains that the name of their neighbouring country towards the north is a requirement in Greek territory and has therefore used their veto when Macedonia has sought entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the primary Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not take part in the vote, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether or not the number of voters will be the 50% required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the vote was, "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Fans of the change in names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price worth paying to create access to associations such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that arose as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means more secure life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will comply with the outcome of the vote and will do so.
The change of name would require a majority in Parliament of two thirds.
The State Election Commission said there were no irregularities reported at 3:00 p.m.
However, the participation rate was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a elector in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko took part in the vote in Macedonia on a change of the country's name, which would open up to membership of NATO and the EU, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and pulled up chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the vote.
"We are for NATO and the European Union, but we will achieve membership with a raised forehead, not by the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn towards others such as China and Russia and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would provide a much needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that a large majority will vote for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after giving his vote.
He said that a 'yes' result would be a 'security of our future'.
A poll published last Monday by the Political Research Institute of Macedonia indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would vote – less than the required election.
Another poll made by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Out of these, 70 percent said they would vote 'yes'.
In order for the vote to be valid, the vote must be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss to the pro-victory government since its accession in May last year.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero fights through the whole Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton defense in Manchester Citys 2-0-Sjor Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his scorring that came after 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a handout on the midway at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran by three Brighton defenders quickly before he went off on the open track.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He fought past one defender, and then ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a handover to the left and found Sterling.
The English Forward used its first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, which used its right boot to list Brighton target man Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero struggles with some troubles with his feet," told the City manager Pep Guardiola reporters.
"We talked about him playing about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the immediate head start in the Premier League game.
That target came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received in that sequence the ball deep inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice delivery along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of contacts before he led Sterling towards the remote pole.
The Sky Blues front hit the ball in the net just before it slid past target.
City fights against Hoffenheim in the group game in the Champions League at 12:55 a.m. on Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will tease Rockies
Nationals are eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to take on the castu on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still an opportunity to participate in playoffs for Rockies, which has played a game more than Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies held at least stuck in a wild-card slot with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals Friday night, but still have their first division title to benefit.
"Even if we have nothing to play for, we can go to the fight knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audience here in Denver, and that the opponents would play at the probably highest level I will face this year.
Why shouldn't I be excited to play under those conditions?"
Nationals have not yet announced the start line for Sunday, but will probably put Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the spot for 34th time, trained his throws Tuesday and would pitch on Sunday, which is normally his day of rest.
The right-hand player from Washington is 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings during this season.
Trump holds election meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation of his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while he spoke of the importance of Republicans meeting in the voting places at the mid-term elections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
It's one of the big, big – you can't vote for me, but you're actually voting for me. That's why I travel around and fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you can see that happening right now.
And they are determined to get the power back with all available means. You can see how cruel, how repulsive they are.
They don't care who they're hurting who they're going to run into in order to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, but we don't want to give them."
The Democrats, he said, have as mission "striped against and block".
"And you've seen it over the last four days," he said, and called the democrats "afraid and evil and repulsive and lying."
He referred to the chief democratic senator of the Senate's judicial committee, Diane Feinstein by name, which triggered loudly the arch of the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, wait a minute – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a spacious party.
They are intolerant of those expressing their views
When Momentum’s activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was not really a surprise.
I am just the most recent in a number of Labour MEPs who have been told that we are not welcome – just because we have made our point.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she took a strong stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship was about to criticize me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, in Europe, ironically similar problems that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders in.
In the call for the meeting in Nottingham East Labour Friday, it stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as local Members of Parliament, Friday evenings have just been like this.
Today, the tone of many meetings is unfortunately not that way, and the promise of "better, gentler" policy lies far behind in the past if it ever got started.
It has become more and more clear that divergent views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are based on whether the party's leadership can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader when colleagues, whom I thought previously, I shared the political position, began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions that I would otherwise never agree with – whether it was about national security or the European Union's internal market.
When I say my opinion in the public – and it really doesn't matter what I say – I follow a long strip of rough messages on the social media that calls for the disqualification and contradiction of the middle-seeking policy and tell me that I shouldn't be a member of Labour.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments that are being made against me are, as a rule, political.
I have deep respect for professionalism and the willingness to fight against those colleagues who are being imbued with sexism or racism every day, but still fight on.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how normal abuses have become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should create a tolerant culture.
But in reality, it is no longer a spacious organization and, with each motion of censure or amendment of selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
I've been given plenty of advice over the last two years that if I lay low on myself and I'm not so loud, then I'm gonna have to "something".
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I became a member of Labour 32 years ago when I was in school, I was provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, who had left our classroom in a state of decline, and I set out to create better public services for those who need it most – whether it has been as a council member or minister of the government.
I have never hidden my policy, nor in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have in any way been confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the motion for a resolution on Friday, I would say that when the country comes down to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour's leader.
But one message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the local voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of opt-out or political suitability will keep me from acting from what I believe to be your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unveiled Ayr becomes top team
Two late scoors may have got the final result to draw a not quite true image, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory of this fantastic entertaining match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard and are the only unspoken team of ten.
In the end, it was just as much their superior defense as their better exploitation of chance, which brought home the home team, and coach Peter Murchie had absolutely the right to be satisfied.
"Our struggles have been demanding so far, and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Respect to Ayr, they used their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's scoring after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr in front, but a yellow card to the Scottish national team player Rory Hughes, who was awarded for the fight of Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a scoring that was not followed up by a kick.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a criminal park just before the half-leg. He scored and then got a solo coring, so there stood 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose began well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's score, which was followed up by a kick from Baggot, reduced the score difference to five.
There was then a long interruption because Ruaridh Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was carried out out of the track on the stretcher. When the game was resumed, Ayr expanded the lead with a score from Stafford McDonald and a follow-up kick from Climo.
Funging Ayr-annotate Blair Macherson then got a yellow card, and again Melrose took advantage of their extra husband with a scorring from Bruce Colvine without following kick after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came again, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson could after a line-out score behind the emerging Ayr cluster.
Climo followed up with a kick inside the poles and followed up with a more almost right after, the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent a flutor Gregor Henry to the home track's fifth scorching.
Still Game star looking for new career in the restoration industry
Still Game Star Ford Kieran seems to take the step to the restoration industry after it came to light that he has taken over the directorship line of an authorised restaurant business.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main person in association with his collaborator Greg Hemphil.
The duo has announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiern is planning a life after Craiglong.
According to official records, he's the Director of the Asfmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on history, but a source suggested to Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"The sea is ours": the land state of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Seamen patrol around the Navy headquarters, encased in the riggings, in La Paz.
In public buildings there is a sea blue flag.
Navy bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are overpainted with the motto: "The sea is ours, it's a right.
It's a duty to take it back."
In the whole of the land state of Bolivia, the memory of a coast that was lost to Chile in a bloody conflict about resources in the 19th century is still strong, and the same is the urge to sail on the Pacific again.
The hopes may be at their highest for several decades, while Bolivia awaits a judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of ratification.
"Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and, of course, awaits a positive look at the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country and hope that the Court of Justice in The Hague will agree that Chile is obliged – after decades of discussion – to negotiate to give Bolivia sovereignty over an area with access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president, who is facing a controversial election campaign next year, also has a lot at stake in the judgment of Monday.
"We're close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court will take the party of Bolivia – and that there would not be any major changes if it did.
The United Nations Assembly, which has its seat in the Netherlands, does not have the power to dispose of Chilean territory and has stated that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice gives judgment only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have given way back.
"The story of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership," said Zárate.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has destroyed the remaining Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was abnormally rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile, and a chance to end an era of 139 years with disagreements and benefits for both parties, he said.
Mr Calzadilla also denied that Mr Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never abandon the right of access to the Pacific", he added.
"The ruling is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not occur unless they can rely on the United States of America.
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says that his nation will never disarm their nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington first.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep promises made during a Singapore Summit between rival leaders.
His comments were given in addition to the fact that the U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo appears to be facing a restart of the locked nuclear diplomatic over three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a "desirable dream" to continue sanctions and US opposition to a declaration that ends the Korean war will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is holding back from declaration as long as Pyongyang has not only taken significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and the U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread scepticism as to whether Pyongyang is serious about abolishing an arsenal which the country most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Modesshows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large headwear that you will soon be able to buy in local shops
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne lifted up on the catwalk veil for a collection of remarkable headwear in extra size as part of their SS19 collection. The collection impressed at the Paris Fashion Week.
Very unpractical hats have dominated Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
The most impressive work of Valentino was a lavish with a featherlike wide shadow that covered the heads of the models.
There were also other extra large accessories, including watermelons with jewels and even an pineapple – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had compressed lips that reminded more of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a diving thing with snorkel and mask, and others looked like a melted wafers.
And if you continue the great fashion statements, you're lucky.
Stilspeckers predict that the huge hats could come to shops near you.
The fight hats arrive in the heels of La Bomba, the straw hat with a 60 cm wide shadow, which has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratakowski.
The cult mark, behind the most unpractical hatred spread over the social media, has sent a new great creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw that is almost as big as the model that shows it.
The orange basketball with bass frogs and a white leather handle was the most eye-catching in the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in ordinary shops next summer. The designer has had such a big influence that it will be hard to ignore the demand for accessories in huge size."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have many great academic achievements behind them, and it is still in 2018 with a number of unique exam results, which are even strengthened by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other efforts in the local environment.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their students and parents.
The independent schools are trying to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can combine and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we experience that modern languages remain a popular topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it hits his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, he'll hit his heart."
It is an important reminder that we cannot just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can look at the latest results of the examinations this year, that languages are the highest in statistics with the most passed exams in the independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages got the high grade A.
The data collected by SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 per cent of students got the character A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French, and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important competences, which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now seen as a subject choice at the same level as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
A study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that among the reasons why employers were unable to fill job vacancies, 17 % had no language skills to do.
Therefore, language skills become increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
More job opportunities will in the future require language skills, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career the young people choose, they, if they have learned another language, have a great advantage in the future with a life-long skill like this.
The possibility of communicating directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a head start to competitors.
According to a YouGov measurement of over 4,000 people questioned in the UK in 2013, 75 per cent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multiple-digit percentage, 15 per cent.
Therefore, it is important to invest in language education to those who are children today.
When you can speak more languages, especially languages from developing countries, you give children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, schools differ in the languages in which they are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others teach in languages that are expected to be most important to the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to delivering a learning environment that prepares children and provides them with the skills required to succeed, regardless of what the future offers.
At this stage, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be really important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and it must be reflected in the training.
Modern languages should actually be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this award to Scotland's youth.
I'm sure the bee le faire.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron gets debut for Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost over for fans who will see LeBron James play his first fight for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James plays the opening game on Sunday before the start of the season against Denver Noggets in San Diego.
But it's not yet fixed how many minutes he's playing.
"It will be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James most likely won't play the entire game.
After the training earlier this week James was asked about his plans in relation to Lakers' planned six games before the start of the season.
"Where I'm in my career, I don't have to fight before the start of the season to get ready," he said.
Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a stripe election meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five scheduled election meetings next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on the confirmation of Mr Trump's appointed judge for the seat at the Supreme Court is suspended, Mr Trump is trying to provide support for the forthcoming mid-term elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
When is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trumps election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be held at midnight (Danish time) the night between Saturday 29 November and Sunday 30 November 2018.
You can see the Trumps election meeting in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely talk about this week's hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, which has been nominated as Supreme Court. The hearings were tense because of charges of sexual abuse, and the expected vote in the Senate on confirmation has been suspended for a week while the FBI investigates the charges.
However, the primary objective of this summit is to create momentum for Republicans facing a difficult election in November.
People from President Trump's campaign team said that next week's five election meetings are aimed at "making energy among volunteers and supporting when Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the representatives' house", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible, as we enter the busy campaign time," said a spokesperson for the Trump campaign, who would not be quoted by name, to Reuters.
The evening's election meeting is held in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month, Trump has visited West Virginia, the state, he won with over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican candidate to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the President has to step up to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, who deals with state science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown fighting spirit and tries to keep hope alive before Sunday's single dolls
After three one-sided rounds, maybe Saturday's quadrupler was what Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum factor is a fully invented sports concept, but a concept that players believe in – not least in competitions like this one.
Where would they say that there is momentum now?
"They brought six points, and now it's four, so we'll probably see that a little bit as a momentum," Jordan Spieth said before he held the lighthouse.
Of course, Europe has the advantage: they are 4 points ahead, and there are 12 points more to play about.
As Spieth says, however, the Americans feel that they have suffered wind in the sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both can boast with three points of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The loud cheers became higher as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important cushion, which ensured victory in duel four, although he and Thomas had been two blows behind after two duels.
His cushion, which secured them the battle of Hol 15, was met with a similar scream – the kind of scream that shows that he does not believe that the American team is out of competition yet.
"You just need to find the inner strength and focus on your own fight," said Spieth.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, without a doubt the biggest story from Ryder Cup.
Europe's remarkable, but sympathetic couples have four points in four battles and appear to be flawless.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't get a Bowey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Bogiey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way energy appears to flow both to and from the wild audience shows that it is them that it will be most difficult to hit Sunday. And it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory were to be captured by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
They're all synchronously on each of their holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process against Sergio Garcia, the morning in the four-man dolls when he formed couples with Alex Noren.
A bookey and two double bookseys on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they were never near getting out of.
Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The struggles with four balls and two teams a two players are so fascinating to look at closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and the way the strategy of lightning can change.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a significant lead before the last day, but the four-man duels have also shown that the Team United States has the fighting power, which some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe creates performances at 10-6 ahead of last day in Ryder Cup
Europe has a great advantage before the last day at Ryder Cup, after they came out of Saturday's Fourballs and Foursomes with a lead across the United States of 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the road with two victories over a troublesome Tiger Woods and have so far got four points on Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, trying to win the pocal they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated over an unprecist American team in the morning's fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The United States gave more resistance to Foursomes, they won four games, but they were still behind.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points on Sunday's 12 single matches if they're going to keep the bag.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant who has won four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who together got the nickname "Molliwood" is after a sensational weekend the only second pair in Ryder Cup's history that has won four points in their first four matches.
They crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then elegantly defeated a discouraged Woods and the American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought through the first two battles on Saturday, had little brilliant glimpses, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well rested in the morning's fourballs and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in Foursomes and got a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – which is number three in the world.
Europe, however, has as much as they want it to have, on a light, windy day south-west of Paris.
Triple Major-winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard-fledged 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later returned and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in Ryder Cup history that a team has fought back after being behind with four points before the singles. However, since Furyks currently has the pod, they only have to achieve a definite result to keep it.
However, having been second best for two days, it seems that they cannot master a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says that they will not degrade unilaterally if there is no trust
North Korea's Foreign Minister told Saturday the UN that continued sanctions reinforce their distrust to the United States and that it will not abandon their nuclear weapons unilaterally under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea had shown "substantial goodwill" in recent years, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, decommissioning an area for nuclear tests and promising not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology further.
"But we haven't seen a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions there is no chance that we ourselves will take the first step and put it unilaterally."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phase-separated" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps. However, his speech seemed important as it did not clearly reject unilateral disarmament, as has otherwise been the case from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint announcement from Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work "atomic disarmament on the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea has requested a formal end to the Korean war, which played out in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon their atomic weapons.
Washington has also shown opposition to bleeding up for harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'atomic disarmament first' and extends the pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose by compulsion and even opposes the 'declaration of the end of war'," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us down is a wish dream among people who don't know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions strengthen our distrust."
Ri did not mention any plans for a summit between Kim and Trump, as the American leader pointed out earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the nuclear disarmament were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so locked up."
Nevertheless, the tone in Ris's speech was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that firing North Korea rockets against the U.S. mainland was inevitable, after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocked man" for suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened in the United Nations with "total destruction" by North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for showing courage in relation to disarmament, but said that there is still much to be done and that sanctions have to remain until North Korea degrades.
Wednesday Trump said that he did not have a schedule for these actions, but said "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council must maintain sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve the total, final, confirmed nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased financial sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons programme.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sideline of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, while North Korea only a few hours later accused him of making "gang-like demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile plant and an atomic complex if the United States took "the corresponding step."
He said that Kim had told him that the "equivalent steps" he demanded were the safety lifts that Trump gave in Singapore, as well as moves towards normalising relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard take the course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all bachelor students more sleep. The purpose of the course is to counteract the growing macho culture where you study all night sustained by large amounts of caffeine.
One researcher has shown that students at the world's best university often do not know the first thing about looking after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has conducted the course, which he believes, is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea to the course after giving a comment on the effects of sleep shortages on learning.
"When the layout was finished, a girl came up to me and said, "Why do I only get this information now that I'm on the candidate?"
"She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is offered for the first time this year, explains how good sleeping habits can improve your academic and sporting performance as well as your overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the university's health care area, says that the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in serious sleep shortage during the week.
The class consists of various interactive exercises, among other things.
In one of the exercises there is a picture of a dormitory where students need to click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to get knowledge of the effects of caffeine and light, and how one's sporting performance is affected by sleep shortages and how important good sleeping habits are.
In another part of the course, participants hear about how long-term sleep shortages increase the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map of campus.
"We know that it will not change the conduct of students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect your health," adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride that is in taking an "allnighter" still exists, he says and adds that modern technology and increased pressure on the students has led to sleep shortages being a growing problem.
The "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue and anxiety is good and adequate sleep, he said – it even counteracts weight gain because sleep shortages make the brain believe that you are starving, why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiar studying chemical and physical biology, last year Professor Czeisler helped organize the course when he took one of his courses at his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and made him work to make it a general course at the whole university.
He hopes that the next one will be that all graduates will be offered a similar course before continuing their education.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to set an alarm so that they know when they are going to bed and when they are going up. This can raise awareness of the harmful effects of the light from electronic screens, which can move at daily rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goals from Menga lowers Gerrd and co.
Rangers suffered another defeat on the street when Dolly Menga's goal meant that Steven Gerrd's incoherent team had to thank for a defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was after their first win on the field since 4-1-trium at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrd the only second defeat in 18 battles as a coach. Thus there are eight points up to Hearts at the first place of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Ranger team could not respond back to.
Rangers are now smoking down to a sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to a third place after Hibernian with only the target score in difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to Rangers, as Line Judge Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head by a thrown object that seemed to come from the runway section.
Gerrd made eight changes in the layout that reached Betfed Cups semifinal by tonting past Ayr.
The Holt, on the other hand, with the same 11, who shaved a point of Hearts' conduct last week, and he would have rejoiced to see his sharp team exhausted the opponents throughout the course.
Rangers had the ball the most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should have scored two minutes in the fight when Menga's first handout sent Scott Pittman towards Allan McGregor's goal, but the mid-way player's attempt ran by.
A free kick in the depths of Keaghan Jacobs found his way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense player Alan Lithgow kicked past the back post.
The Rangers, however, took control, but played more in hope than the ability of the attack game.
Alfredo Morales was at least not satisfied when Judge Steven Thomson submitted to the columbian appeals for a criminal park when he and Steven Lawless collapsed after a quarter of a game.
Rangers had only two shots on target in the first half, but former Rangers-targeting Liam Kelly did not have problems with Lassana Coulibaly's headhead and Ovie Ejaria's domestic shot.
Even though Livis opening in the 34 minutes was something random, it must be said to be deserved for their efforts alone.
Again, Rangers could not handle a deadball situation in depth from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took the time to find Menga, who could easily kick it into target.
In the break, Gerrd Coulibaly replaced Ryan Kent, which almost instantly gave pot when the flutter sent the ball to Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the team to play on their lashes with many long balls up the track from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have expanded the lead in the final part of the fight, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with a safe hand before Lithgow headed next to the goal.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton appealed again for a late punitive park after being dried along with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked here the other way.
Yearbook: The Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now one page from the yearbook "Sunday morning": 30 September, 1882, 136 years ago today – if we TELLER... – was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that would eventually lead to the apparatus known as the geiger counter.
The geiger counter has become a solid part of both science and popular culture, as it could be seen in the film "Bells of Coronado" in 1950, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans had the leading roles as peasant scientists:
Man, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a geiger counter that is used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals makes."
Evans: "Stop it, it's over!"
"His" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have filled 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognise cancer cells during treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory.
They can then "see" the protein that is common to many cancers and where they are injected again.
A test vaccine is promising in patients with a variety of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells, cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from patients and changing them into the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein named HER2, which many cancers have, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "gets several cancers to develop", including breast, egg, lung and intestinal cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, where you take immune cells out of patients and "teacher" them to attack cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West held Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go well.
After an incoherent performance in the Saturday Night Live study, Kanye West was cast off when he praised the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and said that he himself would act as a presidential candidate in 2020.
When he had played the third song of the evening Ghost Town wearing a Make America Great Again cake, he began at a thunderous speech against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
"I talk so often to white people who say, 'Why do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
But if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved from the United States for a long time," he said.
SNL started this evening's show with a shatch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Justice Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's assault charges.
Even though the recordings were not shown, comedian Chris Rock Wests uploaded to the social media.
It is uncertain whether Rock tried to show West by putting the footage up.
West also complained to the public about poor treatment backstage because of its head covering.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hat on.'
They bullied me!
And they said I was sunk deep," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how deeply I'm sunk?" and said that he would put on his Superman coat because it means "You can't decide what to do. Do you want to progress in the world?
Try with love."
The audience bowed at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff seemed to be embarrassingly concerned, Variety says with a comment from a person who was present: "There was a leash in the study."
West had been booked as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, whose girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many by performing with the song in Love It while he was dressed up as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the Conservative Group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: DO NOT GET NOT TO LET THE POUBLE OF THE POUBLE."
Talking show weather Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "as he is, and that's fine."
"But I do NOT choose to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his "art") who embraces and pours out an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And so did we," she added.
Before the show the rapper had announced that he has taken the name change to "entity that is officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and thus follows Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapcollege Snoop Dogg has named Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased musical Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Know as Prince.
Indictment for attempted murder after knife stick at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed with a knife at a restaurant in Eastern Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, says the police.
The defendants are expected to be brought before the Court of Appeal in Belfast on Monday.
The terms are reviewed by the Public Prosecutor.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington is longing for toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for swinging swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval-fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor, who runs for the stereotypical macho hero, says that this kind of TV character means that young men often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
Kit said to the Sunday Times Culture that he believes that something has gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem lies to him "very in mind".
"At the moment it's very much on my mind - where have we gone wrong in town with masculinity?" he said.
"If we look at the current problems, what are we learning young men in their childhood?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characters.
He went on to say, "What is inborn, and what is there for you?
What are the young men learning from television and on the street who make them feel like they're supposed to be men this way?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
For it is obvious that something has gone wrong for the young men."
During the interview, he also admitted that he will not make successors to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and said that he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
Kit contributes from November to a re-recording of Sam Shepards True West, which is the story of a film director and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers it to have met his wife Rose as the best part of the game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so in that way it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kits character, Jon Snow, fall in love with, in the Emmy Award-winding fantasy series.
The couple was married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's country property in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has published a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, says the Health Authority.
In the second quarter of 2018, 40 000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China because of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who get HIV in this way has been reduced to something near zero, says Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
In one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT environment of China.
In 1997, homosexuality was legitimised, but discrimination against LGBT people is supposedly a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry sooner or later with women because of the country's conservative values.
Many infections are caused by a lack of contraception in these circumstances.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicines as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff leaked data on Republican Senators and thundered against "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Member of the Representatives' House Maxine Waters denied this Saturday's allegations that a member of her staff has shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The democracy of Los Angeles claimed that the claims were derived from websites and support from "the extreme right wing".
"Shits, lies, and more terrible lies," wrote Waters in a twitter.
The published information reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of the American Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was put on the web on Thursday by an unknown person at Capitol Hill. It happened during a hearing in the Senate concerning charges for sexual abuse against the Supreme Court-designated Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support pages such as Gateway Pundit of RedState announced that the IP addresses pointed out that the information had been posted by the people of Waters, after which they published information about a member of the Waters staff, The Hill writes.
"This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie," continued Waters.
"Member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations are by no means responsible for this leak of information.
This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie."
Waters' outbounds quickly got criticism online, including from former Press Secretary in the White House Ari Fleischer.
"It's an angry denial," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be Congressman.
If you're accused of something you haven't done, you don't get angry.
You can't be defiant.
You can't question the accuser's motives.
You have to keep the serenity."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to the critics' criticism of Kavanaugh, who was criticized for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to take over Waters' place in the middle-term elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Great, if that's true," he tweeted.
In Waters' official announcement, she says that her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and the legal powers regarding these fraudulent claims."
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are found," she continued. "And that they will be held legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone in my staff."
Review of Johnny English strikes again – underlying spy comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all recent movies with a British ice cover, and it also seems relevant to the latest action-comedy in Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will dry, sarcastic self-satire, as to how great it is with us, become the country's new export option?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and the big eyes have been given his permission to make bridges renewed again. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comic find aimed at places where the biographers don’t speak English.
He is, of course, the tumbled secret agent who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a little Clouseau, a knife tip Mr. Bean and properly clumsed by him, who performed a single tone to the Chariots of the Fire song at the opening ceremony of the Olympics in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the world-wide and international lukewarm that left chaos in his wake, after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television ads.
There are some good moments in this latest shot at the JE tribe.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the propellers sounded against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comedians, but humor feels quite subtly and curiously redundant, especially now that more "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer convincing comedians as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy adventures are not as ingenious and focused as Atkinson's dumb movie thugs in the role of Mr. Bean.
The infinitely current starting point for the film is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An internet shark has infiltrated England's to-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the English agents in the field to the dismay of the responsible agent – a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last chance for a pompous and ready Prime Minister, who already suffers a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the manuscript.
As her security advisers inform her that every active spy has been exposed, she is required to terminate someone's pension.
And of course, it is the clever Johnny English who is now a school inspector at a high school, but who in hiding teaches how to become a secret agent. There are some funny sequences here when English stands for some kind of school of Rock education in spying.
English is rushed back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunited with its hard tried earlier right-hand Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now been married to an overentussical but well-meaning submarine – a role that Vicki Pepperdine was played on.
Thus, the Royal Intelligence Service's extensive emptiness of Batman and Robin is back when they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is stumbled close to being embellished by the charismatic and terrible tech-milliard Jason Volta – the game of Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England's computer problems.
English and Bough start their furiously risky escapades: Concealed as servants, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English creates clean  theok as he tries to use virtual reality-glasses to get acquainted with Volta's house.
All the cannons are fired in the film's closing sequence, but however well-meaning and energetic it is, there is a sense of child television about it.
Pretty mediocre.
And as I couldn't help thinking about the other Johnny English movies: Can the English film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
Labour refuses to fight with four-day working week with unpaid pay to the British
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour is said to consider a radical plan so that the English can be satisfied with a four-day working week, but get paid for five.
The party will allegedly have business leaders use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give employees an extra day off.
This would mean that the employees would have three days' weekend without going to pay.
Sources say that the idea would be consistent with the party's economic aims to draw the country in a more favourable direction for the workers.
Trade Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from an economic change.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party said to The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published by the end of the year."
"It's not going to happen in one day, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits with the party's approach to changing the economy to the benefit of the workers and to the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the election campaign to the parliamentary elections in 2017.
However, the objective is not supported unanimously by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour's shadow finance minister, John McDonnell, used last week's party meeting to record his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell says that he is determined to tear power back from "anonymous directors" and "users" in supply companies.
The shadow finance minister's plans also cast doubt on whether the current shareholders in the water supply companies will get their money back, as a government with Labour in the lead could "recount" them in the light of immoral actions.
He also confirmed plans to have employees in corporate boards and to set up including equity funds, which are to distribute 10 per cent of private companies' equity value to employees who are to receive up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell us 60 Minutes if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their voice.
The FBI investigation on allegations against the judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week, and it raises the question of whether the FBI's find could get the Republican Senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview shown on Sundays, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig something out that could make them change their attitude.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened – after the accusations arrived – and said, "Did you do it?"
He was steeled, definitely and unambiguously."
The voice of Graham, on the other hand, seems to be in stone.
"I have decided with regard to Brett Kavanaugh, and other things would require a very violent accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know Brett denied it strongly", Graham added with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I can't see it had to change anything."
What is Global Citizens Festival, and has it done something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive offer of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end the world’s poverty.
Global Citizen Festival will receive tens of thousands of people on Central Park’s large lawn for the seventh time, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will bring attention to the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international interest organisation that fights to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
To receive a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concerters must perform a number of tasks or "actions". For example, do voluntary work, write to a world leader, make a phone call or another meaningful action that can bring attention to the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been, now that they have 12 years to achieve the goal?
Creates the idea of rewarding people with a free concert real change, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" – i.e. that people feel that they make a difference by signing a signature collection online or making a twitter?
Global Citizen reports that since 2011 they have registered more than 19 million "actions" from their members aimed at different objectives.
They believe that these actions have encouraged world leaders to achieve binding objectives and policies that correspond to more than $37 billion, which by 2030 is expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group listed 390 objectives and actions that had arisen due to their actions, running up to over $10 billion that had already been paid or collected.
The Group estimates that so far these funds have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main objectives is the Power of Nutrition, which has started in England and is a collaboration between investors and professionals. They strive to "help children to live their full potential" and promise 35 million dollars to remedy nutrition problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, other countries' governments and world citizens like you, the social injustice of malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books," said Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also said that the UK government has now promised funds to improve the nutrition of mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 requests online. This project, the Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with advice on nutrition.
In response to one of the site's frequently asked questions that reads: "What makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?",
wrote Global Citizen: "It will be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we will stumble and make mistakes.
But like the civil rights movement and the apartheid movements, we will succeed because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weekd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performances of this year's festival in New York. Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman must be hosts.
The United States can use its fleet to block Russian energy exports, says US Minister of Interior
"If necessary", Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, reveals the US Minister of Interior, Ryan Zinke, to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s interference in Syria – especially where they operate on invitation from the rightful government – is a pretext for expanding the sale of their energy.
"I believe they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he must have said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"The United States, with our fleet, has the opportunity to ensure that there are free passages on the sea roads and, if necessary, we can also block them so that we ensure that their energy does not come to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting held by the Consumer Energy Alliance – a nonprofit organization that considers itself the "vote of the US energy consumer" –.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran and said that they are basically alike.
"The economic opportunities in relation to Iran and Russia are about using and replacing fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come after the Trump administration has aimed at increasing European exports of liquid natural gas to replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
To achieve this, spokesmen of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 management project, which according to Trump has made Berlin the "capture" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion expensive Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current capacity of 110 billion cubic metres, is merely an economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of unequal conditions of competition and is simply due to economic considerations.
"I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose the supplier," said the Russian Minister for Energy, Aleksandr Novak, at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with the US Minister for Energy, Rick Perry, in September.
The position of the Americans is met by criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to interfere outside the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a major problem with a third party getting involved in our energy supplies," said the head of the BDI, Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren “considers strongly” to stand up to the Presidential elections in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator in Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" to stand up to the presidential elections after the mid-term elections, she said on Saturday.
During an office meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering setting up.
"It's time women went to Washington and repaired our political system, and it takes a woman in front," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider putting up the presidential elections."
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump under the City Council and said he "gossed the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does about our democracy," she said.
Warren has been spoken in his criticism of Trump and his highest-ranking Brett Kavanaugh.
On a Tweet Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course, the FBI will have to investigate the matter before the vote."
A poll from Thursday, however, shows that most of Warren's own backland does not believe that she should show up in 2020.
According to an opinion poll from Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not set up.
32% supported the possible candidate.
The opinion poll showed greater support for former Governor Patrick with 38% for and 48% for a possible set-up.
Other highly-profiled democratic candidates, discussed in the context of the Presidential elections in 2020, include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden stated that he announced his final decision in January, writes Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's PTSD at a election meeting for Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through after he gets home, makes me relate to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers are returning to their homes," she told the audience to a Trump-selection meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in space" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and become harder; they go and think about whether there is respect for what their colleagues on land and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, to prevent the notification of domestic violence and to possess a weapon in the drunk state, says Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the police in Wasillas.
18 states and D.C. support opposition to new asylum laws
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new US law that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. presented Friday in Washington a party-independent declaration in support of an asylum seeker who opposes the law, says NBC News.
The applicant's full name in Grace vs. Sessions, which was submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the Federal Law, has not been published.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" had abused her, but US officials refused her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors, who support Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of American asylum seekers stem as countries with far-reaching problems of gangs and violence at home.
The new U.S. asylum legislation refuted a decision by the U.S. Foreign Affairs Board in 2014, allowing undocumented immigrants fleeing from domestic violence to seek asylum.
The district of Columbia's state attorney, Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new law "surrenders from decades of state, federal and international legislation."
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be determined on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle" states the party-independent statement.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law of rejecting immigrants harms the US economy, since it is more likely that they will become self-employed and "provide the necessary labour."
In June, Prime Minister Jeff Sessions took away the right to grant asylum to victims fleeing violence in the home and gang violence.
"Asyl is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political stand", said the Sessions in their announcement of the Law of 11 June.
Asylum has never been meant to solve all the problems – or just all the serious problems – that people throughout the world face every day.
As the death rate doubles, attempts to find survivors in Palu are desperate
For survivors, the situation only got worse.
"It's very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her little fevery boy at a evacuation center in the ruined town of Palu.
"Each minute, the ambulance comes in with dead bodies.
We need clean water."
The inhabitants now returned to their ruined homes to sort in soft possessions and save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, which were also hit by the 7.5 earthquake, were unable to follow.
Some of the injured ones, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and his shoulder, were outside the Palus military hospital, where patients are treated outdoors due to severe post-mortem distress.
He had tears in his eyes when he told how the violent earthquake shook that hotel room on the fifth floor, he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There wasn't time to save ourselves.
I was mashed up against a broken wall, I think," said Haris to Associated Press and added that his family was going to a wedding in town.
"I heard my wife screamed for help, but then there was still.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
American Ambassador accuses China of unfine methods and propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper brought a four-page ad in an American newspaper that hit on drum for the benefits of American-Chinese cooperation, accuses the American ambassador in China Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The American president, Donald Trump, referred Wednesday to China Daily’s paying inauguration in Des Moines Register – Iowa’s best selling newspaper – after prosecuting China to interfere in the 6th November Congress elections. China rejects the accusation.
US officials say to Reuters that Trump's accusation of Chinese interference in the American elections marks a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to announce in order to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in an escalating trade war, where they have on several occasions customs duties on each other's import goods.
China's return duties in the commercial war were to hit exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican party, believes Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador in China, former governor for a number of years in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural food for China, said that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a leader on Sunday's Des Moines Register that China "supplies the use of the unfine methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government is using the proud American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by running a paid ad in Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In the Kiosks here in Beijing, however, a few disagreements will be found, and you will not get a true picture of the Chinese people's various positions on China's worrying economic direction, as the media are under strict control from the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, although he did not say which.
Republicans alienate women before the mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh case, warn analysts
While many top republicans support and defend the highest-right-nominated Brett Kavanaugh against accusations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that they will experience a counter-reaction in the forthcoming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The case has put the feelings in the hog, and most Republicans have already announced that they would like to see the voting process continue.
"This can't be undone," said Grant Reher, Professor of State Science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article Saturday.
Reher said he doubted that the Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona)'s request for an FBI investigation for 11 hours would alleviate angry voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday – they don't forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group of MoveOn, according to The Hill on Friday.
On Friday morning the demonstrators called out during a demonstration in the Senate: "November will come!" when the Republicans, who control the Committee on Legal Affairs, chose to proceed with the nomination of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, says Mic.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach new heights," the independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg told the news media.
People say that it has already reached a high level; that is right.
But it can reach even higher, especially among female swingers in the suburbs and younger voters – 18-29-year-olds – who rarely vote, even though they do not like the President."
Even before Ford's public allegations of the sexual abuse of the Supreme Court nominated, analysts had pointed out that it could give a backlash if the Republicans continued with the nomination.
"It has become a worse root for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the committee's vote or the final result, or whether Kavanaugh is held accountable; it is also about how the Republicans have dealt with this and how they have dealt with her", points Guy Cecil, president of Priorities United States – a group that supports Democrats in being elected – to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to have shared views on who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, where the latter has a little more on their side.
A new opinion poll from YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents believed in Ford's testimony or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35% said that they certainly or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that they believed that Kavanaugh was either probably or certainly lying during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
At the request of the Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations presented by Ford and at least another, says Deborah Ramirez for The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate Legal Committee last week that Kavanaugh fully attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominated her genders at a party when they both studied at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to create a new internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, launches a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The state-of-the-art project of the Technology League is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the plan with Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up business.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology so that people can make their own "personal online data collection" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, two-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data collection is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's managing director, John Bruce, is to gather resources, processes and abilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contracts and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology developers worldwide can make their own decentralised apps by using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook or Google about whether to change everything completely, so all their business models suddenly become redundant."

Bernard Vantaa: The guest of the Victoria Cross from World War I is honored
The Church of England’s only priest who won the Victoria cross by fighting during World War I is celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel and priest Bernard Wann won the order on September 29, 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and was never told that he had won the highest English military order.
Last Saturday a memorial stone was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said that it was "incredible symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's profiting feat.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Water, September 29, 1918, conducted his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from machine gun and artillery."
He later ran to the front line and led his people forward with the "greatest manslaughter" before he alone attacked an artillery and undamaged three cannons.
Colonel Water was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann at 72 said that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother James Vann also laid a wreath for the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vanta said that he "felt very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people emphasizes true heroism."
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but got Gurli Gris instead
Imagine you've stayed up all night to see the stark Bellator 206 and then you won't see the main event.
There were 13 matches on the program from San Jose, including six matches on the main program, and they were shown the night through in England at Channel 5.
At 6 o’clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald got ready to meet each other, the viewers in England were surprised when the transmission changed to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimposed after they had stayed awake until early morning for this particular struggle.
A fan on Twitter described the shift to a child-rearing movie as "a kind of sick joke."
"Pursuant to the legislation, this content was not suitable at 6 in the morning, why they had to change to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior device president when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Grisen Gurli, yes."
Bellator's managing director, Scott Coker, said that they will work to include English viewers in the planning future.
"When thinking about re-dispatching, I think we can make it work," said Coker.
"But it's six Sunday morning over there, and we can't find a solution to it before Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me when I was replaced, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to repair it, we thought it was a technical error.
But that was actually the law.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had "minor" over sexuality
The Olympic divers Tom Daley says that he felt less worth than everyone else in his childhood because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said it didn't happen to him before he came into the larger classes, that "all aren't like me."
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke about homosexual rights to give others hope.
He also said that he went less into winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The usual host of the radio program, which has been running for a long time, Kirsty Young, has taken some months off because of illness.
Daley was a guest in Laverne's first program and said that he felt "less worth" than everyone else in his childhood because "it was not socially accepted to like boys and girls."
He said: "To-day, the feelings of feeling worth reminding and feeling different have been the things that have given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they learned his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze winner has become a highly profiled LGBT champion and used his participation at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for the decriminalisation of homosexuality in several countries.
He said that he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without any negative consequences, and he would give others hope.
The triple world champion said that he had been "excellent" when he fell in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but told me that the age difference had never been a problem.
He said it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar up and downtures when you go through so much at such a young age – he went to his first OL at 14 years of age, and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June, the couple became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his whole perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would all be if I were to win a gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after having diagnosed brain cancer.
Daley told me that his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they had received tickets to London in 2012 – when he wanted to sit on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there at that time.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and it first occurred to me that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the Olympics in 2012 and won bronze.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life – to dive in front of a home audience at the Olympics. There was nothing that could beat that feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration of his first song – Proud of Heather Small – which had meant much during the uproar to the Olympics and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Fuzzy Mickelson on the bench for Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson puts record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in Ryder Cup, but he has to do something about the form if it's not going to be a sad millstone.
Mickelson, who puts a record record of 12 times in the competition, which is settled every 2 years, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk because of Saturday's Fourballs and Foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of events for the United States as usual, the five - times - big winner had to perform cheers and practice at his game in the hope of correcting the faces.
Even at the high point of career, he did not have the most just drive, so the 48-year-old is not a perfect match to the course at Le Golf National, where the long rough often punishes lost shots.
And if the course wasn't a big enough mouthful, Mickelson will have to meet the ninth battle on Sunday with the always precise winner of British Open Francesco Molinari, who has joined the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who start the 12 single fights, start strongly, the Mikkelson fight can be decisive.
Furyk did not express surprising faith in his teammate.
"He understood his role completely today, gave me a flap on his back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a great faith in himself."
He is in the Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams before – and also this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined he was going to play more, but that's how it went, and that's how it was.
He wants to be out there like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson Nick Faldo will record most games played in Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never been able to fully match his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven undecided, although Furyk said that his presence contributes with something indefinable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, white, he likes to stick to people, and he's good at having in the room," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than just the game."
European Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that great conduct can quickly disappear
The European Captain Thomas Bjørn knows by experience that a solid lead before the last day of Ryder Cups single show can quickly become nervous.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point head over the Americans, but was just getting caught up before the finish with a victory of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice lead in Valderrama, we had a nice lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we only just won," says Bear after watching the 2018 team win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday for a total performance of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History tells me and the rest of the team it's not over.
It's got to be full tomorrow.
Go out there and do everything right.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy, and that is where our focus is.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are also aware of what is on the other side – the best golfers in the world."
Satisfied at his players' performances on a hard course, Bear added: "I'm not taking any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow it is the individual achievements that count, and that is something quite different.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it goes well, but when you're out there alone, you're tested on all parameters like golfing.
That's what players have to understand – get the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, because he also has to get the best in himself."
It also looks like the opponent Jim Furyk who hopes for better individual performance than in the partner game with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced contradictions on the last day. First on the Brookline winning team before he lost when Europe made the Miraqlet on Medinah.
"I remember every word," he said when he was asked how the captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 had spoken to his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like a good start, as you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When the momentum has found a direction, it puts great pressure on the middle battles.
We combine our teams in relation to it and put players on the track in the order we feel for. We try to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the relapse and facing Rory McIlroy in the top battle, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it ensures us all the way through," said Bear about his choice of single players.
Germany’s new warship is being postponed again
The German fleet's latest frigate should have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War. However, the Germans must wait at least a year yet due to technical problems and an escalating price, writes local media.
The insertion of the largest ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of fregatter, "Rheinland-Palatinate", is postponed to the first half of 2019 according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a spokesperson from the military.
The ship was supposed to have become part of the fleet in 2014, but after-sales problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, are to replace the ageing frigates from the Bremen class.
About them it is known that they will have a powerful cannon, a wide range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the latest frigates is a minor need for maintenance: It should be possible to have the frigates away from home ports for up to two years.
However, the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which are supposedly going to cause Germany to appear an overseas power factor – will already be obsolete when they are deployed, says Die Zeit.
The failed F125-fregat created headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to use the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Not much was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of crucial "software and hardware errors" which made the warship useless in battle situations.
Software errors were of particular importance because the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class must be managed by a crew of 120 sailors – that is only half that crew of the older Bremen-fregats.
It also turned out that the ship was too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the fleet's potential for future updates.
The 7,000 tons of heavy "Rheinland-Palatinate" are said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during the Second World War.
In addition to hardware errors, the price of the project, which includes the training of the crew, is also by becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached an average of €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), with an initial price of €2.2 billion.
The problems of the latest frigates are becoming even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's fleet power is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Government's Defence Committee, earlier this year admitted that the fleet "is running out of ready-to-date ships."
The official said that the problem has grown over time because the old ships were decommissioned without being replaced.
He complained that none of the frigates from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were ready to be part of the fleet.
National Trust snigs to the secret life of bats
New research from an area in Scotland Highland tries to reveal how bats use the landscape when they hunt.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and will help in the work of future conservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scientists from Scotland's National Trust and follows common bats, dwarf bats, long-edged bats and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at carefully selected sites in the area to record the activities of bats during the season.
Data will also be collected from staff from NTS and volunteers using hand-held detectors.
Deep analysis of the sound recordings will reveal the frequencies of bats and show which species does what.
To produce a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour, a report and a map of the habitat are made.
NTS Rob Dewar's natural conservation consultant hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important and how they are used by the various species.
This knowledge can help to determine the benefits of habitat conservation efforts such as the establishment of meadows, and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has fallen dramatically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect the shipowners and restrict their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger. The same can fly traps, chemical treatment of building materials and attacks from pets.
Flagmus are actually not blind.
But because they primarily hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to locate insects and fly outside obstacles.
NTS, which is responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect nests and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organization has even made Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve in the area around Threeave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten of Scotland's bat species.
The district manager, David Thompson, says it is an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Three, we have a very good area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and the whole good habitat.
You know a lot of things you don't know about bats, so work here and elsewhere can help you understand what they need to do to thrive."
He stresses the importance of looking for bats before performing maintenance tasks on properties, as the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and pups, thereby risking the destruction of an entire local population.
The bat is at peace, and it is illegal to kill, bother or disturb them or their nest.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project leader for Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to give a hand with.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we have, we don't know how the populations evolve."
Ronaldo rejects rape appeals while lawyers apply for a German journal
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape charges against him for "fake news" and says that people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news media Der Spiegel, who brought the allegations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rapeing an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It's claimed that he paid her $375.000 to keep it secret, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
Some hours after the allegations had been published, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticised the information to be "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-fold winner of Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"They will promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man, and everything is good," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel because of the charges, which they have, according to Reuters, called "an unforgivable publication of suspicions of the privacy sphere".
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player would seek compensation for "mortal corruption in a class corresponding to the accusation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The event was reportedly taking place in June 2009 in a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room where he had to rape her anal according to the reported report at Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said that he was "a good guy 99% of the time" gripped by "one percent".
The file claims that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her photographed damage to a hospital, but that she later agreed to an agreement outside the court because she felt "bad for retribution" and worried about being "publicly eroded".
The 34-year-old now says that she wants to circumvent the agreement, as she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo faced a shift from Manchester United to Real Madrid when the event was due to take place and changed in the summer to the Italian big club Juventus for 100 million €.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will forever regret" to lose car manufacturers
Britain "will regret it forever" if it lost its status as leading car manufacturer worldwide after Brexit, said business minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "disquieting" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily reduce production at the Burnston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting time at the border in case of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, where 90% of them were exported to the rest of the EU.
"As I see it, production will stop at our factory if Britain smokes out of the European Union at the end of March," said the Managing Director at Burnston, Marvin Cooke.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, express the fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says that they will close their Mini factory in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers relates to the risks of the supply chain in the event of termination without agreement.
Toyota's production runs on a tight schedule, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems could arise at the border, which, according to the car industry, could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day's production at the Derbyshire factory, and then production would be stopped, the company said.
Clark says that Theresa Mays Chequers plan for future negotiations with the European Union is "composite so that these checks at the border are precisely avoided."
"We need an agreement. We want the best deal that not only allows us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success but to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The statements from Toyota and other manufacturers point to the fact that we need to be able to continue what has been successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would have stopped, but in the longer term higher prices would reduce the competitiveness of the factory, which will ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnston for 24 years and is a joint trustee at the factory, says that his members are becoming more and more concerned: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they won't come back."
A government spokesperson said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with the Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein may "be postponed for a week more", when the issue of the Supreme Court Notified Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is looking at the special prosecutor Robert Mueller over his shoulder during his investigation of Russian election interference, relations between Trump's helpers and Russia and the president's possible obstacle to the course of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Minister of Justice and thus risk the independence of Mueller has been a gossip in Washington for months.
The New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein was considering carrying a microphone in order to engage with Trump and the opportunity to dismiss the President through the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and the rumor was that he would quit.
Instead, a meeting was agreed on Thursday with Trump, which at that time was at the UN headquarters in New York.
Trump said that he would "don't prefer" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate's judicial committee, where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse, would testify.
Last Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate's election.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was at Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked to meet Rosenstein, she said: "There is no fixed date. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed a week with everything that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we must see, and I like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders has not held a press meeting in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press meetings wasn't because of TV reporters playing for the gallery, but added, "I don't disagree with them playing up to the camera."
She said that the direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
"The President receives more questions from the press than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting a source, "We've looked at the figures."
Press meetings will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We are trying to give it a rich opportunity, and you have seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it will be in the place of the press meeting when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often receives questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open hearings or press meetings with high-ranking guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why when he made an improvised and at times mystical figure in front of the present journalists.
Minister of Health contacts EU staff in the Scottish Health Service after Brexit worries
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
Scotland's government has already committed itself to paying for the applications for permanent residence of EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on withdrawal have continued and decisions are expected in the autumn.
But the British Government has also increased their preparation for a possible Brexit without an agreement.
I know it must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the efforts of each individual employee, regardless of their nationality.
Collaborators from outside and outside the EU come with valuable experiences and competences that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare system for the benefit of patients and the local community.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we would like you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie has an emergency operation after head injury.
The lineback from Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie was quickly operated after having suffered a head injury on Saturday's 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores, reports it from Tennessee Mike Organ.
First trainer for Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the incident took place before the break.
"He went out to the sideline and just fell down out there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before they put him on a stretcher and took him into further investigation.
A spokesman from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are no "any details about the type or extent of the damage yet", and Tennessee State tries to find out when he incurred the damage.
Abercrombie studies in the second year and is in the process of her first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five tackles last Saturday before he left the fight, which gives him 18 tackles combined this season.
Foreign buyers are charged a higher stamp fee when they buy houses in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged a higher stamp fee when they purchase property in the UK. The extra money must, according to the Conservative Party, help the homeless.
This move must dampen Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp tax will hit those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to provide 120 £ million a year to the homeless.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp fee when purchasing properties in the UK for the benefit of the homeless.
It will be considered as an attempt to respond to Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper dwellings and going after them with the highest income.
The rise in the stamp tax will hit people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK. The income from this must be used for the government's struggle to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The additional fee, which is added to the current stamp fee and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-home purchases and purchases to rent, can reach 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to collect 120 £ million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are bought by people living abroad, making prices rise and making it more difficult for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "spouse cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill comes only weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in the stamp duty to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices up by buying land they don't use. He asked May to drop the quotas on cheap dwellings to solve Britain's "damaging housing situation."
Corbyn has proposed an eye-catching number of housing reforms, including the control of rent prices and the withdrawal of the landlord's ability to put people on the street if they comply with the rental contract.
He will also strengthen the possibility of building public housing buildings.
May said: "In the last year I said that I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life will be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who will live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right that it is as easy for foreign companies and people who live outside the UK to buy homes as for hardworking British.
For too many, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the unworthyness of sleeping on the street is still too widespread."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become Scotland's coach."
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his 'ultimative goal' is at some point becoming Scotland's coach.
The 42-star shot enjoys the challenge of revitalizing the North East club, which now has third place in the League One, three points from the top.
He switched to the Stadium of Light this summer after looking St. Mirren back in the Scottish Premiery last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a game with the B team, and that was it," said Ross BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland on Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it's always drawn me.
However, that option would only arise if I were successful in training clubs."
Ross' predecessors who train for Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says that he had no concern about following so established names in such a large club and had previously refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I'm measuring success from whether 'I can get this club back in the Premier League.'
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly hears at the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I'm sure I'll only see myself successful here if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years in his career as a coach after a period as an assistant trainer at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Hearts training loss.
Then he helped Alloa get back after having moved down to the third best row and transformed the St Mirren from the shakedown to the title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real divide," he remembers the time in Alloa.
"I sincerely believed that training was the right thing for me, more right than being a player.
It sounds strange because I did well, served wisely and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There's a lot of things you're going through on a weekly basis.
There's still the kind of stress and pressure that train, but it just feels right.
I've always wanted to train, and now I'm doing it. I haven't felt more comfortable with myself throughout my adult life."
You can hear the interview at Sportsound on Sunday 30 September at Radio Scotland between 12 noon and 13.00 BST.
The best time for a beer is Saturdays at 5.30 p.m., showing survey
The heat wave this summer has increased earnings for England's pubs, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
Sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while sales in restaurants decreased by 4.8%, showing figures.
Peter Martin, who is a business consultant at CGA and has collected the figures, said: "Continue sunshine and England's unexpected long World Cup has meant that July follows June's pattern where the pubs experienced more sales of 2.8 %, except that the restaurants are harder hit now.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurants in June only got worse in July.
Pubber and bars with a focus on the sale of beverages made it clear best and experienced progress similar to the restaurants’ decline.
Pubber with focus on food led in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want something to drink.
Across pubs and bark chains, the sales of beverages increased by 6,6 % for the month, while food fell by 3,3 %."
Paul Newman, who analyses the service industry, said: "The results continue to be the trend we have seen since late April.
When it comes to sale on the out-of-home market, weather and major social or sporting events are the main factors.
It is no surprise that restaurants are still fighting, although a fall in sales of 4.8% year after year will hurt really up to rising costs.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will give a hard needed breathing room."
The total increase in sales combined for pubs and restaurants including new openings was 2.7% in July, showing the fall in newly started brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, who monitors sales figures for the English pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyses data from 47 different groups. Their annual turnover is more than 9 £ billion and they are leading in the area.
Every five children have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
Every five children, down to 11 years of age, have secret accounts on social media, which they hide from their parents and teachers, showing research.
A survey of 20,000 school students in grade 4-9 reveals growth in "False Insta" pages.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content
20 % of students said they have a "main account" that they can show their parents
Every five children down to 11 years of age create accounts on the social media that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 students from the 4th grade and forward reveals violent growth in "False Insta" accounts – a reference to the image sharing service Instagram.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content is being put up.
20 % of the students said they have a "main account" which they can show their parents, while they also have private.
A mother who fell over her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, saw a teenager who called on others to "attack me".
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmisstresses' Conference (HMC) for Private Schools found that 40 % of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to having private accounts.
The leader of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "It's scary that so many teenagers are tempted to make online profiles where their parents and teachers can't find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics at the Governing Body’s annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most winning athlete, and President Ian Bettie described the shift as a good opportunity for those making decisions on sport to benefit from her great 10-year experience at international level.
"Eilith enjoys great reputation in the athletic world of Scotland, Great Britain and the rest of the world, and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will benefit from getting her on the board," Beatie said.
Doyle said: "I will try to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope that I can help and help out a direction for sport in Scotland."
The American, who won two of his four Olympic medals in the 200- and 400-metre cycles at the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, and who are now often a commentator for the BBC, could not pursue a transitory ischemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote, "A month ago, I was struck by a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time would show if I would get on top of it and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm perfectly well, learned to walk again and do today agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for chest pump that compares mothers to cows, gets mixed reception online
A breast pump company has shared opinions online with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent chest pump", the technological consumer magazine has published a sarcastic music video-inspired advertisement, which must show the freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a diet full of hay, to a song in which, among other things, it reads: "Yes, I milk myself, but you see no tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, this isn't yvere, it's my breasts."
It says, "Pump it out, pump it out, I'll feed my baby, pump it out, pump it out, I'll milk my bosom."
But the advertisement, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has led to controversy online.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received a mixed reception from the viewers. Many say it makes fun of the "reeds" of the milk industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and fed before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth", wrote a user.
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly in an amme bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another said, "I understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump to mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added, "What an insensitive advertisement."
Others defended the advertising, and a woman admitted that she thought the song was "incrediblely funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I would have had one.
Lactation made me feel exactly like a cow.
The advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a brilliant product," one wrote.
Another commented: "It is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who pump milk (often in their workplace or in toilets) and feel like 'cows'.
It is not an advertisement that praises or criticises the milk industry."
At the end of the video the women reveal that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept of advertising is based on the fact that many women who breast-feed say that they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely silent, has no pipes or hoses and fits discreetly in an amme-bh, giving women the freedom to move, keep their children and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, a partner and director of Mother, wrote: "The pump from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between breast-feeding mothers and dairy cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast-pumping while we showed in a entertaining and recognizable way the freedom that the new pump can give."
It's not the first time that Elvie's pump made headlines.
In London Fashion Week a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Several hundred migrant children secretly moved to tent camp at the border of Texas
The number of detained migrant children has exploded, although the number of bordergoers has not changed. This is partly due to a tougher rhetoric and the tougher laws of the Trump administration that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared their ability to stay in the country by coming forward and receiving a child.
The return risk increased in June when the authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult household members should provide fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of Imigration and Customs Enforcement, witnessed to Congress and reported that they had arrested several people who sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70 % of the arrestees had clean criminal records.
"Although 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors' households are living illegally in the country, a large proportion of them are alien criminals.
So we're still chasing those people," said Albence.
In the attempt to deal with children’s cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to meet in court within one month of their detention.
Many use video calls instead of meeting up and speaking their case for legal residence to an immigration judge.
Those who are judged unjustified for stay are deported quickly.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression that can lead to violent outcomes or escape attempts, it is from relief workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
People who advocate better relationships say that these risks are more pronounced on larger plants such as Tornillo, where size makes it harder to keep an eye on whether a child is suffering.
They added that relocation to a tentlands town without mental preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to friends can build traumas that many already struggle with.
Syria informs American, French and Turkish "crowd forces" that they must withdraw immediately
When Syria's Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moualem, spoke to the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces' stay in the country is illegal and under the pretext of combating terrorism, and they will "be met with similar means."
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war against terror “near is over” in Syria, where more than 350,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have fled from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "to fight this crucial war until we have cleared out all Syrian areas" for both terrorist groups and for "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria who primarily train and advise Kurdish and Syrian forces who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war - torn country.
In the field of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were good enough for them to return home, and then accused "some Western countries" of "dispersal of unjustified fear" that made the refugees stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help shape these return operations," he said.
"They police what was supposed to be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that aid will not be made available to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to set up a buffer zone in the last large rebel-controlled city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
Because of the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia was avoided against the province of three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would go after jihadists from the Nusra Front, a starting group of Al-Qaeda, which will be "dead out".
The UN's post-war staff Staffan de Mistura hopes to call at the first meetings of the new committee in order to outline an post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for an election.
Moualem has set the conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the committee and has stated that the work of the panel should be limited to "reviewing the legislation of the present Constitution", and warned against interference.
That's why Trump's going to win another presidential term.
From that logic, Trump is likely to be re-elected in 2020, unless the trial and scandals close his pre-term presidential term, as many liberal viewers may hope for.
In what undoubtedly will be "the most dramatic end of a presidential term ever!"
At once, there is no sign of starvation.
Since 2014, the audience figures in the best transmission time have almost doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best time to compare with 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBCs The Rachel Maddow Show has the most viewers with up to 3.5 million in the evenings with great news.
"It's a spectacular thing that people are attracted to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the ABC drama Designed Survivor about a leader of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress Building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy author and author behind "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snowing Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd vote on Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,' said Scovell.
Kaosset has entertainment value.
However, contrary to all other television programmes, the stories coming from Washington can determine the matter between Roe and Wade, whether families of refugees can reunite and the health of the world economy.
Changing the channel is only the most privileged marvel.
And yet it's about more than being enlightened citizen when you see six hours of panel debate, where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background," when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's menace jacket at $15,000 ("made with hybrids", The Washington Post wrote) and the implications of Story Daniels' living descriptions of Trumps anatomy.
At least I'll never see Super Mario the same way.
"Something that makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, managing director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump show's rotating crew and daily surprises (drifts with N.F.L, praise to Kim Jong-un.)
But if you miss a paragraph, you're off.
When I got hold of Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was sitting inside and watching MSNBC, while he took up CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, to be heard in the Senate Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court had to be decided.
"I remember when we made all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, 'That's the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large sums will find their way to the close middle choice for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district receives large sums of money. As a result of the equalization of two "Congressional Districts" two congressmen are fighting for the same seat.
This recently surrounded suburbs in Pittsburg creates problems for the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb stands up against another seated Congressman, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which overlaps strongly with the new 17.
The maps were redrafted after Pennsylvania's Supreme Court in January, condemning the fact that the old territory was unlawfully set up in the hands of the Republicans.
The struggle for the new 17th district has started a struggle for financial resources between the committees of the major parties, the Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republic of Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a choice of great care in March's special choice for Pennsylvania 18th district.
The seat has been on the Republican hands for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States was considering punishing El Salvador for support to China, but redeciding
Diplomates noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners threw Trump's management team out.
Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call leading US diplomats back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the foreign ministry's spokeswoman in an outing earlier this month.
But it was only El Salvador that was punished, and they got about 140 million dollars from the United States in 2017 to, among other things, drug control, development and financial support.
The penalties proposed, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on admission permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials had a top conference on security and economic development, which should continue last year's meeting, which was considered a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
In mid-September, however, the Topembeds made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway and thus dropped the thought of punishment to El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is going to speak to the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, in order to send a signal on the importance that the Americans attach to the meeting, said diplomats.
And the three U.S. agents secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new severe demands or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson for Bolton of the White House did not want to comment on the details of the case, which were described by three US officials, including two diplomats who would like to talk about internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the basis of a condition of anonymity.
Know History
The next obstacle could well be the special prosecutor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to the investigation, which there is considerable and publicly available evidence of.
According to the report, Mueller will also direct his investigation into the question of whether the Trump campaign was secretly cooperating with Russia on the attack on the elections.
If Congress were to come on new hands, Trump is likely to be held responsible while he is preparing to meet again the voters and, of course, a jury of his platoons.
There are many uncertainties and I do not claim that Trumps are finally inevitable – and so are his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must all make choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
In 1938 German officers were ready to put in a coup against Hitler if only the West had been able to resist him by supporting the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not grasp the possibility of avoiding the bloodbath after that.
It is about such turning points that the axis of history turns, and the irreversibly march of democracy to - or declines.
In the United States there are now several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who decides the future of Mueller's investigation, Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been warm since this newspaper was able to announce that last year he had proposed making hidden footage of the President and challenged his suitability for office.
Rosenstein says The Times' manufacture is unclear.
"How do we react if F.B.I.'s recent inquired investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is suspended or not properly implemented – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, more importantly, will we vote for a Congress to hold Trump responsible for the Mid-term elections?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the self-same Nazi regime, who once occupied my embassy's homeland.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath lights on the table with the garden cross.
How can I be anything but optimistic about that in my luggage?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic ahead of the fight against SK Rapid Vienna
Rangers take on Thursday against SK Rapid Wien. After the impressive undecided result in Spain against Villaarreal earlier this month, they will, with a victory against the Austrians, have good opportunities to move on from Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented the midway player Graham Dorrans from getting the season debut before the 2-2 battle against Villaarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a springboard for something even bigger.
"It was a good point for us, for Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the game with the belief that we could bring something home, and we got a point.
Perhaps we could have gone home, but all in all, it was probably a reasonable result.
They were probably the best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were the best team.
On Thursday, there will be another great European evening.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they got a good result in the last fight. But with the audience behind us I am sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
The last year has been hard because of everything that has happened to my injuries and the changes to the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can go on now, put the last season behind us, and make success."
Angry over pension savings make women sleepless
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared for, there were only a few people who talked to the family about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationwise study reported that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% told them they were talking to their children about it.
"Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do anything to start the conversation," says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life assurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not tell them in good time about your wishes.
Use your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices can be crucial factors for cost.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term care can be financed, for example, by means of a traditional long-term care insurance, cash-payment life insurance or self-insurance with your own resources – as long as you have the money to do so.
Fix the legal documents: Take the legal battles up.
Get a mandate to get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and to make sure that doctors and health care professionals comply with your wishes, in case you cannot communicate yourself.
Consider, too, an economic mandate.
In this case, you appoint a trusted person who can make financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you do not have the opportunity to do so.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that one of your aged parents needs urgent medical attention and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Get all these details down on the font, so you're ready.
"It's not just a question of the economy – who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What medicine?
Who's looking after the dog?
Get the plan in place."
Man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a trip in town.
The victim was in the 40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, the diaphragm and the hand.
Officers describe the shooting that took place around 02:30, as "indiscriminately."
The victim didn't see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police call on witnesses to stand up.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and a tsunami which, on Friday, hit the Indonesian town of Pau.
Since the communication routes are out of play, emergency aid workers have not been able to receive information from the Dongila Regiment, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake hit.
Here are some facts about Palu and Dongila, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesian province and is at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami hit.
Dongila is a regiment that extends over 300 km of coastline on the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
In 2017, the government, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the central sulawesian economy, especially in the Dongila coastal area.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but takes place mainly in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's disaster centre, Palu and Dongela have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed several hundred houses in Dongila.
In 1996, Dongela was once again hit by a tsunami that killed nine.
Indonesia is seismologically on the so-called lightning in the Pacific and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the greatest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on 26 December, which struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, including over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and not until April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake, which measured 6.8, hit south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, triggering a tsunami, which sprang towards the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 hit near the town of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake that measured 7.5, hit one of the Mentawai islands out of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya regiment in Aceh and spread destruction and panic when the population was reminded of 2004's deadly earthquake and tsunami.
A tsunami was not triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapsing buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquake hit Indonesia's tourist-ø Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin’s oldest son charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and vice president candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, the prevention of home violence reporting and to oppose arrest, according to the report that Saturday was issued by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he picked up the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is in custody in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a bail of $500 without certainty, reports KTUU.
He was put before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "suddenly not guilty", reports the network.
Palin is charged with three Class A violations, which can lead to a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B offence that can lead to a penalty on a single day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not the first time that Palin has been charged with offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the assault.
The case is pending at Alaska's Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, preventing the notification of a violent crime at home, as well as weapons possession in the affected condition of the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of giving her a blow in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups after explaining his son's violent conduct with PTSD as a result of his posting in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia: several hundred deaths
At least 384 people have died, after an earthquake on Friday struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is free of electricity and communication routes, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit just south of central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On the social media, there are videos that show the moment where the earthquake strikes.
Several hundred people were gathered to a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami sprang toward the coast.
Public prosecutors are trying to get terrorist suspects in NYC sentenced to the rare death penalty
Public prosecutors are trying to sentence the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people – a rare penalty, which was last sentenced to a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov used a car rental from the construction market Home Depot to perform an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who got in the way were harmed.
As a basis for the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious personal injury.
According to the legal document, the death penalty is a possible result of both these terms.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury was able to present Saipov with an indictment of 22 points, including eight accusations of murder in connection with gangster activities, typically used by public prosecutors in organised crime cases, and an accusation of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "wide planning and preparation", said the prosecutors and described Saipov's conduct as "unholy, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, body injury and loss for families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," states the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since New York's southern district last brought charges in a case of death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but ended up getting a lifelong prison sentence in September 2009.
The death penalty was imposed in a state case in New York City in 1953. Then the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov came from Uzbekistan and, according to the legal documents, did not show any sign of evidence in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was well aware of his actions.
According to the charges, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag hanged up at his hospital room, told the cops.
He has refused to do so in the 22 points of the accusation.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that they "of course were disappointed" at the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and lifelong prison sentence without the possibility of release will only extend the trauma to all those involved," said Patton.
The defenses of Saipov had previously asked the prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
The Conservative Minister believes that NIGEL FARAGE should take over the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a demonstration at the conservative meeting today.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians could "mark the pressure" of the Eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May's own ministers had said that Farage should take over the negotiations with the European Union.
The British Conservative Member Peter Bone stated to the Birmingham demonstration that Britain would have "be gone out now" if Farage had been a Brxit dealer.
May’s challenge to creating a gathering in the deeply divided party is stressed by the fact that conservative remainers participate in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan on track under attack by both brexites, remainers and the European Union.
Her allies insist that despite the refusal, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – thereby forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or "kaos".
To the show Leave Means Leave in Solihull informed Bone that he would scrape the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we would have been out now," he said.
The Minister of Wellingborough added, "I'll fight for Brexit, but we're going to scrape Chequers."
On the background of his EU resistance, he said: "We did not fight World Wars to be subordinate to anyone.
We will decide our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected that the public position should have changed since the 2016 vote: "That the British people should have changed their mind and would like to stay in the European Union is completely wrong."
The Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also for the demonstration and told the journalists: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers Plan is up-to-date in the wider population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is up-to-date in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the street and get us elected.
Now get out of here, Chequers, and start listening.
As a point to May, she added: "Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the record that politicians should be able to "mark the pressure" if they fail the vote in 2016.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They will betray Brexit, but we are gathered to tell them that we will not let them go with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "You must make sure that the political class that is on the verge of betraying Brexit can feel the pressure.
"We are mobilizing the army here in the country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until we have become an independent, self-government and proud Britain."
While marching remainers through Birmingham before a two-hour recording in the city center.
Spreading activists fanned with Conservative Mod Brexit banners after the forming of the group this weekend.
The Labour colleagues Lord Adonis made fun of the security problems with the Conservatives' party app before the meeting.
"It is the people who claim to have control over the IT systems and technology of Canada, of border controls, of free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he said.
"It's all a joke.
There's nothing called a good Brexit," he added.
Warren "considers strongly" to stand up to the presidential elections
Member of the House of Representatives Senator Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly to stand up to the presidential elections" after the mid-term elections in November.
According to Boston Globe, the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about their future during an office meeting on Saturday in the Western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticized Donald Trump, will in November try to re-elect the Government Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired at the Trumps Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
You've been wondering if she'd challenge Trump by 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the voters at the town hall, since Trump took over the office.
A participant asked her if she's planning to go up to the presidential elections.
Warren said it's time that "Women go to Washington and repair our political system, and it takes a woman to the front."
Arresting in case of shooting at LSU's Sims
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on Friday for the shooting raid at Wayde Sims, the basketball player from LSU.
The Baton Rouge police announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested on Friday for an ET news meeting at 11 p.m.
They had on Friday released a video of the shooting to ask for help to identify a man on the recordings.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was hit by bullets in the head and died of the injuries," said police chief Murphy J. Paul, according to the medium 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to have been present, in possession of a weapon and to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and is now in the police in East Baton Rouge district custody.
Sims was a two meter high third year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. Last season he played 32 games, started inside ten and played an average of 17.4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's grand prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the World Championship, according to team orders giving him victory over Sebastian Vetel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Botta qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a crucial role in the race.
From the lead position Bottas got a good start and was close to beating Hamilton completely off when he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vetel to attack his teammate.
Vetel ran pit as the first, and let Hamilton fight with traffic at the back of the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes car went into pit a round later and came out behind the vettel, but Hamilton came again in front, as the Ferrari rider, after any wheel contact, had to reluctantly leave the inner track after a double defense at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the rear row and was number seven after the first round of his 21st birthday.
Then he led a large part of the race as he failed to change tyres to take the fourth place of Kimi Raikkonen in an attempt to complete quickly.
He had to take a piss on 44nd rounds, but he could not increase the pace of the last eight rounds, so Raikkonen secured the fourth place.
"It's a difficult day because Valteri made it great all weekend and really was a gentleman when he let me come by.
The team did an incredible piece of work to secure us both first and second place," said Hamilton.
Really Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a election meeting on Saturday because she insisted that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh for sex abuse.
At a election meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention the testimony that Ford had made in front of the United States Senate Justice Committee, but said instead that the events in the Senate showed that people were "evil and disgusting and dishonest".
"One thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks, and then they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember that?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember her answer... was it you who leaked the document – "Oh, uh, what?
No, no.
I haven't leaked anything."
Hey, hold on a second.
Have we leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything," he added in an imitation of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter about Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's accusations, and I haven't leaked her story," said Feinstein to the comet according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I have."
But her denial was not well received by the President, who said during Saturday's election session: "I tell you that it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
During the President's continued defence of the nominated judge to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual abuse by three women, Trump proposed that the Democrats use the allegations to benefit their own case.
"They spare no funds in their efforts to take back power.
You can see the wickedness, the repulsions, they don't care who they're going to believe to gain power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars did well again after Friday's Elite League fight against Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee last Saturday.
Giants came in front quickly with two targets of attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie settled on their own before Dwyer again brought Giants in front.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat of Adam Keefe's team that came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Friday's battle in Belfast.
It was the fourth session of the season between the sides, where Giants went out as conquerors in the previous three battles.
Dwyer set out in the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assist from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as an assist, when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy first period, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt was behind Cownie's compensation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Giants came in front of the first break when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard rebalanced with a fine goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen lead Dundee ahead of the first time in the fight late in the second period, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four out of their five fights, are at home in Milton Keynes for their next fight on Friday.
Air traffic controller died to ensure that hundreds of aircraft passengers escaped earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as completely after he died to ensure that a plane with several hundred passengers came safely to the ground.
More than 800 people are dead and many are missing after a major earthquake last Friday hit the Sulawesi island and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks continue to ravage the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although the colleagues of 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung fled for life, he refused to leave his seat in the swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He was back in his place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which held the runway, got safely in the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was falling apart.
He died later at the hospital.
According to Australian ABC News, Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"We're crazy," he added.
The authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach several thousand, and the country's disaster preparedness states that there is limited access to the cities of Dongila, Sigi and Boutong.
"Death is expected to rise because there are still many dead bodies in the ruins, and it is not possible to reach them," said the spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six - meter - high waves have destroyed Palu, which holds a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly emergency aid and supplies in.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to Sky News: "Every minute comes a new ambulance with more bodies.
There's a shortage of clean water.
All the shops are robbed."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we do not know what we come up with.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday, and said to the country's military: "I ask all of you to work around the clock to carry out all the duties of the evacuation.
Are you ready?" he said CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombrok earlier this year, where more than 550 people died.
Air Force in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is missed after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed in Pacific law in Micronesia now says that a man is missing, even though it had previously been announced that all 47 passengers and crew members were evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
According to a press release, Air Niugini states that on Saturday afternoon it was unable to locate a male passenger.
The airline announced that they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and police to try and find the man.
The airline has not returned to requests for more information about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped to save the other passengers and the crew after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport of Chuuk.
Officials said Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline states that six passengers remained at the hospital until Saturday, and that they were all in a stable state.
It is still not clear what caused the crash and the exact order of events.
The airline and the American marine both state that the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane landed on very low water.
"It was really lucky," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers could go in water to life to get to the emergency exits of the sinking aircraft.
He said the crew panicked and shouted and he had a minor head injury.
The American marine said that sailors who were working on renovating a berth nearby also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to carry persons ashore before the plane sank at about 30 meters depth.
Data from Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents with PNG registered airlines over the last two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analysts determine timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The DA closed his evidence on Saturday during the appeal for a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analysts at the US Ministry of Justice, Paul Rowlett, gave testimony for several hours as expert witnesses in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used teleinformation to combine the course of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said that he got location data from several different cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to his previous claims, writes The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time he had claimed that he, along with his friend Michael Sanford, visited the police Sanford.
Sanford sat down on the witness stand Saturday and told me he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he was "l lied because my truck was in Nashville".
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they had known each other only for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the jury to roll later that day.
The High Breed: What is political hiphop?
A hiphoptrio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that hiphop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They will return to the starting point and make political hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently been given a revitalization in Britain because of artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
A nanny in New York is suing couples after firing with "racist" text messages
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for discriminatory firing after having sent an SMS message by an error from the mother who complained that she was "still a black person".
The couple denied that they were racists, but compared the case with "expression".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed her horror at finding out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEJ, NOT A SORT PERSON," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her fault, it fired "unfavorable" Plasco-Flaxman Giselle Maurice and said that their former nanny, who from African-Americans, had been bad at work, and that instead she expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day work and sent home in a Uber.
Now Giselle Maurice is suing for the fire, as well as compensation for 350 dollars a day for the six months she should have lived with the family, although this was agreed without a contract.
"I'd like to show them that you can't allow yourself to do something like that," she said to the newspaper on Friday and added "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have defended themselves with the fact that they are not racists and that the firing of Maurice was justified because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife had come to send her something that she would not have said.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," said Joel Plasco to The Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone whom you had been rude to, even if it had happened by mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the case with "expression" and that his wife had given birth two months earlier and found herself in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you really going for someone like that?
It is not very kind," added the investment advisor.
Although the trial is still under way, the Court of Human Rights has already dismissed the couple on social media and shaken their behaviour and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publisher feared that readers could not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was recorded for publication, said of the letter: "It is difficult to imagine to be the one who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's really fun to read now when you know how popular Paddington was."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman on the BBC, before he was inspired to write the children's book about a little twig, would have been optimistic, even though his story was rejected, and that the 60th year for the publication of the books was "bitter sweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father in all modesty was proud of her success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't like to boast," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt as if you had a child who achieved something: You are proud of them, even though it really is not your profit.
I think a little bit he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Even though it was his work and his imagination, he used to say it was Paddington's fault."
Said goodbye to the dying daughter over the phone
After the landing, her daughter was driven to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors in vain tried to save her life.
"Nath called at regular intervals to say that it was really bad and that she probably did not survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that she would die in the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my darling.
I'll see you soon.
I'll see you.
The medicine she had received to keep her heart moving slowly lost its effect.
She was dead short before, and now her body shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to get along."
Finally, the mourning Ednan-Laperouse went on board the plane with the other passengers who did not know what she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I bent my head, and my tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sad women are trying to stop suicide jumpers
Two women who have lost relatives for suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have arranged maps on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he had a depression, and 18 years old when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to experience the grief I'm through every day," she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with an infected smile.
"His smile was known to everyone.
People said his smile lit up the room."
However, he stopped working before he died because he was feeling really bad.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him after taking his life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid if it spreads."
Sharon Davis made the cards to "tell people that there is someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don't go with your thoughts yourself – you have to talk to someone."
Sharon Davis' long-time friend Kelly Humphreys lost his girlfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about him being sad or depressed or something," she said.
"Some days before Christmas, he began to change.
When the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them at all."
She said that his death was very traumatic for them, but that they have to get through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
It's torn us apart.
But we all have to continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still unclear while the FBI starts investigating
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for – a limited time-limited study – we could perhaps have a little consensus," said Flake on Saturday and added that he feared that the comet "falling from the hind" in the middle of the locked party-shared situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican not support the fact that the FBI did their investigation?
Their restraint is due to timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if, as expected, the Republicans fail, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they would like to have elected as the highest judge in the country.
George W. Bush called Senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and thus met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has finished its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the decisive voice and choose him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean shoppers 'falls' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean shoppers in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korea Association Ministry and said that there were 1,127 shoppers last year compared to 2.706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher figures due to people smugglers were contributing to the changed figures.
Pyongyang has not given any official comments.
In time, most North Korea drop-offs are offered nationality in South Korea.
The government of South Korea states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border on North Korea and which is easier to cross than the highly guarded demilitarised zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the dropouts as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, so they are often forced to home.
The relationship between North and South Korea – which is still technically at war – has improved significantly over the last few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries of Pyongyang met to discuss the stranded negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happens after the historic meeting in June between the American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work against an atomic-free Korea on an overall level.
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the United States for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no belief in our national security, and under such circumstances it is excluded that we will be decompressing ourselves," said Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's unfit for the Supreme Court.
The president of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated as Supreme Justice, "Hysterical", and said that his temper was not fit for the Supreme Court.
Pelosis Comment came in an interview Saturday to Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, one would have called her hysterical," said Pelosi of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh rejected the emotional allegations that he had committed a sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he spoke about his family and his years in high school, he almost cried out and was crying.
He also condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him "grotesque and a coordinated characterism" arranged by the left, who was angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the Presidential post in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not sit in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was preoccupied with the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with the statements and the way he went after Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi road around when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to a kingdom if he was confirmed and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I want to say that if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, but certainly in the court he's sitting in now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. appeal court.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about the possible decisions of Kavanaugh in the context of Obama's health reform or the Roe v. Wade abortion case because he is considered to be a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions as to whether he would reverse certain previous Supreme Court decisions.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, predetermined person must contest a job as a judge and expect us to say 'Well, it is not just great'," said Pelosi.
And women have to use it.
It is a just outcome, several months and years of anger that crumbles over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal.
She continued: "I got great support from a woman who was the boss, who said that she also cried when she got angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the one she spoke to: "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she just kept on going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with an overweight of men, where I often cried out of anger, where I was taken at the neck of an older woman – a cold boss, who I had always been a little afraid of – and pulled out on the stairs.
"You must never let them see that you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They'll think you're sorry, and they'll be pleased they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, who at that time was a member of the Congress of the Democrats from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was exposed to having an affair on a boat named Monkey Business and withdrew as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and concluded that she could just as well act as a presidential candidate herself.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she laughed at me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, and they certainly did not need another candidate.
Some called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was back with fundraising, so she promised she wouldn't participate unless she collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she gave a speech that she would not stand up, she was overwhelmed by emotion – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration at the system that made it so difficult to raise money and reach out to voters instead of voters, and anger at sexism – that she got a lump in her throat.
"You could think I got a nervous combination," recalled Schroeder, "how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my gravestone?
"She cried"?
Such can the trade war between the United States and China be a benefit to Beijing
Opening salves in the trade war between the United States and China were loud, and although the battle is far from over, differences between countries can benefit Beijing in the long run, says experts.
The US President Donald Trump fired the first alert shot earlier this year by imposing customs duties on important Chinese export products, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
In principle, the biggest escalation of new customs duties this week, which affects goods for a value of USD 200 billion, applies to half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Mr Beijing has, each time, refunded, the most recent time by placing 5-10% customs duties on US goods for $60 billion.
China has vowed to follow the United States all the way, and the world's second largest economy probably does not give after just the moment.
If it makes Washington withdraw its demands, it means they give in, but for the President of China, Xi Jinping, it would be too embarrassing to bow to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its card correctly, the American pressure in the trade war can have a positive effect on China over the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
"A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can create ground for an economy that can get out of control in both countries, and it's actually much more dangerous than you thought," said Abigail Grace, research staff focused on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' to receive refugees, says Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that the country is ready for the refugees to return and asks for help to build the country, which has been destroyed by the war of more than seven years.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation is more stable and safe thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to control the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore a normal state of affairs.
All the circumstances are now in place for refugees to return to the country they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that hit their daily lives and their lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5,5 million acidity has fled from the country since 2011 when the war began.
Another six million people still in the country need emergency aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would like to take help to rebuild the hardened country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that helped to support the rebellion.
Europe ensures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won Ryder Cup 2018 and beat the US team 16.5 - 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy back when Captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points it required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had a hard time in most of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake at par 3 on the 16th hole, which made him lose the game against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari made good progress in all rounds and became 1 of a total of 4 players who have gained 5-0-0 since 1979, where the tournament's current format started.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 of the lowest rated European player, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
No. 1 on the World List, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in the baggage, Spain Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's most winning European with 25.5 career points.
"I don't normally cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a hard year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really glad to get the trophy back.
It is a team effort, and I am glad that I could help," said one emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He sends the tortoise to his compatriot John Ram, who fell the American golfing Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game Sunday.
"I am extremely proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It's a spear statistics for one of the best golfers ever who's won 14 big titles, only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had problems all weekend finding the form except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, said after his team's disappointing show: "I'm proud of the boys, because they fought for it.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe courage.
We lost.
Hat off for Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We want to regroup, and I want to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and then we get on with it.
I love the 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to lighten your hat.
We were defeated."
