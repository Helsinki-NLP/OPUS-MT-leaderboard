Well - meaning stewards are worried about "looking like a fool"
In some Councils, there is a proposal to have their title changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The concern has come on the basis of a plan to change the name of the council to the council.
Governments of all categories are concerned that this could make them laugh.
One worker’s steward said that his class was worried that “it rhymes with Twp and Pwp. ”
For readers who live outside Wales: at ease means twp wrong and pwp means dung.
The officer of the Plaid Cymru class said that the group as a whole was “dissatisfied” and made other suggestions.
A well-being officer said that his class had “open mind” about the change in name, but he pointed out that there was not much difference between the words MWP and Muppet (flon).
In this context, it can be noted that the w w w w is carried in the same way as the U in the Icelandic language.
The counsel, which is now working on a legal document to present the changes in names, said: “The decision on all the names of the members of the council will, of course, lie with the members themselves. ”
The Law on the Government of Wales (The Government of Wales Act 2017) gave the Norwegian Council the power to change its name.
In June, the Council published the results of a public poll, which showed great support for calling the Council of Justice.
With regard to the Council's title, the WMP (Welsh Parliament members) selected, while MWP received the most support from the public in its surveys.
According to news, stewards are now making other suggestions, but it may be difficult to reach an agreement with the president of the council, Elin Jones, who will submit a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The paper on the exchange will also include other changes in the way the council operates, including rules on the disfellowshipping of civil servants and the organisation of the committee system.
When talking about the bill begins, stewards will be able to make final decisions on their title.
Macedonians vote in elections to change names in the country
The voters will take a vote on Sunday about whether or not to change their name in “the Republic of North Macedonia. ”
This matter was put under a vote in an attempt to resolve a decade of conflict with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
The city of Athens has long argued that its northern neighbours’ names are equivalent to their demands on its territory and has repeatedly protested their applications for EU and NATO membership.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the change in his name, has said that he will not consider the elections valid.
However, supporters of the votes, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have said that the change in the name is simply a price to be paid for membership of the EU and NATO.
Church clock St. Martin sounds as churches in Harlem have difficulties
“ The older people I have spoken to said that before they could find a bar and a church on every corner, ” said Mr. Adams.
“Today there is neither to be found.”
He said it was understandable that the bar should be reduced.
“People have other ways of meeting” these days, he said.
"The people are no longer the center of the neighborhood where people meet regularly."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money that is leaving the estate will not last as long as the leaders expect “and sooner or later they will return to the beginning. ”
He added that it was possible for churches to be replaced by residential homes that would be full of people who would not help save the remaining cities of refuge.
“ The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white, ” he said, “and will therefore speed up the full closure of these churches, for most people who move into these camps are unlikely to become members of these churches. ”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the center of the Black Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin’s church decades later.
In the 1930 ’ s, the original white Methodist congregation moved away.
The nearby congregation of blacks took over the building.
The church of blacks took over St. Martin’s church, under the direction of Father John Howard Johnson, who took the initiative to destroy the 125th Street merchants, Harlem’s main shopping street, who longed to hire black workers or to give them heightened positions.
In 1939, the building was seriously damaged by fire, but in the congregation of Father Johnson’s class, the plans to rebuild it were made, and they were also made to build the clock game.
Father David Johnson, the son and successor of Father Johnson called the clock game proudly “the clock of the poor people. ”
The expert who played at the clock game in July called it another name: “A culture book” and“ a single historical musical instrument. ”
The expert, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first clock game in the world that a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, played on, but he moved over to a larger clock game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had not received anyone else in his place.
During the past few months, many architects and contractors have set their way to St. Martin, some of the church leaders and others of the bishops.
The church council - which oversees the attendance and is appointed church leaders - wrote the Episcopal in July and expressed its concern that the Episcopal “will seek to pass the cost over to ” the church council, even if it had not contributed to the architecture’s teaching and to the works sent by the bishops.
Some members complained about the lack of transparency in the Episcopal region.
A shark hurt a 13-year-old boy who strove for lobster in California
According to the authorities, a shark attacked a 13 - year - old boy and injured him on Saturday when the boy was looking for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster fishing season.
The attack was just before 7:00 in the morning near the Beacon’s Beach beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been choking along with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then wander over along with a group of others to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought that it was only a thrill to have grown old, but then “he became aware that the boy cried out, ‘ I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
"All his wood was torn up," Hammel said about what he saw when he came to the boy.
“I cried out to everyone to get out of the water, “It’s a shark in the water!” Hammel added.
The boy was transferred by a helicopter to the Rady-Bear Hospital in San Diego, where he is seriously injured.
The type of shark that attacked the boy is not known.
At a press conference, the chief of the Coast Guards, Larry Giles, said that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but he was not of a dangerous type of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered serious damage to the upper body.
The authorities closed beach access from the Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to Swami’s beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, for laboratory and safety reasons.
Giles said that more than 135 different types of sharks were in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plan to have a field in the UK’s clean product market
Sainsbury’s plans to do a job at Boots, SuperDrug, and Debenhams with cosmetics shelves in a mall style and with specialized assistants.
This is part of the plan to enter the UK market for beauty, which is worth £2.8 billion, and is increasing as fashion and home goods are sold down. The larger retail stores will be tested in 11 shops all over the country and will be put up in more stores next year if it goes well.
The investment in cosmetics is part of a large market to use a shelf lock that was previously used by televisions, microwaves, and household goods.
Sainbury’s claim is to double its cosmetic product selection to up to 3000 product types, including brand marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also have increased space with marked areas similar to those found in the stores such as Boots.
The store also intends to resell its Boutique product selection so that the majority of the goods are road-friendly, but younger consumers demand it to an ever greater extent.
In addition, the perfume store Fragrance Shop will test product status in two Sainbury’s stores, the first one opened in Croydon in South London last week and the next one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Networking and increasing the tendency of consumers to buy small amounts of food every day in the local shops means that economies of scale need to make more efforts to get people to come to their homes.
Mike Coupe, manager of Sainsbury’s, said that the stores would look more and more like the shopping malls when the trade chain tries to fight the low goods store Aldi and Lidl with more service and other goods than food.
Sainsbury’s has set up Argos camps in hundreds of stores and has also presented a number of Habitat camps since both chains were bought two years ago.
The first attempt by the store to revitalize their cosmetics and pharmaceuticals did not succeed.
Sainsbury ’s tried to cooperate with Boots around the year 2000, but it ended because of a disagreement about how to share the income from selling drugs in the supermarket.
The new strategy follows that Sainbury’s sold its 281-counted pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical stores, at 125 million pounds a year ago.
According to the policy, Lloyds will play a role in these plans by adding a large selection of luxury skin brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s marketing manager, said: “We have completely confused our cosmetic shelf to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specific training for staff who will be advised.
Our software selection is designed to meet all needs, and a fascinating environment and comfortable location will make us an exciting cosmetic store that transforms old business practices."
Peter Jones "goody" after Holly Willoughby cancels an 11 million-pound contract
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, became “an item” after the TV artist Holly Willoughby terminated an 11 million-pound contract with his company to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their home goods and accessories, Truly.
The company had been likened to Goop, the brand Gwyneth Paltrow.
Willoughby, 37 years of age, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has understood Peter Jones, the star of Dragons’ Den, with the painful result of stopping participation in a popular lifestyle company in the late hour to focus on new and rewarding deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones has been the “alternative industry” at a difficult meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business community in Marlow, Buckinghamshire when the TV lady popularly admitted that she did not have enough time for the home product and ancillary product label Truly for the new contracts worth up to GBP 1.5 million.
The company has been likened to Goop, a Gwyneth Paltrow brand, and was designed to double the assets of Willoughby, whose estimated value is £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37 years of age, Instagram announced that she was going to withdraw from Truly, Jones from Britain to stay in one of many of her summer homes.
One householder reported: “Trooly was the longest on Holly’s list of priorities.
This was supposed to be her future assignment, which would take her for the next two decades.
Its decision to stop came to the fore.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, but it was so short that the line went on the market.
There's a full layer of lips at Marlow headquarters ready to go for sale."
Experts believe that the elimination of This Morning, which is one of Britain’s most popular stars, can cost the company millions because of the high price of goods, ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household goods, and possibly lead to additional delays in selling the product line.
This could also mean the end of long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends of Jones and his wife, Toru Capp, for a decade.
Willoughby founded Truly along with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined them as Chairman of the Board in March.
The couples spend their summer vacations together, and Jones spends 40 percent of his share in Baldwin’s TV company.
Willoughby will be the official representative of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as the ITV factor I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We don’t want to say anything about his business. ”
Hard talk, “And then we fell in love. ”
He was concerned with the criticism he received from the media, for saying something that many would consider inappropriate for the President, and for being so positive for the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Said Trump and copied the voice of a reporter.
"I haven't left anything behind."
He noted that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
However, nuclear weapons have been stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the chief ambassador of North Korea, told international leaders at the Swedish General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not received a “appropriate response” from the United States at the first steps of North Korea towards nuclear disarmament.
He said that instead, the United States continued its business prayers in order to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more positive in his discussion.
“We’re getting along very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
Now our relationship is great."
He said that his attempts to improve Kim’s relationship had resulted in a positive result — an explosive test had stopped, hostages had been released, and the U.S. military earthly remnant had been returned.
He also warned his unusual approach to discussing his relationship with Kim.
“ It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into a troubling stadium, there were only 200 people standing there, ” said Trump, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
A flood and an earthquake in Indonesia are causing great damage to an island, hundreds of people have died.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, the international relief organizations were told that they were not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the people of Lombok had to flee from their homes, emergency conditions were not declared, which is the pretext for an international organization to operate in relief operations there.
“ Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it clear that they will not ask for assistance from international organisations, so this is difficult, ” said Ms. Sumbung.
Although the Save the Children organization is gathering teams to travel to Pala, it is not yet known when foreign relief workers can start working in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, the advocate of the country’s Disaster Institute, said that Indonesian rulers were evaluating the situation in Palestine to see if international organizations should be allowed to assist in the relief work.
Sadly, given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is poorly prepared to defend itself.
The airwaves have been built in Aceh, but they are rare sights on other shore lines.
It seems that the wake of the Pula tsunami was still increasing in man’s death, even though a warning was issued.
Even in the best circumstances, traveling between the many islands in Indonesia can be a challenge.
Natural disasters make planning even more complex.
A ship that has been at the port of Lombok to support the victims of the earthquake is now on its way to Pala, but it will take at least three days to get to the new site.
The president of Joko Widodo made it essential for his campaign to reinvigorate Indian transport routes and to make a great deal of money in the road and railways.
However, there has been a lack of funding for the control of Mr. Joko, but elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also has to deal with continuing tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where members of the majority of Muslims have developed more conservative religious practices.
Over 1,000 people died, and tens of thousands had to leave their homes when the gang of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets by means of areas, bows, arrows, and other original weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool player, equal to Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing against Chelsea in the prime department by challengeing in an 89 - minute game of Saturday at the Stamford Bridge stadium in London.
Sturridge received a transmission from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's target when his team was under 1-0.
He rolled the ball to the left and then tried to shoot towards the far end.
The ball flew high above the target and toward its right corner.
The ball eventually went over the Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumped up, and into the net.
“I just wanted to try to get into this position, to catch the ball, and players like Shaq play him always as long as possible so I tried to create myself as much time as I could,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come and touched one time and didn’t think so much about it, but I just took the shot.”
Chelsea was over 1-0 in half after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in 25 minutes.
In the session, the Chelsea visitor gave the ball his heels to Mateo Kovacic and then spread from the center to the game half Liverpool.
Kovacic made the ball walk quickly between the middle.
Then he sent the ball forward beautifully and sent Hazard in for a visit.
Hazard ran off defenders and scored his left foot shot at Alisson Becker, Liverpool's target.
Liverpool is at Napoli’s front desk at 15:00 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo stadium in Napoli, Italy.
Chelsea is playing against Videoton in the UEFA European Division at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths increases to 832 after a flood in Indonesia
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832 as reported by the country’s disaster organization early on Sunday.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, director of the Agency, said at a press conference that a number of people had been buried in the earthquake that occurred on Friday and was 7.5 points on the Richter scale.

A murder study has been started after a woman’s body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44 - year - old girl found at 7:55 this morning near Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32 - year - old man was arrested suspected of murder.

An investigator, Brian O'Hagan, said: “The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask all those who were in the vicinity of John Street, Birkenhead, to contact us if they could see or hear something suspicious.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially a cab driver, who might have reached something with his car cameras to contact us, because they might have important information for our investigation."
The police spokesperson has confirmed that the woman who died lived in Birkenhead and that she was found in an apartment.
In the afternoon, people who thought they knew the woman have come to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police say that they are working to let the victim’s immediate relatives know.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one could come into the building or leave it.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.

Anyone who might have any information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101, or contact the Crime Line by phone 0800 555 111 and give up number 247 from 30 September.
The statue of the British Congress of Cromwell is the latest monument that is accused of “rewriting the story”
The ban of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban destruction of his violent Puritan followers on so many cultural and religious deities of England.
However, the Cromwell community said that Mr. Crick's suggestion is "poor" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the debate about removing statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell, outside the Westminster Palace, would be before the battle.
Andof the English Civil War against cultural symbols was not the order or execution of Cromwells.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of Thomas his forefather in the first century C.E.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, a magnificent statue of Cromwell, is a mark of the 19th - century menopause and is part of a history that many believe that still deserves praise.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is counted by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, has been the protector of the Congress against external pressure, in his case the kingdom.
The fact that this description is entirely correct is still a historical issue.
However, it is certain that the conflicts in the mid - 17th century have shaped the development of our nation and that Cromwell is a known person representing one side of their conflict.
It is worth giving tribute and remembering his achievements as a guardian of the kingdom."
Pigs attack a Chinese farmer and kill him
Pigs attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him on the market in southwestern China, according to local news.
The man named only by his last name “Yuan” was found dead with a broken artery and covered with blood near the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou County, according to reports from South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccine into pigs in a pig animal on 30 May, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to him, he had traveled with his uncle from neighboring town of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his uncle found him dead and saw that the door into a nearby pig shop was open.
He said that the inside of the decade was a big bulwark with a bloody mouth.
According to the report, a judicial investigation confirmed that the 250 kg gild had killed the farmer.
“ My uncle’s feet were bloody and wounded, ” the uncle said, with the last name “Wu,” to Guiyang Evening News News News.
A security camera recording Yuan showed him to come to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not in Yuan's possession or his cousin's possession.
The owner of the market told Evening News that the pig was locked in so that no one else was attacked while the police collected evidence in the field.
According to news, Yuan’s family and the owners of the market have discussions about compensations for his death.
There are written examples of pigs attacking people, although they are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and seriously injured the man.
Ten years earlier, 300 kg of pigs hugged a wealthy farmer by a tractor until his wife swept the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that their blood taste can arouse aggression.
“ They’re just playing.
They want to whistle and they're curious... they don't want to hurt anybody.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
The remnant of Pharaoh’s hurricane bring a great deal of revenue to the southwest of the United States
As foretold, the concentration of the hurricane Rosa is decreasing as it crosses the cooler sea on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will produce a great deal of resources that could cause floods in the north of Mexico and in the southwest of the United States in the following days.
Rosa became a hurricane in class 1, with wind at 136 km an hour, at 5 o’clock in the morning to an easterly time on Sunday, and he was located over 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to go north on Sunday.
At the same time, the landscape of the Pacific Ocean is reduced, and it will go east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa arrives at the Baja California shaft on Monday as a tropical storm, it will follow a large tropical storm northward into the southwest of the United States.
A rose will follow up to 25 cm of its discharge in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical storm will be mixed with the nearer, vast and far - reaching rainfall over the southwest in the next days.
Local, 2.5 to 10 cm [10 cm] may result in dangerous floods, soil movement, and possible creeping in the desert.
A large tropical storm will cause up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation per hour in some locations, especially in the southern part of Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in the majority of Arizona capsules.
Rapid floods are possible because of the distribution of tropical rain.
People are strongly advised against walking into the desert when there is a risk of tropical rain.
A lot of rain can turn gilds into a clandestine river, and thunderstorms can cause storms of dust and dust.
The approaching product will carry local spillage in certain regions on the South California coast line.
There is a possibility of more than 1 cm of precipitation that could cause minor movement on soil and halo on roads.
This is the first time in the rain season.
A few scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the waste spreads over a larger area late on Monday and Tuesday.
A great deal of output will spread across four states on Tuesday and last out Wednesday.
High temperatures can be expected in all parts of the United States of America, as the Arctic region cools, but the tropical zone remains quite warm.
Sometimes this can cause extreme temperature fluctuations over short distances.
There was a very good example of heat exchange in the United States on Sunday.
There's almost a 7 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the next few days, persistent summertimes will try to build up and disperse again.
A large proportion of the central and eastern parts of the United States are expected to have a warm start in October with temperatures of about 25 degrees or more from the plains in the south to the north-east.
Heat could go up to 25 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees higher than the average.
Our long - term weather forecast indicates that there is a high probability of temperature above average for the east of the United States during the early October.
Over 20 million people watched hearings over Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people looked at the exciting testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court judge, on Tuesday, and the witness to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual crimes that were to take place in the '90s, and the testimony was sent out on six different channels.
At the same time, the political chatter continued and TV stations interrupted the regular schedule to publish the latest news on Friday: Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona presented a bill to the FBI to investigate the charges for one week.
Ford told the E DA that she was confident that Kavanaugh had suffocated her and tried to undress her at a school party.
Kavanaugh, in an emotional testimony, said that he was confident that this did not happen.
It is likely that more people have watched the trial than the 20.4 million that Nielsen reported on Friday.
The company measured average viewing of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC television channels.
Statistics were not available immediately for other television channels showing the hearings, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen is also usually in trouble with measuring people’s views in offices.
To put this in context, this audience is similar in size to football or the Oscar Prize Festival.
According to Nielsen, most of the hearings that took all day saw Fox News Channel or 5,69 million.
ABC was second place with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the trial, interest continued.
Flake was the center of the halos on Friday.
After the council of this Republican Congressman, announcing that he would vote for Kavanaugh, the winners of CNN and CBS received pictures of the protesters calling him on Friday morning, as he tried to enter an elevator to get to a meeting with the judicial committee.
He stood down for a few minutes while soon raining over him in a live broadcast at CNN.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you."
“ Do you think he’s telling the countrymen the truth? ”
People said to him: “You have authority while so many women stand powerless. ”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator doors closed, he said that he would express himself at the committee’s meeting.
Kapal and TV stations all had a live broadcast later when the judicial committee asked whether Kavanaugh's appointment should be sent to the Senate for election.
Flake said that he would do so only if the FBI examined the charges against the committee next week, but a minority of Democrats have encouraged it.
Flake was convinced in part after a conversation with his friend Chris Coons, the senator of Democrats.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and some other senators thereafter.
It was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the study.
President Trump has authorized an investigation by the FBI on the charges against Kavanaugh.
May, British Prime Minister, accuses critics of “being in political play” on the basis of Brxit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Theresa May, the prime minister, critics of its plan to remove the European Union, accused of “being in political play” for the future of Britain and undermining its interests.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of Britain, comes to the conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview published next to her interview on the cover page, Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, agreed that the so-called Chequers programme on Brxit and said that the suggestion that Britain and the European Union should charge customs to each other would be a “excessive dissatisfaction”.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpsons in connection with the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested one suspect for the death of Wayde Sims in a fatal shooting, and he was a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
The 20 - year - old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for a second - degree murder charge, according to the Baton Rouge police.
The authorities released a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson and said that Sims lost his glasses in the air.
Police found the glasses on the scene and claimed that they had been regeneratively discovered by the WAFB’s sister CBS.
The police say Simpson confessed to hearings that he shot Wayde and killed him.
According to his lawyer, a guarantee was made for a total of $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Office of Justice published an interim report on Friday saying that the cause of death is a gunshot in the head and neck.
The authorities wanted to thank the police department in Louisiana, the police crime lab, the police at South University University, and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Allava, president of LSU sports, thanked law enforcement officials for “their splendor and search for justice. ”
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall, two - foot - wide front wing grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He scored 5.6 points on average and took 2.6 rebounds for each game during the last play.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, a basketball coach LSU, said that the team was "happy" and "at fault" because of Wayde's death.
“ It’s something you’re worried about all the time, ” Wade said.
Mount Mount spouts ashes over the city of Mexico
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention in the United States, on Saturday, recommended that the Mexicans stay away from the volcano after an increase in activity, and 183 cases of gas and ash disposal were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center watched shaking and shaking from the volcano.
Photographs from the social media showed a thin layer of ashes on car windows in the Gulf of Mexico, such as Xochimilco.
Earth physiologists have noticed increased activity in the volcano, 72 miles [72 km] east of the capital city, from an earthquake of 7.1 on Richter headed across the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been activated since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatist just before the birthday of a vote of independence
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independent Protestants accepted an ominous police force, and thousands took part in protests on the first birthday of the controversial election in Catalonia to declare independence.
A group of masked separatists stoned an egglike rule and threw a powder paint that formed dark dust on the streets, which was usually filled with tourists.
A conflict also broke out later the other day, and the police used bats to keep fighters in check.
The groups of separatists shouted, “We don’t forget and don’t forgive” for a few hours while their opponents shouted against, “Long live the Spain. ”
Fourteen people needed attention because of minor injuries that they suffered in protests, according to the local media.
Great tension continues in the autonomous territory one year after the national vote on October 1st was judged illegal by the Madrid authorities, but was welcomed by the Catalan divorcing.
The majority of voters chose independence, but participation was poor, since most of those who opposed separation ignored the election.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people last year were injured when the police tried to stop the election at the polls across the territory, which had a conflict.
On Friday, a group of independenceists had stayed out of office to prevent protests in support of the country’s police.
The campaign went on, but it was forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes, 68 - year - old electrician, took part in the protest against divorce with his wife and said that he was no longer hopeful that Catalonia would gain independence.
“ Last year, we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy in being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved the necessary but limited victory in regional polls in December last year, Catalonia’s autonomous groups have had a difficult time keeping steam this year, since many of the most famous leaders are either in a voluntary exile or in detention for their role in the organization of the vote and the independence declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old robot who took the protest in support of the police, said that the politicians of both states had encouraged the dispute.
“ The pen keeps increasing, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison for trial from late last year, announced that he would submit to the European Council next year.
“In the middle of the European elections, ” he said, “the best way to condemn the resurgence of democratic values and oppression that we have seen in the Spanish government is by means of it.

Menage scores in 1-0 victories of Livingston against Rangers
The First Mark of Dolly Menga guaranteed the victory of Livingston
The Livingston team, which came from the bottom section, came to Rangers and Steven Gerrard had to face another loss in 18 games as the CEO of the Ibrox team.
Mark Dolly Menga made the guess, and Gary Holt's team is now in second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team has not yet worked on the field in the premier department this season, and is playing against Hearts, which is eight points ahead of the top, the next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna in the European Union on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston is still undefeated in the department with six victories, and Holt's chief trainer has not yet had to experience losses since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston Losing Devices Against Bitless Visitors
Holt’s team should have been over a long time before it scored its goal, but their ossification caused Rangers great trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then pushed by after passing through the defense to receive a bald transmission from Graig Halkett across the market.
The guests made Rangers play in front of them calmly, knowing that they could cause the guests trouble in the right places.
And that is how the goal was more important.
The Rangers got extra kicks, and Livingston worked to create a target tool. Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga in a pool, which took a shipment and cut from the centers of the suite.
At that point, Rangers had ruled the ball, but local defenders were incorruptible, and Liam Kelly, a goalkeeper, did not have to exert much effort.
So this continued into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos was able to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by Allan McGregor's goalman Rangers, and Lithgow shot from the target after a visit from Livingston.
Askings were constantly in Livingston's victories but were kicked off, and two requirements for a guitar-after-the-defence of Halkett against the vice-man Glenn Middleton, and one by hand-was dismissed.
"Nice" to Livingston Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland reporter at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A beautiful performance and a final for Livingston.
For a normal person, they stood up wonderfully and continued to overcome all expectations of their way of life.
Their styles and their team members have hardly changed anything since they returned to the highest department, but Holt deserves much commendation for having kissed the team together since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, the leader was very good and led a full-scale defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worral on his toes all the time.
On the other hand, Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they have been under Gerrard’s rule, they played far under expectations.
They failed to finish their visits, and only once managed to open the election half of the locals, so this should be a wake - up call for Rangers sitting in the middle of the department.
Erdogan gets blinded receptions in Cologne
It was smiled and bright on Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan’s visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the two NATO countries.
There have been differences between them in matters such as human rights, freedom of the media and the entry of Turkey into the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open up a new, huge Mosque.
The city is home to most Turkish people without Turkey itself.
The police used security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters were in her neighborhood to see their president.
Hundred Protestants against Erdogan - many of them Kurdar - also heard and condemned both Erdogan’s policy and Germany’s decision to invite him to the country.
The two Protestant groups reflect how divided this guest is, but it is hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and hated by others as a dictator.
Conflict in Deptford: A driver killed himself in a collision with a car
In London, a car driver died of a collision.
The collision was near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is an enlarged street in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, about 10.15 p.m. to the British time.
The driver of the car stopped, and the paramedics had an emergency, but the man died at an accident site.
The crash occurred several months after another bicycle driver killed himself in a collision where a driver drove off on Childers Street, 1.5 km from Saturday’s accident site.
The police said that she was working to identify the man and let his closest people know.

Long Lartin Prison: Six Beresses Hurred
Six jailers were injured when an accident broke out in prison for men, as reported by a prison agency.
In Long Lartin of Worcestershire, about 9:30 a.m., the British time on Sunday and still rushing.
"Torando" special units have been called into the area to try to contain the eight prisoners involved and are only in one of the prisons.
The guards received attention because of minor damage to the face of the scene.
“ Specialised prison guards have been called out to deal with cases in the Long Lartin prison, ” said one prison spokesperson.
Six employees have been arrested for injury.
There is no violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that the responsible men will be handed over to the police and may expect to spend even more time behind bars."
Over 500 prisoners sit in Long Lartin’s prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the chief of the prison had to go to the hospital after a prisoner attacked him.
And in October of last year, an unruly police officer was called to deal with a serious disorder of peace, where billion - dollar personnel were attacked.
The hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with rapid floods (dry areas may benefit from this)
It is rare for the tropical region to cross Arizona, but it is likely that it will be early next week when the remains of the hurricane Rosa pass across the southwest, with the risk of rapid floods.
The country’s weather office has already issued warnings for rapid floods before Monday and Tuesday in the west of Arizona and the southern and west parts of Nevada, the south-east of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to cross Phoenix on Tuesday and come late on Monday with an outcome.
On Twitter, the Phoenix Weather Office said that only “ten hurricanes have managed to maintain their strength to become tropical storms or dams in less than 200 miles [320 km] away from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 60 miles of the Arizona border."
Last predictions from the hurricane center of the country predict the 5-10 cm loss, with a single discharge of up to 15 cm in Mogolon Rim, Arizona.
It is likely that in other parts of the southwest, including the center of the Great Mountains and the Great Lakes (The Great Basin), there will be a possibility of individual losses of up to 10 cm.
For those who are not in danger of falling into rapid floods, the outcome of Rosa may be a blessing, for there are great droughts in the area.
Although a flood can cause great damage, some of this result will have a positive effect, as drought is now in the southwest.
According to the United States Drying Authority, there is at least a very large drought in over 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second highest class," according to the news from weather.com.
First, the hurricane Rosa will land on the Baja California shaft in Mexico.
Rosa was still classified as a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind intensity of 136 km per hour and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north at a speed of 19 km per hour.
The storm crosses the cooler sea in the Pacific Ocean, and so its power decreases.
So he is expected to land in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday or Monday evening.
There is a high potential for disposal in some Mexican regions, with a considerable risk of floods.
“There is an increase of up to 5 to 15 cm in Baja California and into the northwest of Sonora, with a possibility of up to 25 cm outage,” reportedweather.com.
Rosa will then pass north over Mexico, as a tropical storm, and then reach the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical region, and then continue up through Arizona and come to the southern part of Utah late on Tuesday night.
“ The ultimate danger expected from Rosa or its remains is very high in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora, and in the southwest of the desert area of the United States, ” said the hurricane center of the country.
These results are expected to cause life - threatening floods and earth’s movement in the wilderness, and they are to be crawled into the mountains.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests due to murder
Three teenagers and a 20 - year - old man have been arrested for a murder attempt, after a 16 - year - old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The youth was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsome Norton, about 0400 a.m. at a British time on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital where his condition is said to be “steady. ”
One 17 - year - old boy, two 18 - year - olds and one 20 - year - olds were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to the police from Avon and Somerset.
The police have been asking witnesses who could have telephone recordings of what happened.
Trump says that Kavanaugh “fell the evil and anger” from the Democratic Party
“Religatory to the support of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the unmerciful and deplorable methods of the Democratic Party,” said Trump at a meeting with the supporters of Wheeling, West Virginia State.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “fell the evil and anger ” from the Democratic Party throughout his process of appointment.
Kavanaugh testified to the council on Thursday, harshly denouncing the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford that he attacked her sexually several decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also witnessed to the committee his accusations.
On Saturday, the president said that “The Americans had seen the genius and diversity and courage of Kavanaughs the other day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote confirming one of the smartest lawyers of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record as a public employee,” he said to a group of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh’s appointment when he spoke of the importance of the Republican supporters’ involvement in the mid - period meetings.
“ It is five weeks in one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not offering myself, but I'm really doing it," he said.
"That's why I'm going across the street to fight for great candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats were working on “teaching and blocking. ”
The first key vote of the Elders' Department of Education on Kavanaugh's appointment should take place no later than Friday, according to the head of the Republican leaders in the interview with CNN.
Hundreds died after an earthquake and a tsunami in Indonesia, and likely the number of the dead will rise
At least 384 died, and many were washed away as vast waves were on the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami ran over the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered together at a festival on the beach of the city of Pala on Friday when up to six feet [6 m] high waves were on the beach by sunset, a number of people washed out into the sea, destroying all that happened to them.
The flood wave was formed by an earthquake of 7.5 points in Richter.
“ When the tsunami was formed yesterday, people were still on the beach, not fleeing immediately, so they died, ” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a speaker of Indonesia’s Disaster Institute, at an information meeting in Jakarta.
“ The storm didn’t come alone, she pulled cars, a wooden drum, a house, and it hit on all the land, ” Nugroho said, adding that the flood wave had traveled over the open sea at 800 miles [800 km] before it hit on the beach.
Some climbed into a tree to escape the tide and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were moved to 24 centers in Pala.
Photographs from the air published by the Disaster Institute showed many ruined buildings and shops, turned, and useless bridges, as well as mosquitoes surrounded by water.
Afterterrors continued to ride the beach city on Saturday.
The number of earthquakes occurred in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
In Indonesia’s Food and Technology Agency stated that the energy released from the big quake on Friday would have been about 200 times higher than that of the atom bomb that fell on the city of Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city lying at the end of a long and narrow flood may have increased the size of the tsunami, said the institute.
Nugroho said the damage was “real” and that thousands of houses, hospitals, malls, and hotels had crashed.
The body of several victims was found trapped under a crash of fallen buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured, and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the loss and damage to property could be greater along the coast line 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongila, which is near the roof of the earthquake.
Communication “is completely down, and no information is received ” from Dongila, Nugroho said.
“ Over 300,000 people live there, ” said the Red Cross in a declaration, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the respective region.
“ It is already a tragedy, but it may be much worse, ” said the Red Cross.
The Agency was criticized by many on Saturday for not telling us that a tsunami had tsunamis at Pala, although public representatives said that the waves had arrived within the time of the warning.
In a video published on the social media, a man could hear a cry from the upper floor of a building to warn the people on the street below that a tsunami was approaching.
Only minutes later, the tsunami beats the beach and carries out buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the video right away.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a lack of electricity that hindered the communication with Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to organize relief work.
The military is starting to send aircraft with relief from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but people who have been helped by the territory still need to be very much involved in food and other needs.
The city’s airport has only been reopened for relief activities and will be closed to October.
Joko Widodo, President of the United States, is going to visit a Pau refugee center on Sunday.
The number of deaths exceeds 800 after a tsunami in Indonesia.
Things are very bad.
The servants of World Vision from Dongula have taken the whole and the vessels to the city of Palu, where they seek shelter in tent cities that were set up in the garden outside their offices. The destruction of the animals was on their way, according to Mr. Dosaba.
“ People said they saw a lot of houses destroyed, ” he said.
Things are very bad.
Help force groups have begun hard work, but some have complained that foreign relief workers with extensive expertise have been prevented from travelling to Pala.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies, and personnel can only begin to arrive if the disaster area is declared an area of disaster.
It hasn't been done yet.
“ It’s still a local disaster scene, ” said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared this an area of disaster, we can open up for foreign aid, but no statement has yet come."
When the second night fell upon Pala after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, friends and families of those who are still missing kept in hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracle stories that cast the blasphemy of the devastating headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a start.
On Sunday, relief workers saved a woman who had been trapped under ruins for two days with her mother’s body beside her.
Gendon Subandano, now missing for the Asian Games that ended earlier in that month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mr. Monday.
“As a man with a long experience in hovering, I have my own emotional burden to bear, ” he said.
Mr. Gendon reported that the hour after the news was received within the hover group because the Roa Roa Hotel fell, he had sent whatsApp messages in despair to the Keppends who stayed in Pala and participated in the beach festival.
His message, however, showed only a grey mark, instead of a bluer one.
“I think the message was not received, ” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 when filling up a fast bank in Newport on the Liver
On Friday morning, thieves robbed $26,750 from Brink’s employee, who was filling up a fast - moving bank in Newport on the Year, according to a report from the Newport police.
The driver of the car had been emptying a fast bank in the entertainment area and was about to fill in more money on him, said Dennis McCarthy, police officer, in the announcement.
When he was working, another man came to “the rear of Brink’s employee, ” stealing a bag of money for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects flee from the scene, according to the announcement, but police did not report how many were involved.
Those who might have information about the suspects are asked to contact the Newport Police Department by telephone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes its name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name - in Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, and he wrote, "The thing that was previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the name as the title of the eighth album that came out in June.
The change is due to his participation in the Saturday Night Live program, where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grandi on the show, but she stopped for “emotional reasons, ” said the producer.
West has previously said that this name has a religious meaning for him, but it is also a abbreviation for his current name.
“I believe that “ye” (you) is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means“ you, ” said West earlier this year when he spoke about the name on his record with the radio director Big Boy.
“ So I am you, I am us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the one, and to just Ye--to be just a reflection of the good in us, the evil, the confused, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are."
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former colleague of West, has also written his name both with and without a band stitch and capital.
The core president of Mexico promises not to use the army against public cities
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against public citizens, now that the country will soon remember the 50th birthday of bloody vengeful students.
On Saturday at the Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised to “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people. ”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot at peaceful protests in the public square and killed up to 300 people when the left - hand movements of students were taking root in all Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico by providing all students with monthly strength and opening up more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational facilities attract young people to gangsters.
The United States should double its initial resources
Now that China is increasingly active in the use of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount of money it spends in research in this field, says the inventor and artificial intelligence user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
They were told that various U.S. government departments issued reports on artificial intelligence, even though the United States has no formal global satellite intelligence programme.
However, China announced its plan last year: it aims to be first in creation with artificial intelligence before 2030.
“ It would be a good start to double the amount of money that goes into artificial analysis, given that all other countries are so much further behind the United States, and we are waiting to see the next major discovery in the field of artificial intelligence, ” said Lee.
Dualisation of funding could double the chances that the next major discovery will be made in the United States, Lee told the CNBC to interview this week.
Lee, the author of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month by the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the head of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the leading satellite companies in China.
He worked in an artificial analysis system during the '90s of Carnegie Mellon University, who won the best player in Othello, and later he was the manager of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese department at Google.
Lee spoke of the first US - based technology competitions, such as the defence robotics competition, and asked when the next race would be held, to detect the next beginners.
Scientists in the United States often have to work hard to get the strength of the government, says Lee.
“ It’s not China that grabs its main minds, but the companies, ” Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired geniuses from colleges to work with artificial technology in the last few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen their artificial intelligence research.
“I feel that those who have a doctoral degree should be given an automatic residence permit,” he said.
The Council of China published its future-specific plan in July 2017.
China’s National Science Foundation, like the National Science Foundation, does, in the United States, provide funds to those who work at university institutions, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China, says Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defence Department set up an artificial intelligence centre, which is designed to work together with both industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the development of a special satellite intelligence committee.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it invests over $100 million annually in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the U.S. Law that was designed to establish a satellite safety council has been unable to continue for many months.
The Macedonians vote in the referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia chose to vote on Sunday on the question of whether the name of the country should be changed in the 'Norwegian-Macedonia' Republic in an attempt to resolve decades of conflict with Greece, which has closed their application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece is a region known as Macedonia and claims that its northern neighbours are equivalent to the requirement of their territory and therefore refused entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June, based on the new name, but nationalistic opponents argue that the change will undermine the self - image of the majority of Macedonian people.
Mr Ivanov, President-in-Office of the Council, has said that he will not participate in the vote and campaign to ignore it has raised doubts that participation reaches the 50 percent minimum required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the voting order is this: “Do you want to go to NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?”
The supporters of the change in names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that this is a reasonable price for Macedonia to be included in alliances such as the EU and NATO, one of which was formed after Yugoslavia’s fall.
“I came today to choose the future of the country for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgian, 79, in Skopje.
Although the conclusion is not legally binding, many senators have said that they will follow it and bind it into law.
The change of name would require approval of two thirds of the Parliament.
The election committee said that nothing unusual was reported at 1 o’clock after noon.
However, compared with 34 per cent participation in last Congress in 2016, the participation was only 16 per cent, when 66 per cent of the votes were voted by the registered voters.
“I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62 - year - old in the capital city of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, took his vote in the Macedonian referendum on whether to change the name of the country, which would give its way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the council in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, won to prepare a small field and set up a seat in front of tents built by those who will ignore the vote.
“We’re covered with NATO and the EU, but we want to become members with our heads high, not going through the service doors,” said Kavardarkov.
“ We are a poor land, but we have a dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn around like China or Russia and become part of the Eurasian relationship."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO will provide the necessary funding to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
“I believe that the vast majority will agree that more than 80 percent of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” said Zaev after paying her vote.
He said that approval would be “confirmation of our future. ”
A survey published on Monday from the Macedonian Policy Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would participate in the national vote, which is lower than the minimum required.
Another survey from the TV channel Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents were willing to take their vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they were going to say yes.
In order for the national vote to be valid, attendance must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote is not approved, this could mean the first serious impact on the government’s policy supported by the West from May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, player Manchester City, goes through all the defenses of Brighton and scorers
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling went lightly with Brighton's defense in the victory of Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he cut his target at 65 minutes.
The Argentinan advance received a shipment in the middle of the field at the beginning of the visit.
He spread past the three Brighton defenders and then went out to the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green - colored defenders.
He passed by one defender and then ran away a few more people just like Brighton's victories.
Then he sent to the left, and found Sterling.
The English advance used the first contact within the suite to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to play at Mathew Ryan, Brighton, with a shot at the right side of the target.
“Aguero has some foot problems,” said Pep Guardiola, City Executive, to the reporters.
“ We talked about it playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then this happened.
We were lucky that he scored a target at this moment."
But it was Sterling who gave them the blue first goal in the final game.
That target came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received a transmission far inside Brighton's whale half in that pursuit.
He sent a magnificent long ball on the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball several times and then sent to Sterling towards the far end.
By the way, City sent the ball to the net just before it ran out.
City is playing against Hoffenheim in the Master's Department at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a playoff against Rockies
Since national teams have been excluded from playing in the finals, there was no reason to force another beginning.
But the brave Scherzer hopes to throw on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies are still able to make it to the finals, but they have one game advance over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West.
Rockies got at least a wildcard seat with her 5-2 victories at Nationals on Friday night, but the team still strives to reach their first section.
“ Even if we play for free, we can at least play for an electric atmosphere in Denver, as well as the one that the other team is sure to play their best game this year.
Why shouldn't I want to compete in such situations?"
Nationals are still to announce who will be the first caster in Sunday’s game, but they are expected to let Scherzer throw in these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was about to start a game for 34th, took a training course on Thursday and would throw it on a Sunday, which is his usual Sabbath.
This right - handed thrower in Washington is 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 winds in 220 2/3 rounds during this season.
Trump Visits West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the case around Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court judge, when he spoke of the importance of the role of Republican supporters in the middle - season concerts.
“ Everything is at stake in November.
It is five weeks in one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the great, big... I don't bid myself forward, but it does, however, because I'm going across the field to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, saying: “You can see this terrible, radical group of democrats, you can see that happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, you see the cruelness, the evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go to get authority and government, they just want power and government, we don't give it to them.
He said that the Democrats were working on “teaching and inhibiting. ”
“ And it has been seen in the last four days, ” he said, saying the Democrats, “be wrathful and cruel and cruel. ”
He named the Senator Diane Feinstein, the director of the Democrats of the Electoral Committee, on a name basis, and was answered by a loud bell from the audience.
“ Remember her answer?
Were you the one who worked the document?
Ha, what?
No, no, no, I waited in one... it was really a bad body expression, the worst I've ever seen."
The workers' party is no longer an accomplice.
He endures none of those who express their minds
When the operative Momentum, in my class, chose to charge me, it was hardly surprising.
After all, I am the last of many members of the Labour Forces who have been told that we are not welcome, just for expressing our minds.
Joan Ryan, my co-chairman, received similar treatment because she protested harsh prejudices against Jews.
In my case, the suggestion to refer me was because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues were the importance of having responsible economic policies, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy was disagreed with previous leaders.
The Notice of the Meeting for Nottingham East on Friday said that “we want the meetings to understand no beyond and to be successful.”
During my eight - year career as a member of the labour force, Friday meetings have often been just that.
Sadly, it is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of “milder and better” politics has been forgotten if it ever began.
It has become increasingly apparent that different opinions are not in the Workers’ Party and that all opinions are judged according to whether or not the group’s leaders consider them acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues, whom I thought before, had similar political views to those of me, began to expect me to take a complete turn and support opinions that I had never had previously agreed, whether in terms of national security or in terms of the common EU market area.
Every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't matter what I say - it follows that the disgrace on the social media is called for my exclusion, central government denied, and I said that I shouldn't be in the Workers' Party.
And this isn't just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, since most of the comments I get to me are usually political.
I admire professionalism and the confirmation of those who have to endure the hollowness of sexual or prejudiced insults every day but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing things in this political period is how attacks and insults have become a natural part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Workers' Party should be in a position to support culture.
The reality is that we are no longer an accomplice church, and with each distrust policy or change in the rules of choice, the class becomes increasingly tight.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years to keep my head down, not to be too high, and then I would be “all right. ”
But I decided not to share in politics to do so.
Since I became a member of the Workers' Party as a student 32 years ago, motivated by the neglect of the government of Thatcher, who left my schoolhouse in the département, I have fought for better public service for those who need it the most, whether I was in town or in town.
I've never given up my political opinions, nor at my last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my orientations and where I disagree with current leaders.
With those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would just like to say that when the country is heading to Brxit, who will harm home, business and our public service, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Workers' Party.
But my only message, which I would like to send from me, is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to those who are within my domain, whether they are members of the Workers' Party or not: I serve you with pride, and I promise that no threat of deviation or political exclusion will detract me from doing what I consider to be for the best of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated team Ayr goes to the top
Two late touch limits may have skewed the final results, but there is no doubt that Ayr had the victory left in this acutely fun game of the day in the Tentent's Premiership department.
They are now at the top of the list, and the only team of ten still undefeated.
Finally, their protection was stronger and better use in facilities that made the home conqueror more successful, and Peter Murchie's coach had the right to be happy.
“ We’ve had a hard opposition in our games so far and still undefeated, so I’ve got to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Says of commendation, they took advantage of their opportunities better than we did,”
Mark Grant Anderson came across Ayr in 14 minutes after Frazier Climo turned the attendance, but a yellow card on the Scottish leader, who was allowed to play the game with Warriors, enabled Melrose to let the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot got to score touchdown.
Climo increased Ayr’s headship by hell before he scored with a kick just before half the game and then touched the touchdown and came Ayr over 17-5 in a half.
However, Melrose began a second half of his strength and touched Patrick Anderson, after Baggot turned the search, reduced the target to five points.
Then a long break had to be made in order to cope with serious injuries at Ruaridh Knott, who had to carry off the playground, and thereafter Ayr still increased his lead with a touchtimer from Staffford McDonald, after Climo turned the show.
Blair Macpherson, head of Ayr, then got the yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of being a man over with a touch-timer from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a hard search.
On the other hand, the locals returned strongly and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for using Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored the touchmark behind the Ayr search, after the extra kick.
Climo turned the search to, as he did again immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe reached kick David Amrstrong from the suite and sent to Gregor Henry, who cut the team's fifth touch mark.
Star of the Still Game items ready for a new career in the restaurant
Ford Kieran, the star of the Set Game elements, seems ready to move to the restaurant crash after he discovered that he was appointed manager of the restaurant company.
Kieran, 56 years old, plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC show, a popular piece he writes and plays in along with his old partner from the entertainment industry, Creg Hemphill.
The duke has announced that the expected ninth series will be the last one, and it seems Kiernan has plans for the life of Craiglong.
According to the official files, he's the manager of Akfmorn Limited.
The actor wanted nothing to say about the story, but the author Scottish Sun insisted that Kiernan be involved in a “living restaurant club” Glasgow city.
"The sea is ours": the land of Bolivia without a beach hope that a court will open its way again to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors watch the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
General buildings flag blue flags.
Navy stations from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are marked with the slogan: “We have a right to the sea.
It's our duty to recover it."
On the other hand, throughout all the land - closed Bolivian heritage of the 19th - century, lost to Chile in bloody conflicts, along with the desire to sail through the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes may be the strongest for decades, now that Bolivia awaits rulings from the International Court of Justice in The Hague on October 1, five years later, the International Court of Justice decides.
“ Bolivia has the power, the uniting spirit, and the unrest, and, of course, awaits the positive decision, ” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many of the people of Bolivia will observe the International Court’s ruling on large screens all over the country, hoping that the Court of Justice of The Hague will take advantage of the requirement that Chile be required to give Bolivia access to sea after decades of difficult conversation.
The decision on Monday is also of great importance to Evo Morales, the president of the country of Indian origin, who will be in a controversial struggle for reconciliation next year.
“ We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he promised late August.
However, some commentators consider it unlikely that the court would make a decision in favour of Bolivia, and that it would not change much if he did so.
The Court of Justice, which has headquarters in the Netherlands, has no authority to give a country from Chile and has stated that the decision will not affect the outcome of the possible proceedings.
The fact that the decision of the court comes only six months after the final talks indicates that the case “did not have been complicated, ” said Paz Sárate, a Swedish expert in international law.
It is also possible that during the last four years, Bolivia was not for promotion, but if it caused the country to return.
“ Bolivia’s current government has stolen the issue of access to the sea, ” said Zárate.
Morale’s military speech has reduced all favors from Chile, she considered.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to discuss at some point, but it will be very difficult after this.
From 1962 onward, the two countries have not exchanged for embassies.
Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, former President of Bolivia and representative of the country in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision had taken an unusually short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “a unique opportunity to open up a new relationship with Chile, ” and he said,“ to put an end to a conflict of some 139 years back in time, both countries for benefit. ”
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, another of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this issue as a political crutch.
“ Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific, ” he added.
“ It is an opportunity to see that we must recover in the past. ”
North Korea says no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, Foreign Minister North Korea, says that the country will never take down its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
On Saturday, at the United Nations General Assembly, Ri gave his speech.
He called on the United States to follow the promises they made at a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
His comments come now when Mike Pompeo, U.S. Foreign Minister, seems to be about relaunching talks on nuclear weapons, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea.
It says that it is “dreamors” to keep continuing business prayers and protests against the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever break North Korea.
Washington does not want to accept the declaration unless Pyongyang takes first clear action to take down his nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, president of the United States, want to meet again at another meeting.
However, there are considerable doubts that Pyongyang is serious about taking down weapons that the country may view as the only way to ensure safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
Tetanics in Paris introduce the latest line of big headcoats that will come in fashion shops near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or be completely hidden from the sun, you do not need to look further.
Valentino and Thom Browne’s designers showed many strange, oversized hats for their SS19 line on the fashion field that impressed the jethole on the fashion week of Paris.
A number of pictures of the extremely inconvenient worlds have been published on Instagram in the summer, and these designers have had their latest creations to show up in fashion shows.
Valentino’s main work was a large light - brown hat with large bars that resembled feathers and covered the heads of the hips.
Of other upper-sized items, watermelons could be seen, placed in gems, a money hat, and even pineapples, but these things are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced many strange masks, just at the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had smeared lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than a high - fashioned one.
One fertilizer resembled a ventilator with a ventilator and glasses, while another was likened to melted ice in the form of bread.
If you want to go to school in the fashion, you're lucky.
A German expert predicts that the big hats could soon be sold in the fashion stores near you.
Large hats come to the heels of “La Bomba, ” a straw hat with over 60cm large bars that have adorned their heads from Rihanna to Emily Ratakowski.
The tick mark behind the very inconvenient hat, which was seen in all the social media, was inspired by another major accessory that appeared in the fashion field — a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the swimmer's moth that carried it.
The orange ostrich, with strawboards and white leather handle, was the main part of La Riviera SS10’s coat line Jacquemus at the fashion week in Paris.
Luke Armitage, the famous styleist, said in an interview with FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags appear in the fashion shops for the next summer – where the designer has caused such an impact should be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize items.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for citizens of the world
The private schools in Scotland are known for the outstanding achievements of their students, and it has continued in 2018 with new, magnificent test results, which are still strengthened by individual and group achievements in sports, art, music and other social fields.
These schools have up to 30,000 students throughout Scotland, with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools in defense of them, and they strive to give their students and their parents the best possible service.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further study, the career they have chosen, and their position as a citizen of the world.
As a teacher who can put together and teach according to a well - designed curriculum, we see that a new language continues to be a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language that he understands, he will touch his mind.
If you speak to him in his mother's language, he will touch his heart."
This is an important reminder that we cannot just trust in English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s test results show that languages are at the top of the art with the highest proportions of students who pass tests in private schools.
68 percent of students learning foreign languages received excellent A.
The data collected from 74 schools within the SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the fine Spanish A in Mandarin, while 72 percent learned German, 69 percent learned French, and 63 percent of Spanish students also received the grade A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages that will certainly require future skills for young ones and children.
At the moment, languages such as an election are placed in the same place as scientific study material (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in private school and elsewhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that for the reasons given by employers that work was difficult, 17 percent was due to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future work.
Now that more and more jobs require knowledge in languages, this ability is needed in a global world.
No matter what career people choose, they will have a real head start in the future if they learn another language, but it is a knowledge that ends their lives.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will give a weighty person an automatic head start on the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov on over 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent of them could not speak another language well enough to maintain conversation, and French was the only language spoken by two-digit percent, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for modern - day children to invest immediately in language learning.
Diversities, especially in emerging countries, will provide children with a better opportunity to find an important job.
In Scotland, the language they teach varies from school to school.
A certain number of schools will focus on more classical new languages, while others will teach languages that are thought to be the most important for Britain when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interest is, it will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with specialized teachers.
Skeptical private schools commit themselves to offer up a study area, which will prepare children and prepare them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future will bring.
It cannot be denied that at this time, in a global business environment, languages continue to be necessary for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, today’s language should really be regarded as “international skills in communication. ”
Private schools will continue to offer choices, diversity, and excellence for Scotland’s young people.
I'm sure the bee le faire.
John Edwards is the leader of the Scottish Private School Council
LeBron is playing his first game for Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
Soon there will be an end to fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game before Los Angeles Laker.
Luke Walton, Coach Lakers, has announced that James will play on Sunday in the opening game of the season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has not yet been decided how many minutes he will play.
“ It will be longer than one minute and shorter than 48, ” said Walton on Laker’s public website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for Laker, said on Twitter that James would probably play for a limited time.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked in his plans for Laker’s six - game program before the start of the season.
“ During this period of my career, I don’t have to play games before the season to prepare me, ” he said.
Timer for the Trump election meeting in West Virginia and the YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a series of election meetings and the first one is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five organized meetings next week, where he will also stop in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his election of a new Supreme Court judge has been suspended, the Trumpet aims to build up support for the next midterm session, as the Republics are at risk of losing control of the council when the vote is taken in November.
What time is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, and how can you watch it online?
Meeting of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, is due to begin at 7 p.m. at an easterly time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia on the Internet below through a live YouTube broadcast.
It is likely that Trump will appoint the court of Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court judge, who, for the charges of sexual harassment, ruled for tensions, a vote by the Senate to conrm him as a judge for up to a week while the FBI investigates the charges.
However, the main objective of the Trump meetings is to help the Republicans reach a better start, but they await difficult elections in November.
Therefore, the Trump campaign’s message that these five meetings held next week are aimed at “filling volunteers and supporters with enthusiasm is the Republican’s attempt to protect and increase the majority of their members in the Senate and in Congress, ” according to Reuter’s newspaper.
“ The head of the council is so necessary for the President’s plan that he will travel to as many states as possible already a second and second campaign period begins, ” said an unnamed spokesperson from Trump’s campaign at Reuter’s news office.
The meeting tonight will be held at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, and supporters are expected to come from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and that the media from Pittsburgh tell about him,” according to the West Virginia Metro News News News.
The meeting on Saturday will be the second visit of Trump to West Virginia in this month, but he won with more than 40 percent difference in this state in 2016.
Trump wants to try and help Patrick Morrissey, the publisher of the Republicans of West Virginia, to the Senate, who is lower in polls.
“It’s not a good idea for Morrissey that the president has to come and try to increase his popularity,” said Simon Hader, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuter’s newspaper.
Ryder the Bishop 2018: The United States team is showing a willingness to keep hope alive for the individual competition on Sunday
After three one - sided rings, the four that was late on Saturday could be exactly what needed to be done in this race for the Ryder Cup.
Success swings are sports ideas that have been invented and that players truly believe in, and never more than in the race like this.
Where would they say that success now lies?
“ They had six points ahead, and now it’s four points, so that success lies rather on our side now, I guess,” said Jordan Spieth when he set out in the race of the day.
Of course, Europe has its first four points ahead, with another twelve.
The Americans, as Spieth said, consider themselves to have a little wind in the sails and they can be hopeful of many, especially the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each got three points out of four.
Spieth has been quite averse to flattening and leading his example.
As the ring went down, the cheers increased and he set down a vital cushion to shepherd the four points in the game after he and Thomas had been two points below after two games.
His boy, who assured them of his victory in the game of the 15th Hole, had a similar joyful cry, a cry of the kind that tells you that he believes that the American team still has a hope.
“A man has to dive deep and think about his own game, ” said Spieth.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to work in points.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of Ryder's cup.
This strange but fascinating European couple have won four games of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who got schooled on Saturday, but they also managed to avoid schooling on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon, and on the nine - hole field on Friday morning.
That game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the loud audience clearly shows that they are the couple who have to win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to seal the possible victory of the European team than Fleetwood or Molinari, the sun sitting over the Le Golf National Court.
Both would do so at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went lightly with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the quake in the morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
In the first nine holes, the Spaniard and the Svain dug into a hole that they never could scratch.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The four balls and the fours are so exciting to watch closely because of the communication between the couples, their advice, the advice they do not give, and how the playbook can change in one field.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a considerable advance before the end of the day, but these quadruples also showed that America’s people have the will to fight that some had to doubt, especially other Americans.
Europe with 10-6 lead for the final day of the race for the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good start for the last day of the Ryder Cup after four bullets and fours of Saturday, with the pretext of 10-6 against the United States.
The astrologer Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over Tiger Woods, who had difficulties, and had received four points on the Le Golf National Wall.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who would like to regain the prize cup lost on the Hazeltine field two years ago, demonstrated great superiority over the U.S. four - ball team of the morning and won 3 - 1.
The United States showed greater resistance in the fours and won two games than did not win the stairwell.
Jim Fury’s team needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to continue the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who became the nickname “Molliwood” after a wonderful weekend, are only the second couple who win four points from their first four games in the history of Ryder.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the quad - ball game, they showed a great team brain and worked down Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, displayed his genius, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in quads and quads, and seven consecutively.
Justin Rose, who was suspended for the four ball game of the morning, came back to his partner, Henrik Stenson, in the four games, and worked 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are first and third on the list of the best golfers in the world.
However, Europe did not go into the interests of that mild and gentle day southwest of Paris.
Three - year - old winners in the big race in golf, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the target for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They worked with difficulties 2-1 against Jon Rahm from Spain and Ian Poulter in quadruples and later came back and defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the quadrups after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that the team has won up four points at the start of an individual contest, although the Furyk team only needed a draw to continue the cup.
However, after the next two days, they appear to be under attack on Sunday.
North Korea says one-sided disarming "unstable" without trust
On Saturday, Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told S.D. that a continued business prayer was just adjourning their distrust in the United States, and it would be impossible for the country to take down its nuclear weapons on its own in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho, on last year's General Assembly of the United States, said that North Korea had taken “a major measure of goodwill” in the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, taking down the nuclear test area, and promising to risk the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“ On the other hand, we have seen no corresponding reaction from the United States, ” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no guarantee of our country’s security, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to take down our nuclear weapons on our one-sided basis first.”
Although Ri repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to "stacked" nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded for every step of it, his declaration seemed special in that he did not deny one-sided nuclear disarmament cleanly as Pyongyang had done before.
It referred to joint statements by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between Presidents of the United States and North Korean leaders, in Singapore on 12 June, in which Kim promised to “the nuclear disarmament of the Korean scandal” and Trump made a promise to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea has sought solutions to bring a formal end to the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must leave its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax the strict business ban against North Korea.
“ The United States demands that “nuclear disarmament take place first,” and that pressure be increased by using commercial prayers to achieve its achievement, even protesting the declaration of ending the war, ” Ri said.
“ It’s only a dream of people who don’t know about us to think that a business prayer can get us on our knees.
But the problem is that continued business prayer increases our distrust."
There was no mention of plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump, mentioned earlier this week by the leader of the United States.
Instead, the minister spoke of three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, the leader of South Korea during the past five months, adding: “If the party to this nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea instead of the United States, this position on the nuclear disarmament issue on the Korean side would not be the issue.”
In spite of this, the talk by Mr. Ri was very different from his speech last year when he said to the General Assembly that it would be inevitable to direct missiles from North Korea to the US mainland after “the Devilege president” Trump called Kim“ a firefleet” in a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened to destroy North Korea, but this year he praised Kim of the United Nations for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that much work was still going on and that business prayer had to continue until North Korea had destroyed all its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time limit for this, saying: “If this takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia say that the S.D. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Foreign Secretary Mike Pompeo told the Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council's request must continue to apply until complete nuclear disarmament has taken place and is confirmed.”
The Security Council agreed to extend a business request with North Korea from 2006 in an attempt to close down funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile plans.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline of the STH General Assembly and said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that success had been achieved, but only a few hours later, North Korea condemned him for doing “decent demands.”
North Korea promised to meet with Moon this month to take down a fire-fleet area and nuclear station if the United States were to act as a corresponding operation.
He said that Kim told him that the “equivalent actions ” he was looking for were assurances of safety that Trump promised in Singapore and actions aimed at normal relations with Washington.
Students in Harvard take a course at rest
A new course at Harvard University has given all students greater sleep in an effort to resist the increasing tendency of students to stay awake and learn all night with the help of caffeine tablets.
A study revealed that students at the world’s best university often know little or nothing about the basics of thinking about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of hysterical medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and the Women’s Hospital, designed the course and thought it would see the first species in the United States.
He was given the idea of doing the course after conducting a lecture on the impact of insomnia on learning ability.
“ At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and asked, “Why am I told this first now, in my final year? ”
She said that no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he said to Telegraph.
The first study this year explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help learning skills and performance in sports, even contributing to general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of mental medicine at Harvard Medical School and the head of the school’s medical care, said that the university had decided to study the course after learning that students were very sleepless over the week.
The study period is one hour and involves various interactive assignments.
One part contains a picture of a living room, where students click on a cup of coffee, window covers, sports shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sports can worsen in the lack of sleep, as well as the importance of good busin for sleep.
In part, participants are told how long - term sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the school area with interactive signs then encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
“ We know that this will not change the conduct of students immediately.
But we feel that they have the right to know this, just as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that favors those who stay awake and learn all night is still there, he said, and added that modern technology and increased pressure on students meant that sleep shortages were growing problems.
The assurance of getting enough sleep of good quality should be “a secret weapon” for students to defend themselves from stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said — even to avoid fattening, because the lack of sleep increases the brain’s call for food so that the body is hungry.
Raymond So, 19 years old in chemistry and physical biology from California, Professor Czeisler helped put his course together, but he sat one of the professor's cows last year at his first year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a course for all students at school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all the Masters to complete a similar course before they start a university study.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students consider setting an alarm clock, which reminds them to go to sleep, and to wake them up, and take into account the harmful effects from blue light that electronic displays and LED light emit, which can confuse the inner clock of the body and lead to trouble falling to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark from Menga shot down Gerrard's men
Rangers still had trouble on the ground when Stevens Gerrd's broken team had to settle for 1-0 losses on Livingston, by mark from Dolly Menga.
The Ibrox team wanted to win his first victory on the field after his victory on St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team only gave Gerrard's second loss in his 18 games as manager. The team is now eight points after Hearts, which is at the top of Ladbrokes Premiership department.
Menga scored seven minutes before a half - story, and Rangers seemed to lack all inspiration and were never likely to recover.
Rangers now fall to the sixth place, but Livingston goes up to the third, and are only after Hibernian at a target moment.
Rangers might have further problems after the lineman Calum Spence had to receive attention due to head injury after some object was thrown into it from the host half of the guests.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr away and came into the evasive background of the Betfred cup.
Holt, on the other hand, maintained the same Life 11 setup that reached a score of Hearts last week, and he had been pleased with how his well - trained team over the resistance.
Rangers might have had more with the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the ball it reached.
They should have scored just two minutes after the playoff when the first shipment from Menga came Scott Pitman in front of Allans McGregors' mark, but he shot by.
Long extras from Keaghan Jacobs then ended up at Craig Halkett, but Alan Lithgow, his defense partner shot past the front pole.
Rangers regained control of the game but seemed to live rather than believe in their game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morales certainly felt that he should have had a hell when a quarter was over, when he and Steven Lawless were together, but Judge Steven Thomson referred to the Colombian call.
Rangers only got to take two shots to the finish in the first half, but Liam Kelly, the former goalr of Ibrox, did not have to have much to defend the baldness of Lassana Coulibaly and easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although life’s opportunity in 34 minutes had occurred despite the loss of the other team, no one can deny that they deserved it, but not only because of their perseverance.
Rangers failed again to do something from Jacob’s long, extra powers.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his calm and chose to send to Menga, who then challenged easily.
Gerrd took counsel in half, and sent Ryan Kent in instead of Coulibaly, and the shifts had effect as soon as the backguard came in, but Kelly quickly responded and ran forward to close the shot.
Livingston, however, continued to trick the guests into playing the very type of game they enjoy playing, and Lithgow and Halkett reached each long shipment of others.
Holt’s team could have increased its lead in the locusts, but McGregor did well to deny Jacob’s opportunity before Lithgow ran to the corner.
Glenn Middleton, Ranger's janitor, wanted another hell as he and Jacobs fell down, but Thomson referred it back.
Almanak: The man who invented the Geiger counter
Here is a newspaper page from our "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and AFFRAM... This is the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "His" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to study and measure radioactivity and that invention eventually led to a device called Geiger.
Since then, the geiger norm in the science world was also popular in pop culture, for example in the 1950 'Bells of Coronado' film, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in a unlikely role as scientists:
Man: “What the hell is that? ”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger measure, used to find radioactive substances such as uranium.

New cancer vaccine can teach your immune system to “see” dangerous cells
New cancer vaccine can teach your immune system to “see” dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to know dangerous cells as part of the treatment
The treatment includes taking immune cells from the patient and changing them to the laboratory.
Then they can “see” proteins, which are common in many cancer cells, and are then injected back into the patient
Experimental vaccines have shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months, and the vaccine teaches immune cells to recognise dangerous cancer cells.
The procedure involves taking the immune cells from a patient and changing them to a laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2 found in many types of cancer, then the cells are injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the United States’ Cancer Institute in Bethesday, Maryland, said: “Our sites indicate that the vaccine is highly effective.”
HER2 “makes various types of cancer stop growing,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon, said Berzofsky, professor.
A similar procedure in which immune cells are removed from patients and the “identified” to attack cancer cells has been effective in treating one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held a long, simple speech to support Trump and carried a MAGA derhufu after appearing on the TV program SNL.
It didn't end well
On Kanye West, in the studio in Saturday Night Live, after a long talk, he commended the President of the United States' Donald Trump and said that he would invite himself to the President of the United States in 2020.
After moving the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, where he carried the Make America Great derhufu, he spoke long against the democrats and repeated his support to Trump.
“ I’ve talked to white people so often, saying, “How can you like Trump, he’s a race hater? ”
If I were concerned about a racial hatred, I would have long moved from the United States," he said.
SNL began the scene with a pole where Hollywood star Matt Damon made fun of the testimony of Bretts Kavanaugh to the Electoral Committee on the grounds of Christine Blasey Ford’s accusations of sexual harassment.
Although West’s long - term end was not sent out, the recording of it was placed on the social media of Chris Rock’s cognition.
I don't know if Rock wanted to make fun of West by publishing the tape.
Also, West had complained to the audience that he had received bad backstage receptions because of his hat selection.
“ I was put in a back - range monogamy.
They said to me: “Do not go up to the field with this hat. ”
They left me alone!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, according to the news of Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see the deep hole, ” and said that he would put on his superhero robe“ because that means that you can’t appoint me for doing things, and would you like the world to make progress?
Try your love."
His comments were met with a box from the audience at least twice, and SNL’s actors appeared to be most shameful, according to Variety, and one present said to the paper: “There was silence in the studio. ”
West had been invited to join the show instead of the singer Ariana Grande, but her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his field performance when he sang the song I Love it, dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by Candace Turner, who designed the TPUSA conservative class, who said on Twitter: “To one of the bravest souls: DO NOT TAKE TO MAKE THE MOST. ”
But the chat director Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was simply being "he himself and it's absolutely wonderful."
“ But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his “list ”), which I feel is supporting and spreading ideas that are harmful to my community.
He's free.
That's us too," she added.
For the show, Twitter's rapist announced that he changed his name and said that he was now "the man who was previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion, and should not be forgotten the music legend Prince’s vow, who changed his name in symbol and later called himself the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Charge for attempted murder after a knife attack at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45 - year - old has been accused of attempted murder after being stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Tuesday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The accused person is expected to attend a courtroom in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutor will pass the charges.
Kit Harington, the star of the Crown Games, criticises poisonous masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent adventures from the HBO, the Crown Games.
However, the actor, 31 years old, has criticized the standard picture of the male hero and says that such a role on the screen is often felt by young boys that they need to be tough to gain respect.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes that “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic maleity during the #MeToo period.
Kit, who recently married her concubine from the Crown Games, the 31 - year - old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had “strong opinions ” on how to deal with this matter.
"What has gone wrong with the masculinity at the moment? "
“ What have we taught men in their childhood, about the problems we see now? ”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing toxic maleity, due to a very male person on television.
He continued: “What is congenital, and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets that make young boys feel as if they had to be made of a man?
I think it's one of the most important questions of the day--how do we change this?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong with young men."
He also admitted in the interview that he would not play in any other Crusade after the series looks like the next summer and said that he had received “no more of the battlefields and horses. ”
As of November, Kit will play a rediscovering of True West, a picture by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a filmmaker and his robbery brother.
The actor recently said that the best thing about having played at the Crown Games was to meet his wife, Rose.
“ I met my wife in these parts, so that they might give me my future family and my life after that, ” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, Jon Snow's mistress, and Kit played in these Emmy prizes.
The couple married in June 2018, in the country of Lesliar, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people infected with the HIV virus or with AIDS.
The health authorities say that more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
Some 40,000 new infections were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new infections were treated with sex, which is a change from the past.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to the administration of infected blood.
In contrast, the number of people infected by the HIV virus in this way has fallen to almost zero, as Chinese healthcare professionals said at a conference in Yunnan County.
However, the number of people infected with the HIV virus or AIDS has increased by approximately 100,000 from one year to another.
HIV infection caused by sex is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but there is still a strong difference between LGBT and people.
Because of conservative values in the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many people become infected because of inadequate contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised access to HIV medicines as part of a plan to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has leaked data from the Republican senators, criticises “dangerous lies” and “consensual teachings”
On Saturday, Senator Maxine Waters denied the accusation that one of her employees had published personal information from the three Congressmen of the Republican Parliament on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said that these statements came from “superior” extremes and websites.
"Licens, lies, and other miserable lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information published was given according to the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Congressmen Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday from an unknown party on Capitol Hill during the hearings with the Senate of Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court judge, on account of the charges of sexual harassment.
At one point, the leak came after the three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
The conservative pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said that the IP numbers that identify the source of the information were related to the Waters office and published information about one of its employees, as reported by Capitol Hill.
“ This undisputed accusation is completely wrong and pure lie, ” continued Waters.
“ My boss - what personal data and security are now at risk because of these false accusations - was in no way responsible for this information spill.
This unimaginable accusation is completely wrong and pure lies."
Water’s report was quickly criticized on the Internet, including Ara Fleischer, former White House news officer.
“ This denial is full of anger, ” wrote Fleischer.
“ This suggests that she does not have a temper to sit on.
When a person is accused of no cause, do not respond with anger.
Opposition must not be shown.
There is no question about the cause of the accusation.
It has to be calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to the criticism of a democrat on Judge Kavanaugh, who critics said it seemed to be too angry with the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, promoting Republicans against Waters in the Mid - Period Schools, also said his opinion on Twitter.
“ If true, ” he coughed.
In its declaration, Waters stated that her office had informed “the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities of these untrue claims.
“ We will ensure that the guilty will be found, ” she continued, “and that they will be brought to justice for all the things that are damaging and dangerous to all my staff. ”
A movie critic for Johnny English Strikes again - a spy movie with Rowan Atkinson proved to be a little bit of a problem
It has become a habit now to look for the Brexit references in all new films where Britain is involved, and it seems to apply in this resuscitation of Johnny English, a comic series - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and just woke back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this kangaroo satira tell us how sadly we are a new export tool for the country?
Whether that is the case or not, Johnny English’s exaggeration, greed, and clumsiness have been renewed for the second time to screw everything up - his name shows above all that he is a creation designed for exhibition in other than English - speaking countries.
He is, of course, the wise secret serviceman who pretends to have exciting personality powers but is a little bit mixed with Clouseau, a dass of Mr. Bean and a little deleted by the man who played one note for Chariots of Fire at the opening festival of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
He is also originally built on the traveler and the mysterious world citizen who once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television ads, where he left all over himself.
There's one or two great things in this latest Johnny English movie.
I enjoyed watching Johnny English go to a helicopter wearing a middle - aged wedding, and the helicopter blades were in his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his grinability, but the lobster seems rather powerless and strangely superficial, especially now that “more serious” films such as James Bond and the Mission Impossible images also offer a mockery.
The joke seems more intended for children than for adults, and I thought the adventures that Johnny English had had had were not as imaginative and determined as the silences of Atkinson's covetousness in Mr. Beans.
The ever - lasting basis for this film is that Britain is in great trouble.
The computer shark has managed to break into the secret British spy network and have exposed the identity of all British spies, to a great deal for the spy on duty -- but that's where Kevin Eldon's sadly put himself in a small role.
This is the final one for the prime minister, who is arrogant and controversial, and who is in great trouble because of huge political unrest: Emma Thompson is doing his best in his role as a person to remind Theresa May, but the manuscript is not on many fishes for her.
Her counselors tell her that all active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who had sat on a sacred stone.
And there's Johnny English himself, now the principal of some fine school, but it also teaches secretly how to be a spy: here are some funny jokes that English offers to spy schools that remind you of the School of Rock picture.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets Bough, his former long-tired partner, Ben Miller, who plays again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine manager, but in that powerful role near Vicki Pepperdine not quite to let his light shine.
The spy bed that screws everything in her Majesty's service has now returned to the gear, and meets the scoundrel Opheliu Bulletovu, who is played by Olgu Kurylenko.
At the same time, the prime minister is in favour of the enchanting billionaires in the technical sector, who claim to be able to solve British computer problems: it is the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their falloffs: they turn on the fine French restaurant disguised as servants, they cause trouble as they smuggle into Volta’s luxury snake, and English turns everything upside down when he tries to use virtual glasses to introduce himself to the inside of Volta’s house.
There is nothing to be saved in that final point, but although the picture is bright and energyful, some of the child’s substance in it is, however, entirely.
Medium substance.
And just as with the other Johnny English pictures, I could only think: can British film industry allow Rowan Atkinson a role that really fits his skills?
The workers’ group refuses to prepare a four - day work week plan for the British, with the same salary as for the five - day week.
The task force, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is now considering a radical plan that would allow the British to work for four days a week, but get paid for five.
According to the group, managers want to make use of savings generated from the revolution into artificial intelligence and to make employees benefit by receiving one extra day.
If so, employees may spend three days on weekends without a reduction in wages.
Sources say that the idea would “match” with the group’s economic strategy and its policy of improving the interests of workers.
The Trade Union Congress Task Forces have supported the shortening of the working week for four days, which has led workers to make use of changes in their economic situation.
“ It is estimated that a policy review will be announced by the end of the year, ” said a member of the Task Force’s Upper Department of Labour said to Sunday Times.
“ The change will not take place overnight, but the four-day work week is the goal of the group’s approach to change the economy in the interests of the workers and in the overall industrial policy of the group. ”
The workers' group would not be the first to support this idea, but the green group promised a four-day week week on their campaign in 2017.
The objective, however, is not supported by the whole group of workers.
The group spokesperson said: “The four days of work week is not on the group’s policy paper, and the group is not considering introducing it. ”
Last week, John McDonnell, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, used a group convention to describe his ideas of social revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "unidentified prefectors" and "crop congregations" to industry.
The U.S. Secretary's plans also mean that the current shareholders in hydrological companies may not get all of their parts back as the government of the Workers' Party could put on "deduction" because of alleged iniquities.
He has also confirmed plans to set employees of the management committees of companies and to create a common ownership fund to allow 10 percent of the assets of private companies to those employees who could receive 500 pounds of money on a yearly basis.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" if the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could get them to change their mind.
An investigation by the FBI of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a week’s delay in the final vote on his appointment as a Supreme Court judge, and raises the question of whether its findings could lead the Republican Senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that will be shown on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a reporter on the program “60 minutes” of the Republicans and Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked whether the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his school from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“ I said when the trial began, I said that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the accusations were put forward and asked, "Do you do this?"
He was determined, firm, indisputable."
Graham’s vote, however, seems unchangeable.
“ I’ve made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and that would have to be an amazing accusation to change it,” he said.
“ Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but this I know: Brett denied it firmly,” said Graham and addressed Christine Blasey Ford.
“ And everyone she mentions on her name could not confirm that.
This case is 36 years old.
I can't see anything new will change."
What is the International Civic Festival, and has it done something to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be held on Saturday in New York City. It is an annual music event in which a series of major stars will emerge and with similar effective policies; to end poverty worldwide.
This is the seventh year of the International Civic Festival, and tens of thousands of people will fly to Central Park, not only to listen to musical things from among others Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real goal of the Festival to bring an end to the severe poverty of 2030.
The 2012 International Civic Festival is part of the Global Poverty Project (GAL), an international struggle organization that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of those who fight it.
To get free tickets to the event (except for those who want to pay for VIP tickets), musicians had to complete various tasks, or “actions”, such as volunteering, emailing to one of the world’s leaders, calling phone calls, or using other valid ways to help attract attention to their goal of ending poverty.
But how effective has the festival been, even 12 years now, to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with free concerts really a way to convince people to call for action, or is this just but one so-called “melling operation” - where people feel they are doing something that matters by signing a list of requirements on the Internet or sending a message to Twitter?
Global Citizen reports that since 2011, it has recorded over 19 million “actions” from its supporters to call for a variety of goals.
It says that these actions helped to get the world’s leaders to declare commitments and policies that amount to more than $35 billion that will affect the lives of more than $2.25 billion by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and notifications due to its operations, of which at least 10 billion dollars have been invested or collected.
The group estimates that the amount of money collected so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main commitments comes from The Power of Nutrition, a company of investors and executives in Britain who are working to “help children enjoy their full potential,” and promised to give 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help fix malnutrition in the country, after receiving 4700 messages from Global Citizens on Twitter.
“With the support of the British government, fortifications, governments worldwide, and international citizens like you, we can allow the social injustice to which malnutrition belongs to the past,” said Tracey Ullmann, representative of The Power of Nutrition to listen to audiences in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5000 calls were sent for Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide them with better food.
On a list of common questions on the website of the group, one question is, “Why do you think you can end suffering poverty?”
Global citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult task — sometimes we will fail constantly.
But we will achieve our goal, like movements that fought for the rights of citizens and the disintegration of racial separation before us, for we are stronger together.
Among those who attend the event this year are Janet Jackson, the Weekd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe. The event will be held in New York and the introductions are Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a “block” to prevent the energy export of Russia, says the Secretary of State.
“ If necessary, ” says Ryan Zinke, U.S. Secretary of State, according to a report by Washington Examiner, “can use the Navy to prevent energy in Russia from coming on the market. ”
Zinke argued that Russia’s aid to Syria, especially where the country works at the hands of the legal government there, would be the pretext for a new market.
“I think their reason for being in the Middle East is that they want to do business with energy like Eastern Europe and its southern parts,” he should have said according to sources.
And, according to a public announcement, there are ways and means to resist it.
“ The U.S. states can use the Navy to ensure that shipping routes are open and, if necessary, to ensure that the energy from them cannot be placed on the market, ” he said.
Zinke addressed a guest meeting at the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity group that calls itself “the voice of the energy nut in the United States. ”
He continued to compare Washington’s approach to coping with Russia and Iran and said that she was more or less the same.
“The economic choice for Iran and Russia is more and less beneficial for energy and to replace them with others,” he said, saying, and he told Russia, having only one memory card with a economy dependent on fossil fuel.
These statements follow the fact that the Trumps regime wants to increase its exports of gas to Europe and replace Russia, which is much cheaper for European consumers.
To do this, government officials in the government of Trumps, including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to discontinue participation in the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 project to add new energy management, which Trump says would make Berlin “capture” Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the 11 billion dollars of Nord Stream 2 energy supply, which will double the current supply of up to 110 billion cubic metres, is just an economic project.
The Russians say that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is simply continued for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“ I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for using pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the supplies,” said Aleksandr Novak, Russian Minister for Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, U.S. Minister for Energy, in Moscow in September.
The situation in the United States has been criticized by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Federation of German Industries (BDI) has called on the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and a bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
“I don’t like the fact that an alien state is changing from our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting with Angelu Merkel, German Chancellor, and Vladimir Putin, Russian president.
Elizabeth Warren will “think seriously” to submit to the Presidential Assembly in 2020, she says:
On Saturday, Senator Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said that she would “think seriously” to offer herself to the president after the mid - period polls.
Warren confirmed that she would consider offering herself at a civil meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and order our government, and then a woman will also be needed as a leader,” she said, according to a report from The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider offering myself to the President's office."
Warren spoke of Donald Trump’s president at the meeting and said that he was “going with the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been adamant in his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his appointed Supreme Court judge.
Friday, Warren told Twitter that “we must, of course, have the FBI investigate the matter before the vote goes on.”
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that the majority of voters in Warren’s state do not believe that it should be proposed in 2020.
Fifty - eight percent of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not volunteer, according to a survey published by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent claimed to support her offer.
The study showed that Deval Patrick, a former governor, was more supportive, with 38 percent claiming to support his potential offer and 48 percent claiming to oppose it.
Among other popular Democrats discussed for potential presidential promotions in 2020 were Joe Biden, former vice president, and Bernie Sanders, Senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would make a public decision in January, according to a report from the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaks of shock stress disorder Track Palin at Donald Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for one year after entering the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
“ My son is going through a great deal of trouble after coming back, I feel with other families that are affected by stress disorder and the spiritual wounds our soldiers are returning home with, ” she said to the audience at a election meeting for Donald Trump, Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the enemy in the room ” and said that her son and other war soldiers“ are coming back a little different, they are tough, wondering if any respect is given to what their companions in the army and the Air Force and other military departments have done for the land. ”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, for trying to prevent a report of domestic violence, and for an armaments under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, police officer in Wasilla.
18 counties and Washington D.C. support a challenge against a new asylum searcher policy
Eighteen states and Washington City support the legal challenge against a new United States policy that refuses victims who flee gang or home violence on heels.
State officials 18 and the city submitted a trial report on Friday in Washington to support a chancellor protesting the policy, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the prosecution in Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union has presented against the federal policy has not been given up.
She said that her spouse, “and his violent sons who were walking, ” used her violence, but on July 20, the U.S. government workers refused her asylum application.
She was put in custody in Texas.
The defendants who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries where problems related to walks and domestic violence are growing, and the number of asylum seekers in the United States comes from those countries.
The new asylum search policy reverses the decision of the immigration appeal committee in 2014 to allow unwanted immigrants who fled home violence to apply for asylum.
In a statement on Friday, Mr. Karl Racine, D.C.'s U.S. Attorney General, stated that the new policy “was ignored for decades by state and international law."
“ General Government requires a decision on all asylum applications based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy is contrary to this rule, ” said the legal report.
In addition, the report stated that the policy of refusing immigrants to enter the United States would be harmful to the economy, claiming that immigrants would be more likely to set up a business and “take important work force.”
Jeff Sessions, U.S. Attorney, ordered immigration judges to stop giving refuge to victims who fled home violence and gang violence in June.
“ Those who leave their country because of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, or membership of a certain community group or political survey can take refuge, ” said the June 11 issue of Sessions.
Stunning was never meant to solve all the problems, not even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperationful rescue operations in the race to find the survivors in Pala, when the dead are doubled
Conditions become increasingly difficult for survivors.
“ There is a lot of tension in the air, ” said Risa Kusuma, 35 - year - old mother, when she comforted her sick son at the relief center in the city of Palu.
“ Hospitals bring dead bodies here all the time.
There's little clean water."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their desolate homes and searching their water - sugar possessions to try to save what they could find.
Dogs were injured, and hospitals are overcrowded and damaged after the earthquake, which measured 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who were broken back and shoulders, were outside the Pau military hospital, where patients were encouraged to go outdoors due to continued powerful post-squakes.
A year his eyes filled, as he told how he found the earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save ourselves.
I pushed up to the walls, I think," said Haris to the Associated Press and said that his family had been in town to go to a wedding.
“ I heard my wife calling for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Secretary-General accuses China of "attacks" with "controversial announcements"
A week after a public press release in China published a four - page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper to discuss mutual advantages in trade between the two countries, the U.S. ambassador of China Peking accused of using the United States media to distribute propaganda.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, last Wednesday, spoke about the Chinese newspaper’s advertisement in Des Moines Register - which is the most sold newspaper in Iowa - after prosecuting China to try to get involved in the U.S. Congress, which will be on November 6, China, denies this accusation.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing wanted to get involved in the U.S. Congress was what official U.S. representatives told Reuter’s press office that there was a new stage in an increasing campaign from Washington to use the pressure of China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote business, Beijing and Washington have a hardworking business, with new customs on both countries' imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say that early in the business war, China’s retributors were designed to harm migrants in states such as Iowa, who supported Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador of China and former governor of Iowa to a long time, but that state is moving a lot of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers, and companies.
Branstad, in his late article in Des Moines Register, said in his Sunday article that “China would now be adding to its persecution by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free media.”
“ By spreading his propaganda, the government of China is taking advantage of the loving freedom of speech of the United States and our free media by publishing a costly advertisement in Des Moines Register, ” said Branstad in his article.
“ On the other hand, a few protests can be found in newspaper booths on the streets of Beijing, and there can be no real reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese might have on the worrying economic policies of China, where the media are stuck under the heel of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the largest newspapers in China escaped the offer to publish ” his article, but he did not mention what it was.
Experts warn that the Republicans are making female voters dissent them for mid-term discussions with the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned against negative reactions, especially from women, in the next mid - period sessions, because many Republicans have supported and defended Brett Kavanaugh, a designated Supreme Court judge, who has accepted the charges for sexual harassment.
Very strong feelings have been around this issue, and most Republicans have already shown publicly that they wanted to start voting.
“It is not possible to reverse these things,” said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Institute of Maxwell School at Syracuse University, at The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that in the last minute of an investigation by the FBI, Jeff Flake, Senator of the Republican Republican Republican Republican Republic, would be enough to calm the voters.
“ Women won’t forget what happened yesterday, they won’t forget it tomorrow and not November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, director and spokeswoman for the liberal group MoveOn, on Friday, according to Washington D.C.
On Friday morning the Protestants sang “November Arrives!” protesting on the passages of the Presbyterian Department when the Republicans who ruled the Board decided to proceed with Kavanaugh’s appointment, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, according to Mic.
“ The interest and enthusiasm of the voters will go out of all power,” said Stu Rothenberg, independent of political opinion, at the news website.
“ People will say that the interest was already great, and it is true.
But he could be bigger, especially with female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18-29 years of age, who don't like the President, but rarely choose."
The researchers foretold a setback if the Republicans were to have Kavanaugh confirmed, even for Ford’s witness, where she described her accusations of sexual assault from him.
“ It’s become a big mess for the Republican Party, ” said Michael Still, former member of the Republican Group’s National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote of the committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it’s also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it,” said Guy Cecil, president of Priorities United States, a group that helps to vote for Democrats, at the news station.
On the other hand, the United States seems to disagree with whom to believe after a witness from both Ford and Kavanaugh, and the majority of them support the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly believed or probably believed from Ford, while 35 percent claimed to believe in Kavanaugh’s faith or likely witness.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said that they played Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied in their testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the request from the Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations that Ford put forward and from at least one other woman, Deborah Ramirez, according to a report from the Guardian.
Ford witnessed the oath before the Presiding Committee last week, saying that Kavanaugh attacked her when she was 17 years old and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says that Kavanaugh carried her genitals in front of her when they were both at a party as a student at Yale University in the '90s.
The man who invented the internet has plans to start a new Internet to fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the net, is going to set up a sprat company to fight Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the technical legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, an open plant called Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access any information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee told me that the intention behind Inrupt was "world rule."
"We've got to do this now," he said about the snooping company.
"This is a historic moment."
The program uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own “personal online data store” or POD.
There you can find a list of contacts, to-do lists, calendars, music collections, and other personal and work - related devices.
This looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique feature of the personal data store is that it is completely below the user who can access any information.
The company calls it “personally powerful by using data”.
According to John Bruce, the head of the company, the idea is that Inrupt, the company provides resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to all.
Now the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security facility purchased by IBM, a number of programmers appointed as project promoters for the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technological developers around the world could make their own independent applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not in touch with “Facebook and Google about whether to initiate a complete change that would put their current business model on their head in one night.
"We don't ask for permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published on Saturday at Medium that Inrupt had “the aim of creating energy in business and ecosystems that helps to protect the honesty and quality of the new website based on Solid."
Berners-Lee exchanged the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and president of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even while he comes inrupt.
“I’m optimistic for the next period of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: The Priest and Manager of the Victory Cross of World War I
The only English priest to be honored with the Victorian cross during the first world war that a soldier has been hailed in his hometown 100 years later.
On September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaukourt, Father Bernard Vann, who held the position of chief of the army, received the cross.
However, the sniper killed him four days later, and he was never told that he had received the highest honor of the British army.
Two of his great-grandfathers exposed a monument about him on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, Saturday.
One of his grandfathers, Michael Vann, said that it was “decently symbolic” that the monument was exposed exactly 100 years from the glory of his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette magazine, on September 29, 1918, the Undermaster of the Water led his army over the Canal de Saint-Quentin sheath “through a very thick fog and under a hard shooting attack from cannons and machine guns.”
Later, he ran to the line of fire and with “a great deal of courage, ” leading the line forward before attacking a cannon of his own team and overcoming three soldiers.
On October 4, 1918, only a month before the end of the war, Colonel vanguard was killed by a German sniper.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s heroic powers were “something I could never do, but something that makes you humble. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a flower crane after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he was “a great honor to be part of the parade,” and he added that“the devils of a true hero are shown with the support that so many show. ”
MMA fans woke up all night watching Bellator 206, got to see Gurru pig
Just imagine, having woken up all night to see the overcrowded Bellator 206, just to be denied the main event.
The program included 13 battles from San Jose, six of them on the main file, and they were shown in live broadcasts all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 o’clock in the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British audiences had an unexpected appearance when the broadcast changed to Gurru.
Some were unhappy after watching the fight all night.
One fan of Twitter described the switch to the infantry as “any sort of sick joke. ”
“ According to official regulations, the material was not suitable for audiences at six o’clock in the morning, so they had to switch to children’s material,” said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communication for Bellator, when asked to the broadcast.
"Gurrel pig, yes."
Scott Coker, director of Bellator, said they would go over their schedule and take the audience in Britain with them in the future account.
“I think when I think about the replay that we could probably sort this out,” said Coker.
“ But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday there, and we can’t settle this until Sunday at their own time, which is Monday with them.
But we're working on this.
Believe me, when it was broadcast, many text messages were sent back and forth, and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix this, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was an official problem.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We limit the night at five battles instead of six, as usual, but we tried too much and went out of our way.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "disorder" because of sexuality
According to the notes of the Olympic duke, “Tom Daley ” has experienced a lack of respect for other people in his childhood because of his sexual tendencies, but it has encouraged him to succeed.
The 24th-year-old Daley said that he did not realize that he was “different from others” until he went to high school.
In the Desert Island Disc radio program on Radio 4 channel, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said that he spoke about homosexual rights to give “hope to others. ”
He also said that his parental role reduced his interest in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual partner, has taken several months off for illness.
Daley, who was in Laverne's first act, said that he felt like a "less man" than everyone else when he was a child because "the community didn't approve of being into both boys and girls."
He said: “As far as today’s world is concerned, these feelings have moved me to feel inferior and have given me the strength and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone at the end of his sexual relationship.
Double the Olympian Sea has made a great effort to support LGBT and used its participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more nations to legislate homosexuality.
He said he would be heard because he felt lucky to be able to live in public without punishment and wanted to give others “hope. ”
The world champion three times said that it had been “a surprise to him” to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley married his 20 - year - old Oscar Prize winner earlier than he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
“ When you go through so much when you’re young,” he joined his 14 - year - old Olympics, and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was difficult to find equal ages who had experienced similar success and difficulties.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley, saying that his “all visions of life ” would have been bullied.
“ If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold prize, ” he said.
“ Know what, it’s more important than the gold prize at the Olympics.
Robbie is my Olympic Gold Award."
His son is baptized in the head of Robert, his father, who died in 2011, 40 years of age, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not agreed that he would die, and one of the last things he had asked was whether they had received their tickets for London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“ I couldn’t tell him that he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row, ” he said.
“ I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until his breath stopped, and he was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible, ” he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze prize.
“ I just knew that I had dreamed of it all my life, to dive in front of the viewers on the home field at the Olympics, and it doesn’t feel any better, ” he said.
There was also inspiration for the selection of the first song--Proud by Heather Small--who had inspired him for the Olympics and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on the BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m.
Mickelson in bad shape and left on the class in Ryder's cup on Saturday
The American man Phil Mickelson will appreciate Sunday when he plays his 47th game in Ryder's cup, but he needs to find his old rhythm so that the value is not surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who plays in the 12th time of the race, was put on the class after the lead Jim Fury's decision for the four ball games and four games on Saturday.
Rather than being the center point of the hash, as he has been so often before for the United States, the day is divided by the five -fold master between being cheerleaders and practicing the plays on the field in the hope of correcting what he is doing.
Mickelson, 48 years old, was never the one who shot straight with the foxes, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National Golf Airport, where longings often punish for bad shots.
And not only is the golf course a great challenge in itself, but Mickelson has to compete against Frances Molinari, the winner of British Open, in the ninth game on Sunday. Molinari is with the new agent Tommy Fleetwood, and together they have won all four of their games this week.
If the four - score Americans take the first game of 12 single - team games, starting with a good start, they could play Mickelson’s game.
Fury declared trust in his husband, but he could hardly say much else.
“ He fully understood the role he had today, clapped me on his back, and took me around, and said that he would be ready tomorrow, ” said Fury.
“ He has a lot of confidence.
He's at the famous palace, and he's been so much better for the past and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I saw more, but this ended, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everybody else."
Mickelson will hit Nick Fallo in the number of played games in Ryder's cup on Sunday.
This could be the end of the process in Ryder’s cup, which has never reached just as high a level as other achievements on his file.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and 7 equals, but Fury said that his presence had a certain unclear effect on the team.
“ He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s funny, he enjoys making fun of people, and it’s great to have him in the company room,” he explained.
“ I think the younger players enjoyed teasing him too this week, and it was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just the golf game."
Thomas Bjorn, President-in-Office of the European Union, knows that a great deal of advance can quickly disappear.
European leader Thomas Bjorn knows from the experience that a good start for the last day of the individual race in Ryder’s cup can easily turn into uncomfortable experience.
The dance was first played in Valderrama in 1997, where, side by side, under the head of Seve Ballesteros, the United States had five-point pretexts, but it was only right to challenge victory at the end with the smallest possible score, with 141⁄2-131⁄2 victories.
“It reminds us constantly that we had a lot of head start in Valderrama, we had a lot of head start in Brookline, where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, but only right,” said Bjorn, as seen here in the picture, after watching the 2018 vintage work 5-3 both on Friday and Saturday and reaching the 10-6 preamp on the Le Golf National Hill.
The story will show me and everyone in the team that it's not over yet.
We'll make every move tomorrow.
Let's go do everything right.
It is not over until all the grades are on the tablet.
We have our goal, and we are trying to win this cup, we are focusing on it.
I've always said this, I've focused on the 12 players in our team, but we're very conscious of our opponents in the other team -- the best golfer in the world."
Bjorn was highly pleased with how his players had stood on a difficult path and added: “I will never do this to myself.
Tomorrow will be a different day.
Tomorrow it's the performance of the individuals that matters, and that's another thing.
It's great to play with partners when everything goes well, but when you play alone, you try all your talent as a golfer.
It is the message that must be sent to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and he also has to play his best game himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, will strive to make his players stand better in individual games than with his partner, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Fryk himself has experienced both sides of this great transformation on the last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brookline but ended up losing when Europe performed “the miracle in Medinah.”
“ I remember every goddamn word, ” he answered, “how Ben Crenshaw, the leader of 1999, had continued his players before the last day.
“ We have to play 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start fast, as happened in Brookline and Medinah.
When the crawler grows up, it causes a great deal of pressure on the games that are in the middle.
We ordered our players according to it and let them play as we feel will go best tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defense and playing against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half of the games.
“ I chose these players in this row, because I think they will cover all the way through,” said Bjorn of his choice on the players in the individual contest.
The new warship of Germany has again been postponed
The latest German Navy warships should have been built in 2014 to replace old ships from the Cold War period, but it will not be ready until next year for the first time because of broken systems and ever - increasing costs, according to news reports in the area.
Building on the “Rheinland-Palatinate,” the leading ship of the brand-new warships of Baden-Wuerttemberg, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to reports from the military spokesman who spoke to Die Zeit.
The ship was supposed to have been taken advantage of by the Navy in 2014, but serious problems after the delivery of the project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg Company ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to replace the Bremen Company's ships, which have arrived for their years.
They should be equipped with more powerful cannons, multiple air-protection and marine missiles and hiding techniques such as reduced radar infrared, and sound signals.
Other important features are longer use times - it should be possible to use the latest ships for up to two years away from their homes.
On the other hand, consistent reports suggest that these latest ships - reportedly enable Germany to demonstrate their strength at sea - will be outdated when finally taken into account, says Die Zeit.
The F125 ship was released last year when the German army officially refused to accept the flare and returned it to the Blohm & Voss skipper in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
The reasons for the divorce were not known, but the German media talked about many women seriously “failures in software and hardware” that would render the military ship useless if sent to a military mission.
Software defects were particularly important, as Baden-Wuerttemberg's battleship will be operated by 120 crews, half as much as Bremen's warships.
It was also found that the ship was far too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the ability of the Navy to improve it in the future.
The 7000 ton “Rheinland-Palatinate” ship is estimated to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from hardware defects, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - is starting to cause problems.
It is said that it reached EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), but it was originally supposed to be EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems that plague the latest ships are particularly important in the light of warnings that German superiority is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Mr. Hans-Peter Bartel, head of the German Defence Committee, acknowledged that the Navy was actually becoming “a vessel capable of operation. ”
The agent said that the problem had overdued in time, since older ships were taken out of service, but no ships replaced them.
He regretd that none of the commands of the Baden-Wuerttemberg party could be taken in use by the Navy.
National Trust in the Conservation Organization spying on the Secret Life of Leather
The aim of a new study carried out in Scottish highlands is to find out how bats use the landscape when they fish for food.
It is hoped that the results will bring a new light to the behaviour of these individual flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland Institute, will monitor different types of bats in the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
A special recording device will be placed in key locations around the area to monitor the behaviour of the bats over the period.
NHS staff and volunteers will also be involved in monitoring with handheld sensors.
Experts will record all recordings to find out the frequency of the calls that the bats give away, and what kind of things do they do?
The map of the habitat and the report will then be published to give a precise picture of their behaviour on a geographic scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS Vice-Chairman, hopes that the results will reveal what kind of settlements are most important for the bats and how they are used by each type.
This information will help determine the options for the management of habitats, e.g. by creating meadows and how to maintain forest land for bats and other associated species.
Over the last century in Scotland and throughout Britain, the number of bats has decreased considerably.
They are at risk from construction and development projects that affect their nests and reduce their settlements.
Windmills and light can also give rise to risks, including fly paper and certain chemical treatments on construction materials, as well as attacks by household nurses.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their ears are more beneficial than their eyes when it comes to hunting prey, because they are used to hunting at night.
They used highly developed rock - mass media to locate insects and objects on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land all over the country, takes bats very seriously.
Ten experts who conduct regular investigations work at the organization’s premises, as well as some rescue operations.
The organization has even set up the first and only batland of Scotland at the Threeave farmhouse in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten types of leather bats have their homes.
David Thompson, the keeper of the farm, says that he is a perfect area for them.
“The area here at Threave is great for bats,” he said.
“ We have old buildings, plenty of grown trees, and plenty of good settlements.
But there is still a lot of ignorance about bats, so that the work we do here and in other places will help us understand better what they need to do."
He stressed the importance of checking with bats prior to maintenance, since the possible accidental destruction of one nest can kill up to 400 female bats and young people and destroy all bats in the area.
Bats are protected, and killing them, assaulting or interrupting, or destroying their nests is forbidden.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have much to learn about bats, and we don’t know how well many of their species are going. ”
Ronaldo denys the charges for rape when lawyers prepare for the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has accused him of rapeing “forgery news, ” saying that people want to“ draw attention to themselves ” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to legalize the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the accusations.
The advance of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rapeing an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He's been told to pay her $375,000 to keep her informed of the incident, according to Der Spiegel's report on Friday.
A few hours after the accusations were published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, told Instagram Live video to 142 million of his followers that they were “forged. ”
“ No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today is false news," said the world champion five times to the camera.
“ These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and everything's fine," added the player to smiling.
Lawyers Ronaldos prepare for Der Spiegel’s prosecution, which they have called “an unacceptable display of suspicions of private life, ” according to Reuter’s newspaper.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that Ronaldo would demand an improvement for “a pain of the same magnitude as the severity of the offense, which is probably one of the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years. ”
The alleged incident has taken place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palm Hotel and the casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he should have raped her in the end, according to documents submitted to the Clark County County County County County in Nevada.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the very incident and told her he was a "99 percent good man" who has fallen into temptation because of the "1 percent."
The documents argue that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex but that they had both consented.
Mayorga argues that she went to the police and had her injuries taken to the hospital, but finally agreed to settle outside the courtroom because she was “dead afraid of revenge” and was concerned about becoming“ publicly humiliated.”
She now says she wants to quit the foods because she is still in shock after the supposed incident.
Ronaldo was near going to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape was due, and in the summer he went over to Italian giant Juve with a 100 million euro deal.
Brxit: Britain would “see for ever” to lose car manufacturers
Britain would “keep an eye on it forever” if it lost its position as a global leader among car manufacturers, according to Brexit, says Secretary of Business.
He added that it was “a concern” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a contract, the company would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnston, near Derby.
"We need a contract," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that if Brxit without a contract become a reality, the effect would be to take a job.
The Burnaston factory producing Toyota Auris and Avensis produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were moved to other European Union countries.
“It is my opinion that if Britain falls out of the EU by the end of March, we will see the manufacturing plants in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, President of Toyota of Burundi.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concerns about the exit from the EU without agreeing on the way in which international trade should take place, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brxit.
The main concern lies in the fact that if Brxit without a contract becomes a reality, what car manufacturers claim to be a target chain risk.
The production lines of Toyota are based on a “last moment” acceptance, with parts delivered every 37 minutes from both British and EU vehicles produced after ordering.
If Britain withdraws from the EU without a contract on 29 March, there could be interference with the trade barriers that the industry believes can lead to silence and lack of components.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than daily stocks at its plant in Derbyshire, the company said, and therefore production would stop.
Mr. Clark said that the Chequers programme Theresu May for a future relationship with the EU “is aimed specifically to prevent these views at the border.”
“We have to have a contract, we want the best deal that will enable us to enjoy not only the success of today but the opportunity that we can take advantage of,” he said on radio on BBC Radio 4.
“ The evidence, not just from Toyota but from other producers, shows that we must be able to continue with a very successful approach.
Toyota could not say how long their production would stop, but warned that for a long time increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallar, who has been working in Burnston for 24 years and who is a confidant of the factory union, said that his colleagues were increasingly concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs go away, they never come back.
The government spokesperson said: “We have submitted a precise and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
On Sunday, the White House declared that an important meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein, a member of the State Attorney General, could be “free again for one week” today, the dispute over Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court judge, continues.
Rosenstein is in charge of Robert Mueller’s work, a special prosecutor who is investigating Russian elections, a link between the assistants of Trump and Russia, and possible obstacles to the progress of justice by the President.
For weeks, reports have been in Washington about whether Trump will run an assistant prosecutor and thereby endanger Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times said that Rosenstein had discussed carrying a tape recorder to discuss with Trump and the possibility of turning the president out of office by using the 25th Supplementary Rule of the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied these statements.
But last Monday, he visited the White House, with news that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, then he was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that he wanted to run Rosenstein, but then he was tempted to be at the same time as the hearing of the Electoral Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who have accused him of sexual harassment, witnessed both.
On Friday, the FBI's Trump ordered a week - long investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, which even more delayed the vote of the Senate.
Sarah Sander, the media representative of Trumps, was on the program Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, she said: “It has not been a date for him, it could be this week, and I think he may be tempted another week because of everything else that is going on at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and it's always my pleasure to inform the media."
Some reporters disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The director Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not because of dissatisfaction that TV reporters had “syntheticism, ” but she said,“ I do not disagree with the fact that they have virtualism. ”
She then indicated that a direct relationship between Trumps and the media would increase.
“The President answers more questions from the media than any other president has done before,” she said, without referring to the authority, “We have gone over these figures.”
A press conference will continue, said Sanders, but “if the media have a chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it is far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of it, and you've seen us do a lot of it over the last few weeks, and it's going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or media meetings with other visitors.
The media meetings with him alone are rare.
The president may have shown why in New York this week, when he showed unrelenting behavior and in times of strange conduct in front of a group of reporters.
Minister of Health writes EU Health Services in Scotland because of the concern of Brxit
The Minister of Health has written a staff from the EU who work in the health care system in Scotland (NHS Scotland) to describe the appreciation of the people and wish that they will continue to work after Brxit has come through.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter after less than six months until Britain leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already promised to cover the cost of a work permit application for EU citizens working in the public service sector.
In his letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “For the past few summers, discussions between the UK and the EU have continued because of the decision-making process and are expected to take place in the fall.
The British Government has also worked to prepare if no contract is possible.
I know this must be a lot of uncertain times for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the work of the entire staff, no matter what their nationality is.
Co-operatives from the EU and across have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after having had a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a lineman for Tennessee State Tigers, had to undergo an emergency surgery after having had a head injury in a 31-27 loss game against the Vanderbilt Commodores team on Saturday, as reported by Mike Organ, journalist Tennessee.
Rod Reed, director of Tennessee State, told the reporters that the trauma had been a short time ago.
“ He came to the sideline and fell down there, ” said Reed.
Trainers and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen at the sideline before being placed on the bar and carried out for a closer examination.
An agent from Tennessee State told Chris Harris, a radioman WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had had an operation at the hospital in Vanderbilt.
Harris added that it was “no information about the type or severity of the impact yet” and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the accident happened.
Abercrombie, last year at school, plays her first season with Tennessee State after leaving Illinois.
He had five rounds on Saturday before he left, which increased the total number of bitches in him to 18.
Foreign buyers get higher plunger charges when they buy real estate in Britain
Foreign buyers will be asked for higher plungers when they buy real estate in Britain. The amount will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Maintenance Group plan.
The operation will eliminate the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
Increased plunger charges will be applied to non-taxers in Britain
Kingdom funds plan to make 120 million pounds a year - to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be garnished for higher plunger charges when they buy real estate in Britain. The amount will be used to help the homeless. Theresa May will announce this today.
The operation will be considered as an attempt to eliminate the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by promising housing for a more convenient price and taxing seniors.
Individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain need to pay higher plunger charges, and the excess will go to the government’s actions to help the homeless.
The increase - which is in addition to the current plunger charges, including the increase that was made in two years ago in the extra home and rent purchase - could be up to three percent.
National funds estimate that up to 120 million pounds a year will be raised.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new buildings in London are bought by foreign partners, which results in increases and makes those who want to buy real estate for the first time harder to enter the market.
Many of the more wealthy areas in the country - especially in the capital - have become “deep cities ” because of the number of foreign merchants who spend most of their time abroad.
The new strategy will come only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in plunger charges to help other young people get their first home.
He accused a large construction company of keeping real estate high by buying land but not using it, and urged May to stop bundling households at reasonable prices to fix “house conditions” in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has reported a number of reliable renovations on housing issues, including rent monitoring and the end of rent-free outsourcing.
He also wants to give more power to build a new home.
Theresa May said: “I said that last year I would devote myself to the restoration of the British dream in my first period - that every new generation should enjoy better living.
And that means that our property market is ruined.
The doors of Britain will always be opened to those who want to live here, work, and build up their lives.
On the other hand, it cannot be true that it is as easy for foreign people as a company with foreign headquarters to buy homes and hard - working British citizens.
For many the dream of their own house is far too far away: and the shame of houselessness is still too real.
Jack Ross: "My main goal is to train Scotland."
Jack Ross, Coach Sunderland, says that it is his “most goal” to become Scotland’s trainer sometime.
These 42-year-olds are now taking advantage of the challenge of blowing new lives in the North-East Club now in third place in the first department, three points from the top.
He moved to Sunderland for the summer after St. Mirren returned to the Scottish selection department during the last season.
“ I wanted to play for my people as a player.
I got hurt on my knee and that's why it was over," said Ross in an interview with Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
“ But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden often with my father, a child, and there is always something that has pulled me back.
But that opportunity would only be possible if I was doing well to train the unit."
The predecessors Ross as trainers of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of the Alloa Athletic Club said he did not feel any fear of following in the footsteps of such a famous name at such a large club, which he had previously rejected training positions at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“ Just as it is, I will measure my success by thinking, ‘ Can I get this club back to the top class? ’
This club has no doubt at home in the prime department because of its structure and situation," he said.
"It's not an easy job to get him there, but I'd probably just consider myself a success here if I get the club back up there."
Ross has only three years of experience as a trainer after a period as an assistant trainer at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of a Heart Training Officer.
He helped Alloah to recover from falling into the third division, and changed St. Mirren, who was in the fall of a division, into a division champion the next season.
Ross says he's self-confident now, but he was ever in his game at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“ It was probably a real date, ” he says about the period when he became a coach of Alloa.
“ I really believed that the training work would suit me, even more than playing.
It sounds strange, because I went well, I had a decent income from it, and I enjoyed a good success.
However, changes can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure from work, but the coaching work seems to be right for me.
I always wanted to train, and now I do, I've never felt better with myself in all my adult years."
You can listen to the whole interview at the Sportsound show on Sunday, September 30, on Radio Scotland between 12.00 and 13.00 at the British time
The best time for beer is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays, according to a poll.
The heat supply this summer has proved to be profitable for British bar that is in trouble, but it increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, there was an increase of 2.7 percent in mobs and bars, while in restaurants the sale decreased by 4.8 percent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, from the CGA Business Council, who collected the figures, said: “The continuing sunshine and the unexpected success of England in the world cup meant that July followed a pattern similar to that of June, when bars increased by 2.8 percent, except for restaurants sold even less.
Salan fell by 1.8 percent at restaurants in June and got worse again in July.
People and bars, which focus mainly on the sale of drinks, were the best with greater fluctuations during their restaurants.
People who sold food also had difficulty in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems people just wanted to go out drinking.
Drinks were sold by mobs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent by the month, but meals were reduced by three per cent."
Paul Newman, from the research firm RSM, said: “These results continue on the swing that we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of important social or sports events are still the biggest factors in selling at home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still in trouble, although a sales reduction of 4.8 percent between months is particularly painful above the cost of continuing pressure.
This long and hot summer could hardly come at a worse time for the dining place and only the time will reveal whether a temperate temperature, as we have in August, will improve the situation."
Total sales growth in bugs and restaurants, including in newly opened locations, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting how the openings have progressed.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the surveillance firm with sales to the British observatory and restaurant stores, collects and reports data from 47 business groups, with a combined roll of £9 billion and is the industry target for the sector.
One in five children have secret accounts on community media they hide from their parents
One in five children, down to 11 years of age, have secret accounts on the social media that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to the results of a survey.
A survey of 20,000 students showed an increase in the “Insta” pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual substances
Twenty percent of students claim to have an “algae” account that they are showing parents
One in five children, down to 11 years of age, make secret accounts of the social media they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students showed a large increase in Insta’s “gervi” accounts - a reference to the Instagram website.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual material.
Twenty percent of students said that they had a clean “normal ” account to show parents, as well as a secret account.
One mother, who fell on her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret website, found a youth who encouraged others to “inculcate me. ”
The study by Digital Awareness UK and HMC showed that 40 percent of children aged 11-18 had two accounts and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of the HMC, said: “It is worrying that so many youths are tempted to create an area on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them. ”
Eilith Doyle will be the “Red of Sportsmen” in the Scottish Athletics Sports Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected in the Scottish Athletics Committee as an officer without the authority of the government during the annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s luckiest free sportsman and Ian Beattie, the chairman of the Committee, said that the nomination was a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience in the past decade.
“Elidh enjoys great respect within sports communities in Scotland, Britain, and internationally, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would make a great deal of money to get it on the committee, ” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am very interested in speaking on behalf of athletes and I hope that I can work hard and help to continue sports in Scotland. ”
The American, who worked among anannar 200 meters and 400 meters in the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, but a total of four Olympic gold, and now a regular guest at the BBC, was paralysed after a transient ischaemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would tell me whether I would recover and then how much.
It's been a hard job, but I did it all the time, learned to walk again, and do sports exercises today!
Thank you for your words of encouragement!"
Mother-to-kiln breast-pump advertising causes an analysis of the network
Enterprises producing breast-feeding pumps are now listed on the Internet as a result of advertisements that carry lactating mothers to cows that are milked.
The company Elvie published a popular advertisement to mark the presentation of what is said to be “the first silent breast pump in the world that can be carried outside. ” The advertisement is inspired by musical tapes and should show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers who are breast-feeding.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of haystacks, and we create a song like, “Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see my tails,” and “If you didn't notice, it's not a virgin, it's my breasts.”
The supplement goes on to say, “Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I pump milk out of the fields.”
However, the advertisement, which appears on the company’s Facebook page, has caused a conversation on the Internet.
The video has 77,000 audiences and hundreds of referees and has had a different response from the audience, who says that she was wearing the “crustrum ” that follows the dairy industry.
“ It’s a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must become calves, and bear to produce milk, except that the calves are taken away from them only a few days after they are born," said one comment.
The Elvie breast pump is suitable for use in the breast- giver (Elvie/Mother)
Another observer wrote: “Very difficult for both mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added: “This advertisement is completely out of control of time. ”
Others came to the defense of the advertisement, and one woman admitted that the song would be “temporary. ”
“ I think this is a great idea.
I would have bought this if I still had a baby.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping milk out of me.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
"It's a genius," wrote one of the audience.
Another said: “This is a fun advertisement that is directly to mothers who pump milk (often at work or inside a toilet) and feels like “cum”.
This is not an advertisement that commends or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the advertisement, the female group shows that they were all dancing with the breast pumps hidden in their breasts.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women say that they feel like cows when they pump milk out.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wire or cords and is conveniently suited to the breast holder, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their child, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, a associate and supervisor at Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is so revolutionary that she understood a prominent presentation that would raise the profile.
By comparing women to cows, we wanted to direct the flashlight to chest pumping and all its challenges, and to show even in a fun and familiar way how much freedom the new pump would give.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has been released.
On a fashion week in London, a mother of two children presented a fashion show to the designer Martha Jakubowski, while she was using the product.
Hundreds of immigrants moved quietly to camp at the Texas border
The number of migrant children in custody has suddenly increased even though the number of people crossing the border has remained somewhat the same in the month.
In general, the foster parents have been unwanted immigrants themselves, and they have been afraid to put their chances of remaining in the country at risk by offering themselves to feed a child.
The risk increased in June, when public authorities announced that potential foster parents and other adults in the home had to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the migration monitoring.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the chief of immigration and customs, witnessed before the Senate and said that his institution had arrested a number of people who sought to feed single children.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not on the criminal record.
“ Nearly 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or in a home that fosters children are illegal in the country, and much of them are illegal immigrants.
“ Why do we keep looking for their individuals, ” said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to speed up child proceedings, representatives reported new rules requiring some children to appear in court within a month of being put in custody, rather than after 60 days of the previous test, according to staff working in the scenes.
Many of them will meet through a video meeting, rather than in person, to justify their legal position before an immigrant judge.
The children who are judged unfit for entry into the country are quickly sent out of the country.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent or evasive attempts, according to the workers of the shelters and reports that the system has published in the past month.
The speakers said that these problems were even more likely in a larger institution, as in Tornillo, where no one likely notice that a child has a problem, because of the number of them.
They added that the transfer of children to the tabernacle city without giving enough time to prepare them spiritually or to say goodbye to friends could increase the shocks that many of them are already experiencing.
Syria tells the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Walid al-Moualem, Foreign Minister, also said in his speech to the General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays the role of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign troops were illegal in Syria, under the false pretext that they fought terrorism, and that “they will be treated accordingly. ”
“ They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions, ” he said to the council.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where more than 350,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to flee their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue “to wage this holy struggle until we clear all the territory of Syria ” from both terrorist groups and“ all illegal foreign parties. ”
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, where most of them train and advise both Ukrainian troops and Syrian Arabs who fight the President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war - torn country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said that circumstances were good enough for them to return, and he taught “some Western countries” to“ spread out a senseless fear ” that encouraged refugees to stay away.
“We have called on international society and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return,” he said.
“ They make politics out of something that should be just a humanitarian issue. ”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not grant any funding for reconstruction in Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a neutral territory at the last major resisting force created an opportunity to continue political dialogue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a great attack by the Syrian troops strengthened by Russia, in the region where three million people live.
On the other hand, Moualem stressed that the agreement had “a clear deadline” and expressed the hope that military action would focus on Jihadis, including the fighters from the Nusra Front, who are connected with Al-Qaeda, and that they “will be destroyed.”
Staffan de Mistura, Ambassador S.D., hopes to be able to attend the first meetings with a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition, to prepare a constitution for Syria after the war and to pay the way for the election.
Moualem set out conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee, saying that its work should be limited to “a review of the regulations of the present government, ” and warned of all actions.
Reasons why Trump will win a second election period
According to this reasoning, Mr. Trump would win the re-elections in 2020, unless charges and scandals end his presidential career, as many liberal audiences are likely to hope for.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end of the presidential career ever!"
As you can see, the audience has no sign of fatigue.
Since 2014, the best time perspective has more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN, and almost triples to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million spectators at the best time, rising from 1.7 million spectators four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s role, “The Rachel Maddow Show,” has peaked its audience with up to 3.5 million spectators on important news nights.
“ It’s a fire that people are attracted to, because it’s something we don’t understand, ” said Neal Baer, a factorial ABC dramatist “Designed Survivor” about a government employee who will be president after the House of Congress has been destroyed in attack.
Nell Scovell, an experienced coroner and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snowing Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” is another coincidence.
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the elections in 2016.
The cab driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?
“ He said, “Because he makes me laugh, ” said Miss Scovell to me.
There's some entertainment in the mess.
Unlike television, however, the stories from Washington may determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether the families of immigrants can be united and the health of the international economy.
Only those spectators who enjoy the most privileges can afford to stop watching.
And yet this is more than being enlightened to a citizen when you watch the sixth time of the group of experts reasoning the use of Bob Woodwards on “afar close” sources for his book“Fears,” or 15,000 dollar jacket from the ostriches that Paul Manafort dressed (“the stuff fed with pride,” said Washington Post) and the consequences of the precise biologic descriptions of Story Daniels on Mr. Trump.
At least I'll never see Super Mario again.
“The feeling of what he does dislikes a man feels this is like a reality factor, that he gives a man something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and author of the “Pawn Stars” elements, when he spoke about the workforce in the display of Trumps and daily changes in the narrative (e.g. starting a fight with N.F.L. and commending Kim Jong-Un).
You can't miss one show, or you lose the thread.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss, there was 26 degrees of heat and sunshine outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he stayed indoors watching MSNB while he took up CNN.
He couldn’t tear himself away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to testify before the Presbyterian Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“ I remember when we were making all these crazy things in the old days, and people said, “This is the beginning of the end of Western civilizations, ” said Mr. Fleiss.
“ I thought it was some sort of joke, but it turned out that people were right. ”

Money to the outside of the narrowest election of the middle period
It is no wonder that the 17th position of Pennsylvania sees the money flowing, thanks to the reorganization of the locations that led to two representatives competing for the same seat.
The newly organized Pittsburg area sends out the Democratic Conor Lamb, who won his seat in the second voting area in the last summer.
Lamb is offering himself to other representatives, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now representing the former 12th voting area in Pennsylvania, who are very close to the new 17th voting area.
The maps of the voting areas were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old voting areas were organized in favour of the Republicans and that it would break the constitution.
The race in the new 17th voting area has begun to compete in the financing of campaigning between the main funders of both categories, the Democratic Commission (DCCC) and the NRTC.
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a special election in March before the 18th in Pennsylvania, but many followed that election.
In the past, the Republicans had weathered it for over a decade, and Donald Trump, President of the United States, had a 20 - point victory.
Political experts have given a little advance to democrats.
The United States sought to punish El Salvador for support of China, but then ceased.
Kingdom writers noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already accepted Beijing, with little protests from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama in June 2017, and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the co-owners ran the Trump team away.
State Department officials decided to call back the U.S. ambassador in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama for “a final decision to accept the Tavan no longer,” said Heather Nauert, the Minister’s spokesperson in a statement early this month.
However, penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received 140 million dollars from the United States for relief work in 2017, including drug monitoring, development and financial support.
Punishments, which included a reduction in financial support and the limitation of sleep permits, would have been painful for the Central America, where high unemployment rates and mortality rates are high.
As indoor meetings continued, the US and Central American representatives postponed a conference on security and economic prosperity and were to follow a similar meeting held last year that was thought to be a step forward in action to prevent people from moving to the United States.
However, by mid - September, representatives made it clear that they wanted the convention to take place and, as a result, they ended up in default of punishment against El Salvador.
Mike Pence, Vice President, is now going to address the conference, which is to take place in the middle of October, as a symbol of how important it is in the eyes of the government, the ambassadors said.
The three American ambassadors also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spoke for Mr. Bolton, who refused to discuss the discussions described by the three U.S. representatives, including two remembering parties, who agreed to discuss the inside speeches against the need to remain anonymous.
Their description was confirmed by an outsider who works closely with the government and also spoke about the matter against anonymity.
Learn History
Robert Mueller's report, a special prosecutor, on the possible action by Mr. Trump to prevent justice, could be the next scandal, but for that charge there are many public evidences.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller will also turn his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign has worked with Russia in its attack on our election.
If the council is controlled by another group, Trump may have to be responsible for it, in the mouth he prepares to see his constituents again, and perhaps his peers may have to be prejudiced.
However, this is very uncertain, and I do not want to argue that the fall of Trumps is unquestionable, nor rather the fall of his colleague in Europe.
We all need to choose, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the battle will be.
In 1938 German rulers were prepared to rob Hitler, only if Western countries had opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the post-war years.
History revolves around such important points and faster or slows down for the unstoppable progress of democracy.
The United States now faces some such important points.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Mr. Rod Rosenstein, the man who runs the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this magazine reported that last year he had made secret recordings of the president and had discussed whether he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the story from Times is not correct.
“ How will we respond if the new FBI investigation at Brett Kavanaugh is not detailed or reasonable, or if it is confirmed in the seat of a Supreme Court judge despite the religious accusation of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote for the mid-term that will give Mr. Trump responsibility?
If we fall on these tests, the democracy will have to wait long winters.
But I believe that we will not fall because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia and was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime and was previously in my ambassador’s home.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with the cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I but take a positive view of our future?"

Graham Dorrans, Rangers, optimistic for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory against the Austrians will put them in a strong position to get out of the G-group of the European Union. Rangers made a magnificent draw in Spain against Villaarreal earlier this month.
Knee injury prevented the middle guard Graham Dorrans from playing his first game on the season until the game against the Wild Land, which ended with a 2-2 draw, but he believes that Rangers can use the score as a jumpboard for better results.
“ It was good to have this stage for us, because Villarreal is a strong team, ” said Dorrans, 31 years old.
“ We began our game in the belief that we could reach something and end up taking one step.
Perhaps we could have called for victory at the end, but in general, there was probably a fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first half, and we got strong in the second half and played better.
Thursday is another important evening for the European Parliament.
I hope we can reach three points, but this will be a difficult game, because they did well in their last game, but with our supporters, I'm sure we'll have this and get a positive result.
The last year was difficult, both because of minor injuries and the changes that occurred in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling at the scene.
The team's good and the boys enjoy themselves, the training's good.
I hope we can go further now, put the last season behind us, and make progress."
Women lose sleep because of the fear of losing their pension savings
Although the participants in the poll had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed this with their family members.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide survey said that they discussed the cost of long - term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children.
“ People want family members to take advantage of it, but they don’t take the right steps to have that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of National Security Department.
That's the first thing to do.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not make your wishes clear with good warning.
Talk to your counselor and your family about where and when you will be cared for, for these options can change much in terms of cost.
Please include your financial adviser: Your counselor may also help you to find a way to pay for this cost.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care are traditional life insurance with long-term care, mixed life insurance that pays out in cash, to help pay expenses, or self-guarantee with your own money - as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: Avoid legal differences in advance.
Get the health care provider to identify someone you trust to supervise your health care and to ensure that healthcare professionals respond to your requests if you cannot speak them directly.
Consider, too, having a protein holder for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your accounts are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother will be in an emergency and going to a hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Give them the exact information in a written schedule so that you are ready.
“ It’s not just about the financial issues, but also who the doctors are, ” Martin said.
“What are the drugs?
Who will guard the dog?
Keep that plan ready."

Earthquakes and Floods in Indonesia
At least 384 died of a powerful earthquake and a tsunami in the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, said representatives, and the number of the dead is expected to rise.
Since all communications lie down, relief workers have been unable to provide any information from the Dongila County, an area north of Pala, located near the center of the earthquake, which was 7.5 in Richter.
More than 16,000 were left in Pala’s home after mischief.
Here are some key facts about Pala and Dongula, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi and is located at the bottom of a narrow flea on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The estimated population was 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th birthday when the earthquake and the tsunami were over.
Dongula is an acid that covers more than 380 km of shoreline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The scheme, which is a regional government, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main professionals in the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the Dongula coastal area.
Nickel mine is also important in the district, but most of them are in Morowali, which is on the beach in the face of Sulawesi.
Flounder waves have scoundrel in Pala and Dongila several times in the last century, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Institute.
In 1938, more than 200 people died when the tsunami struck and hundreds of houses in Dongila destroyed.
In 1996, the western part of Dongila, where nine died, will also be flooded.
Indonesia sits on the active horizon of the Pacific Ocean, where earthquakes are regular.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of last year:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh region in northern Sumatra came across December 26 and started a tsunami that struck on 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the Indian coast, of which over half of them were in Aceh.
2005: The number of strong tremors crossed the west coast of Sumatra late in March and early in April.
Hundreds die on the island of Nias, from the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The Earthquake of 6.8 Richter rided across the southern part of Jöva, the major island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that struck on the southern shore and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The Earthquake of 7.6 Richter headed near Padang, the capital of the province of the west of Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: Earthquake of 7.5 on Richter rided over one of the Mentawai island, near Sumatara, and raised up up to 10 meters high tides that destroyed the number of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: The shallow earthquake struck Pidie Jaya County in Aceh, causing destruction and awe as people remembered the destruction of the deadly earthquakes and flood waves in 2004.
No wave of floods was formed this time, but over 100 died when the building fell.
2018: Large shivering rides across the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, and over 500 people died, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and thousands of tourists were trapped temporarily on the island.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and proselytes, has been arrested for assault.

His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is now being dealt with for the Alaskan surrender court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of preventing the notification of domestic violence and of carrying weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend has claimed that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by sources of soldiers in 2016 after she taught a shocking disorder about the violent conduct of her son, after his military service in Iraq.

At least 384 people died after an earthquake rided over the Indonesian island of Sulawes on Friday.
The Earthquake, which was 7.5 on Richter, launched a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.

The earthquake was just past the center of Sulawesi Island, which lies north-east from Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Movies showing when the incident was now taking place on the social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered together at a coastal festival in the city of Pala when the flood wave struck on the beach.
Prosecutors seek a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York City
New York prosecutors want a death penalty against Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of having participated in a terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for violation of federal law since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is thought to have taken the Home Depot truck to rent to attack people on a wheel road along the West Side Highway street in Lower Manhattan, where he drove down walking and riding walkways in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the victims eight “suspective” and caused serious physical injuries“ misleading” according to the declaration of intent to use the death penalty recorded in the South District Court of New York.
Both of these accusers can lead to possible death penalty, according to the trial.
Many weeks after the attack, Saipov’s federal court accused 22 people, including eight charges for murder for criminal purposes, usually used by prosecutors in charges against organized crime groups, and Saipov was also accused of violent crime and of destroying the car.
The attack involved “a relatively planned design, ” saying the accusers, describing the actions of Sapiov as“ terrible, cruel, and immoral. ”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov was caused by physical injuries, injuries, and loss for family and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferrachi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” says the wishes statement.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last death penalty for New York’s southern district.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in New York City in 1953, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were killed after being convicted of spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both couples were killed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no evidence of repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to legal documents.
He told an investigator that he was comfortable with what he had done, said a police officer.
Saipov told the authorities that he had got the idea of the attack after watching the videos from ISIS on his phone, as stated in the charges.
Also, he asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, said the police.
He has declared his innocence in all 22 stages of the charge.
David Patton, one of the public guards Saipovs, said that they were “absolutely disappointed” by the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to request a death penalty instead of agreeing to a fine declaration against life imprisonment without the possibility of a trial solution will only prolong the incident due to this event for all parties,” said Patton.
The defenders of Saipov's had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek the execution of a death penalty.
The Congressman said that NIGEL FARAGE should conduct negotiations for Brxit.
Nigel Farage promised to “work the people’s army ” today in protests at the convention of the perpetrators.
This former leader of Ukip said that politicians had to “feel pressure” from skeptics about the EU, at the same time as one of Theresa May Congressmen suggested that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
The perpetrator Peter Bone told the Birmingham protesters that Britain “be gone out” now if Mr. Farage was the leader of Brexit.
However, the challenge that May is facing to make a deep distinction between her own members even more apparent is that the perpetrators who wish to remain in the EU participated in other protests against Brxit in the city.
The Prime Minister has difficulties keeping his plan in the right direction, and he is under criticism from those who are in the hands of Brxit, those who are opposed, and the EU.
The Allies claimed that she will continue to fight to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition and force those opposed to Brxit and the Workers' Party to choose between its plans and “unrest. ”
Mr. Bone told Leave Mean Leave protesters in Solihull that he wanted to “flee from the Chequers plan. ”
He suggested that Mr Farage be allowed to take part and shoulder responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“ If he were with the government, we would have gone out now,” he said.
The Senator of Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequer’s plan.
He explained his opposition to the EU and said: “We do not fight in world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone pointed out that the public opinion had changed from the elections in 2016: “The idea that the British public changed their mind and wanted to stay is totally true. ”
Andrea Jenkyn, a persistent Protestant supporter of Brxit, said to the press: “I simply want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unfriendly among the public, and opposition will not choose with it. It enjoys enemyism among our classmates and activists who are on the streets and choose us.
Please, cancel the Chequers plan and start listening."
In direct messages to May, she added: “Principal ministers keep their work when they keep their promises. ”
Mr. Farage said that the politicians would have to “feel pressure” if they were to compromise the decision taken following the vote in 2016.
“ It is now about trust between our people and our political party, ” he said.
“They want to try to betray Brxit and we’re here together today to say to them, “We won’t let you get away with this.”
He added in his message to the crowds: “I want you to let your political party, which is in the process of betraying Brexit, feel pressure.
We are the forces of the public in this country, which gave us victory in Brxit, and we will never rest until we have become independent, self-governing, proud Great Britain."
At the same time, the EU protesters held a two-hour protest meeting in the centre of Birmingham.
A small group of activists waved the flags against Brxit after the group was set up this weekend.
Lord Adonis, from the Workers' Party, made fun of the perpetrators of security problems that arose in the phone program at the opening of the convention.
“ It’s the people who tell us that it can have all computer systems in place and all technologies for Canada plus, for borders without barriers, for free trade with Ireland without borders, ” he added.
“ It’s a complete scandal.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he said.
Warren is going to “think seriously” to submit to the presidency.
A U.S. Senator, Elizabeth Warren, claims that after the elections in November, he will “consider a serious offer to the president. ”
The Boston Globe report says that the Massachusetts Democrats discussed their future at a civil meeting in the west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has been criticising Mrs. Donald Trump of the United States, is offering to re-commerce in November against the Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-governing the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It has been a center of inadequacy that it could promote itself against Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday was 36 C.E., held in the form of a city meeting with residents in her district, since Trump took office.
One attending the meeting asked her if she was planning on offering herself to the president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to “go to Washington and order of our government, and then a woman also needs to be a leader. ”
Arresting for fatal shooting at Sims from LSU
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that she had arrested one suspect in LSU basketball player Wayde Sims' case, who was shot to death on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police reported an arrest at Duteon Simpson, 20 years in a news meeting at 11 a.m.
She had previously published a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying a man who was seen on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot to death near the University of Southern University early Friday.
“Wayde Sims had a gunshot wound in his head and died because of it,” said Murphy J. Paul, chief of police, with the media on Saturday, according to a report from 247sports.
Wayde came to the defense of his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to have been in the field, with weapons in his arms, and admitted to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested in no trouble and put in custody by the police department of the east of Baton Rouge.
Sims was two feet tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, he played in 32 games, ten of which in the beginning during the last season and played an average of 17.4 minutes, scored 5.6 points, and reached 2.9 outcomes in each game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after Sebastian Vetel gives him the victory seat after command from their team.
It was clear from the time that Valtteri Bottas reached a seat in front of Lewis Hamilton for the launch of Saturday, that orders from Mercedes's team would play a big part in the contest.
Bottas got a good start and almost left Hamilton when he defended his position on the first two turns and invited Vetel to fight against his teammates.
Vetel first went to the pit and let Hamilton drive into the traffic at the end of the group, but it should have been able to determine the finals.
The Mercedes car went into the pit one circle later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton came out after a few conflicts where Ferrari was forced to leave the inner side after the danger of remaining, after the defense attempts of the third turn.
Max Verstappen began in the back of the group and was in seventh place at the end of his first ring, on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the contest as he tempted to change tyres to try to finish quickly and leave Kim Raikkonen and reach the fourth place.
He eventually went to the pit at 44nd, but he could not increase the speed of the eight remaining circles, and Raikkonen took the fourth seat.
This is a difficult day because Valtteri stood up all weekend and was a true gentleman to let me out.
The team has been wonderful enough to achieve this success," said Hamilton.
It was a really bad body expression.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday, because of her claim that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in an accusation against Mr. Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court judge, about sexual harassment.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but he did not talk directly about the Ford testimony before the Electoral Committee of Appeal, and he said that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were “bad and cruel and untruthful.”
“ The only thing that could happen and the wonderful things that have been going on in the last days of the Presbyterian Department, when you see the anger, when you see people who are wicked and cruel and false, ” he said.
“ When you see the prints and leaks and then say, “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you look like this?
Remember her answer... did you lose the document-- "Oh, yeah, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't take it."
Wait a minute.
Let's just... No, we don't bow down," he said, following the Senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where the accusations came from Ford against Kavanaugh, which was leaked early in September.
“I didn’t hide the accusations from Dr. Ford, I didn’t relax her story,” said Feinstein to the committee, according to a report from The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it in fidelity, and I did what she asked me to do. ”
However, her denial did not seem to go well into the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday: “I tell you, this was really a bad body language.
Maybe she didn't have anything, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued his defense for Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, and urged that Democrats take advantage of the accusations.
“ They are determined to regain power, no matter what methods to use.
You see the ferocity, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to choose to gain power and rule," said the President, according to a report from Mediaite.

The plane driver gives his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on a plane escape from an earthquake
After his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers could take off safely, he has been praised as a hero by a flight manager in Indonesia.
Over 800 people have left life, and many are missed by a great earthquake that struck the island of Sulawes on Friday and followed by a flood.
Large earthquakes continue to plague the area, and many are trapped in the city of Pala.
The 21 - year - old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave, despite the fact that his partner had fled the control tower that swung violently at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that the Batik Air aircraft number 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake overwhelms, could certainly be in the air.
He then jumped out of the tower when he thought he was falling apart.
He died in a hospital later.
Yohannes Sirait, Air Navigation Indonesia’s spokesman, said that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to a report from ABC News in Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, in Kalimantan, to move it to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palestine.
“ We’re very sad about this, ” he added.
The authorities fear that the number of the dead could go over a thousand, when the country’s disaster facility says that access is limited to the town of Dongila, Sigi, and Boutong.
“ It is believed that the number of deaths is still increasing, since many bodies are still waste, and cannot be reached, ” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the president of the Agency.
As many as six feet [6 m] high waves have caused enormous destruction in Pala, where there will be a mass funeral on Sunday.
The military and passenger aircraft are working to provide tools and supplies.
An 35 - year - old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance comes with a body.
There is little clean water.
The small markets have been robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the Indian International Red Cross, said to CNN: “The Indian Red Cross competes to find survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it might get worse."
Joko Widodo, the president of Indonesia, came to Palu on Sunday and said to the country’s army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the transportation.
Are you ready?" said a report from CNN.
Earlier this year earthquakes struck Lombok, Indonesia, where over 550 people died.
Air Niugini now says the same thing is missing after an aircraft crashed into a loft.
The airline that had a plane that crashed into a lion in Micronesia now says that one person is missing, after saying that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini announced that since Saturday, it did not know about the departure of one male passenger.
The airline said that they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about further information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water when she tried to land at the airport of Chuuk Island.
On Friday, representatives said that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said that six passengers were still in a hospital on Saturday and that all of them were stable.
It is still unclear what caused the accident, and what exactly was the sequence of the incidents.
The U.S. Air Force and Air Force both said that the plane had landed in the loon just ahead of the runway.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane had gone too far over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the aircraft had been very low.
“ It was really good, ” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others could take down the water and get to emergency exits on the sinking aircraft.
He said that the pilots were afraid and screaming and that he had suffered a small head injury.
A U.S. Navy army said that sailors who were working a little while ago to make up a dock also helped rescue by using an inflated boat to transport people ashore, before the plane sank to about 30 feet [30 m] of deep water.
Data from the Air Safety Agency show that 111 people have died in aircraft accidents in PNG-registered aircraft in the past two decades, none of which were related to Air Niugini.
An expert describes the timeline of the night that a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutors completed their case in resumption of a case against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert from the U.S. Justice Department, was in the courtroom for hours as an expert in information analysis.
He described to the abdominal community how he used cell phone records to puddle the accused, 29 - year - old Quinton Tellis, and the 19 - year - old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that he received a location data from a few cell phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to his previous statements, according to a report from The Clarion Ledger.
When the evidence showed that his cell phone was with Chamber at the same time as he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, a police officer went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said that he had not been in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that it was "lying, because my car was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said that she had known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Mobile phone data showed that they had only been known for one week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chamber’s death, Tellis had deleted text messages, phone calls, and her contact details from his phone.
“ He spent her out of his life, ” said Hale.
Guards are expected to deliver their final speech on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected that the matter should be brought to the womb later that day.

Another black person?!
Nanny in New York City, a law-enforcement couple for a "prejudicious" text message departure.
An abortion in New York City, a law-enforcement couple, because of an illegal departure after receiving an unexpected text message from the mother, who complained that she was “one of the other black people. ”
The couple therefore refuse to be prejudiced and likened to the lawsuit to “comfort. ”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, declared dissatisfied when she found out that her new nurse, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first came to work in 2016.
"NEEEEIIIII OTHER TOWARD MANNESKJA" wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in text messages.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent them twice to Miss Maurice.
After discovering her mistakes, Plasco-Flaxman, Ms. Maurice, said that the former nurses who were black, had suffered badly, and that she had expected to have a Filipino woman, according to a report from the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day of work and then sent home to Uber's car.
Maurice now legalizes the couple and wants to be compensated for the departure, that the amount of $350 a day for the six - month job she had originally been assigned, even though no contract was signed.
“ I wanted to show them that you shouldn’t do this, ” she said in an interview with Post on Friday, adding, “I know this is a difference. ”
The couple have objected to the accusations that they were prejudiced, saying that it was right to fire Maurice, for they felt that after insulting her, they could not trust her.
“ My wife sent her a message that she would not say.
She's not prejudiced.
We're not prejudiced people," said the husband Joel Plasco to Post.
“ Who, though, would trust their children for someone after showing such rudeness, even when it was a surprise?
His newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to “comfort ” and said that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in“ a very difficult situation. ”
“ Are you going to attack someone in this situation?
It's not very nice done," said Plasco, who works in the investment store.
The matter is still open to court, but the public has spoken harshly about the couple on the social media and have ashamed of their conduct and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers had difficulty with speaking bear, says a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said of her letter: “It’s hard to follow someone who reads her for the first time before being published.
"It's very funny now that we know about Paddington's enormous success."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before he was inspired to write a children’s book on a small toy bear, had accepted his actions with a calm positive attitude, and added that his 60th anniversary of the book was “married” after his death last year.
As far as Paddington is concerned, as she describes as “a very important family member, ” she added that her father had been silently proud of his final success.
“ He was a very quiet man, and not used to bragging, ” she said.
“ But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child who does something, and you’re proud of it even if you’ve done nothing yourself.
I think he might have looked at Paddington's success.
Though Paddington was a creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington his own credit."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye through the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but without success.
“ Nad called regularly and told me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Later, Nad called me and said that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to maintain her heart beat were gradually to lose its activity and to be separated from the body.
She had died a short time before, and this was the body to give up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all happening.
I couldn't lather or scream or cry, because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned her dead daughter, went aboard the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the difficulties she experienced.
“ Nobody knew anything, ” she said.
“ I pulled my head, and tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a lot of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Anointed women hang messages to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who had loved ones who committed suicide now try to prevent others from taking their life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up a message on a bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and phone numbers that people can call and get help.
Tyler, Miss Davis, 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and suicide at the age of 18.
“ I don’t want any parent to feel the way I have to feel every day, ” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a successful cook with a contagious smile.
“ He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could light up any room."
He stopped working before he died, for he was “socked down into a very dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11 - year - old brother was found dead after his own life.
Ms. Davis said: “I am constantly concerned that there will be a follow - up of it. ”
Ms. Davis made the message “to let people know that they can go and talk to others, even friends.
Don't sit and say nothing--you have to talk to someone."
Ms. Humphrey, who has been a friend of Ms. Davies for years, lost Mark, his wife to 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“ He didn’t talk about his feeling bad or being depressed or anything like that, ” she said.
“ A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He was at his worst on Christmas Day, when his children opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a shock to them, but that they had to recover from it: “This tear was a hole in the family.
It'll break us apart.
But we must keep on fighting."

Bretts Kavanaugh's future hangs on a blue thread when the FBI has its investigation
“ I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for, with a limited time and scope, we might reach a little compromise,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee was “drinking apart” in the middle of a disagreement between the groups where everything was in reverse.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his republic team supporters want the FBI to investigate the matter?
Their lack is due to the timing.
Only five weeks later, November 6th, if the Republicans fail, as expected, will they weaken their efforts to get their husbands elected to sit in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush has been calling the Senators to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife Ashley through him, who was Mr. Bush's private secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its study report?
A vote will be held at the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting at once.
It is not yet certain that Mr. Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes at the floor of the Senate, which would enable Mr. Pence Vice President to break up his record and confirm him in the office of the Supreme Court judge.
Number of people fleeing North Korea "decreases" under Kim
The number of people fleeing North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jongun came to power seven years ago, according to a senator from South Korea.
Park Byeong-seg, quoted data from the South Korean Council of Unity and said that 1127 people fled last year, compared with 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that a tighter border alert between North Korea and China and a higher price of smugglers with people were key elements.
Pyongyang has not issued a public declaration.
The vast majority of those fleeing North Korea are invited to the Southern Korean Civil Court.
Seoul reports that over 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border from the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people flee to China, but it has the longest border to North Korea, and it is easier to cross them than the well-being of the neutral region between North and South Korea.
China views refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, often forcing them to return to its homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still in war, have improved substantially in the past month.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks mainly about delayed nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This was after a historic meeting in June between the Donald Trump United States President and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work together to the nuclear-free Koreans.
On Saturday, however, Mr. Ri Yong Ho, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, taught American business clients about the lack of progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no guarantee of our country’s security, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to take down our nuclear weapons on a one-sided basis first,” said Ri in his speech to the Swedish General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "Mother's Disease" and says he's unfit to perform the work of Supreme Court Judge.
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority, called Brettt Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court judge “Mother's Disease” and said he too excited to be able to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave these words an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“ I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had ever acted like this, she would have been called a mother’s disease, ” said Pelosi of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Electoral Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emphatically denied the accusation that he had attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
In his opening talk, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes getting close to him and getting a cup of cake in his neck when he discussed his family and his school years.
He also publicly condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations upon him “unfortunate and organized murder of a reputation” organized by liberal men who were angry at Hillary Clinton’s loss of Presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, for he showed that he was partial to the Democrats.
“I think these statements and how he attacked the Clintons and Democrats show that he is unfit for the job,” she said.
Pelosi did not respond when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh out of work if he is confirmed and if the Democrats reach the majority of this House.
“I’ll tell you this: if he’s not telling the council or the FBI the truth, he’s not only unfit to be in the Supreme Court but also in the court he is now,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is now a judge at the Washington D.C. appeal court.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade abortion law, where he is considered to be a conservative judge.
In the hearing, Kavanaugh turned himself away from questions about whether he would take over certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“ It’s no time for a motherly, partial person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say, “It’s wonderful. ”
And women need to take advantage of it.
This is a just saying, a month and a year of rage, and it does not come out without weeping.
“ When we get angry, we cry, ” said Miss Steinem, 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she also wept when she was angry, but she had developed technology so that when she was angry and began to cry, she said to her interviewer,“ You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was really brilliant."
Years are allowed to express some anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from the first job I performed in my office with men in the majority, where I began to cry out of rage that I couldn't express, came an older woman and took in my headlong. She was a cold boss who I had always feared a little and she pulled me into the stairwell.
“ Never let them see you cry, ” she said to me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think that you are sad and rejoice in having reached you."
Patricia Schroeder had been working with Gary Hart when he was in president’s office, then she was the senator of the Democratic Party from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested in an affair on a boat called Monkey Business (Apapel) and withdrew his offer, Ms. Schroeder, a full resentment, said that there was no reason why she could not consider offering herself to the president.
“ It was not a well - thought - out decision, ” she laughed at me, 30 years later.
“ It was already seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone gave this name "Summer White and the Seven Dwarves."
Since the campaign was long over, she was left behind what was involved in fundraising, so she promised not to offer herself unless she was able to collect $2 million.
There was a loss of battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“ Do they think I’m getting a discount? ” she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not formally offer herself, she was so overwhelmed by emotion--thankful to the people who had supported her, resentment towards the system, which made it so difficult to obtain money and direct her eyes to the voters instead of the representatives, and anger into the sensory difference--that she burst into tears.
“ I might have had a nervous breakdown, ” said Ms. Schroeder, remembering how the media reacted.
“ Kleenex could be my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what's written on my gravestone?
"She cried?"
Reasons why a business war between the United States and China could be good for Beijing
The first bullets in the business war between the United States and China were devastating, and although the war is far from over, it might be beneficial for Beijing for a long time, says experts.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, shot the first warning shot earlier this year by taxing China’s main export products, including solar batteries, steel, and aluminum.
This week’s highest level of growth came with new customs duties, which amount to $200 billion ($150 billion) worth of goods, taxing almost half the total amount of goods transferred to the United States from China.
Peking has responded in the same coin every time and recently put 5 to 10 percent customs duties on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the U.S. customs union, and it is unlikely that the world’s largest economy will be abandoned soon.
To get Washington to hopa, we need to give in to demands, but it would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the president of China, to submit publicly to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing is right, pressure from the business war with the United States could have a positive effect on China for a long time, reducing the mutual need for both economic systems.
“The fact that a decisive political decision either in Washington or in Beijing could lead to circumstances that lead to economic collapse in each country, is actually far more dangerous than the audience has previously acknowledged, ” said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses mainly on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria is “ready” for refugees to return, says Secretary of State
Syria claims to be ready for refugees to return to the country willingly and to seek help to rebuild the country, which is now in a bad state after seven years of war.
Walid al Moualem, a foreign minister, spoke to the UN General Assembly and said that circumstances in the country could improve.
“ Today, the situation on earth is more stable and safer, thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism, ” he said.
The government continues to develop areas that were completely destroyed by terrorists.
All is now ready for refugees to return to the land that they were forced to leave for terrorism and one-sided economic decisions against their daily lives and jobs.
IT IS estimated that over 5.5 million Syrians fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million who still live in the country need help.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian authorities would like to receive help to rebuild the country.
However, he stressed that they would not accept assistance based on conditions or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins Ryder the cup in Paris
Europe’s team has won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the United States with a final score of 16.5 versus 10.5 points on the Le Golf National field outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won Ryder the cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again reached its crown when, under the leadership of Danish leader Thomas Bjorn, it reached 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was in trouble most of the race, struck his initial punch into the lake on 16th Hole, a couple of 3, and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone brightly in all his games and became 1 of 4 players to get the result 5-0-0, since the contest began to use its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 against Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, who was at the bottom of the stage in the order of the players in the European team.
Dustin Johnson, who is at the top of the list of the best golfers in the world, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who possibly played in his last race for the Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times about the Ryder cup, became the most successful European player in the race at 25,5 square points.
“ Actually, I don’t cry, but today I can’t do anything else.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing and believing in me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
This is about the team, and I was pleased to be able to help," said emotional Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He handed his country to John Rahm, but he defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a solo game on Sunday.
“I was incredibly proud to have conquered Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him, ” said the 23 - year - old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and is now registered with 13-21-3 in the race for the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange conclusion for one of the best players in history, who has won 14 major titles and is only second - place after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a hard weekend to find itself on the field, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a good game through the entire race.
The president of the United States, Jim Fury, said of disappointment with his team’s performance, “I’m proud of them, they fought.
It was some time in the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him.
I'm taking over Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 of his players play very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with PGA in the United States, and the name of Ryder's cup, and we'll go on.
I love these 12 men and I'm proud to be their leader.
You've got to take it down.
They played better than we did."
