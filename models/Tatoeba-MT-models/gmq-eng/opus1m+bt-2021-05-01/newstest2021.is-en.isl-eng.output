Crowded at the World
The Looks Like You Need Iceland marketing campaign has gone off and shouts and calls in nature are beginning to pull people wide and wide around the world.
“ I need Iceland, ” says one woman in the big world, commenting on a commercial announcement from the Looks Like You Need Iceland marketing campaign on YouTube.
Another observer says that Iceland will be preserved in her heart for all eternity, and a young woman says she has to make it to Iceland as soon as Iceland's fiancé is settled there.
However, she is in the United States, and she assumes that she will have to wait a few more months.
Another observer asks if the walk to Iceland is good, because there are no planes.
The story does not follow if it comes from a different time zone.
Egill Thorderson of Peel, the advertising agency, which took place together with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, said that receptions have been hopeful more.
“I came to many Inspired By Iceland campaign that has gone very well, but this new campaign is already taking place.
In the foundation this is about creating PR values, it's getting foreign media to deal with the campaign, and it's gone incredibly well.
In a relatively short period of time, we have been covered in some seven hundred worldwide media that totals more than two billion people.
The price of this discussion is worth $1,8 billion.
That's not too bad.
The primary market is the United States, and the campaign has gone very well, although the United States is not on its way to the country in a hurry.
According to Egil, a well - known market area such as Denmark, Britain, and Germany have also been welcomed, such as Russia, which is pleasantly surprised.
Then there were external reactions, such as India, which was not specifically reported.
“ These advertisements have traveled extensively, ” says Eric, who may have watched more than four million people on YouTube.
\"We couldn't have wished for a better start...
The pictures on the opening page included the publication of “Let It Out ” in the middle of last month.
The roofs went out wide and wide, such as the Forest Guard trails in Reykjavik, in Reynisfare, at Skogarfoss, in the Sun Sea, and in a cave by the Capes.
The directors were Samuel Bjarki Peter's son, Gunnar Paul the son of Olaf at the Shot of Productions, and captured Fear of the Son of God.
Roles included the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, from Cuba and Hungary.
Tens of Iceland came to make the advertisements, but at the same time as recordings took place in South Africa, there was another group in West and West.
According to Egil, “Let It Out — only the first team in the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, which is aimed at a winter campaign working with M&C Saatchi.
“ This is just the first phase of this work for Iceland’s living room, ” says Eric, adding that the cooperation with M&C Saatchi was extremely successful.
“ It’s great to work with them.
In such projects, it is important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to —
Explosives: Talk about the position on the labour market, the cost of living, and many more
Mr. Einar Dadason's infatuated Minister for Social Affairs and Child Affairs, will be here in Sprengisand, which will start at ten o'clock today.
He is also the Minister for Labour and discusses the position on the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and other matters.
He also talks about rural matters and the transport of people to countries that have gone badly and have been controversial over the last few years and decades.
Ragnar Thor Ingólfsson, chairman of VR, will also be involved, but he will discuss his criticisms of the investments in living funds and suggest that labor unions and employers withdraw from the funds to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
Then Ivar Ingimarsson, a travel agent in Austria, and Årnhei Johannsdóttir, director of the North American Market, will talk about the position of travel services in the countryside.
They will look forward to the fall and wonder if the success of summer is a misleading precept for what is to come.
The program below may be listened to, but it begins at ten o’clock.
That's how she looks today 25 years later
Elisa Donovan had every success in his youth.
Yet, she had a worldly reputation for her play as Amber in Cueless’s film 25 years ago.
Then she also played in the Sabrina: The Teenage Witch along with Melissu Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married to one child.
Consider, though, the recent experience has moved her to look over the way and to express herself on Cleueless on a romantic television program in the daytime.
She speaks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
“ I must admit that I based my person most of all on girls I met at school that were not good to me.
As soon as I read the manuscript, I knew who that person was, “I told Donovan about his game in Cueless.
Wouldn't want to leave the police station after nightfall
About fifty cases occurred on the police level in the capital city area today, telling the police ’ diary that the cases were diverse.
The day at the neighborhood police station began by the fact that the police had to interfere with a man who had then recently been released from a prison cell after staying there for drunk driving.
The man would not leave after he was released and would not obey the instructions of the police who told him to leave.
The man continued to stay at the police station because of his conduct.
Then a man was arrested in the morning, suspected of breaking into a company in Kopavogi.
The police also had to interfere with two Breidholts because of reports of physical assault.
Then, too, a woman who sat at a shopping mall in Kopavogi could not pay for the meal account and was called to the police.
Also reported stolen from a car in downtown this morning.
The driver of a white Renault ambulance looked for her for a moment, and she was then taken free hand.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the League of Joy - A Horrible fate of the Stars of the Glee
That teaching has caught the Internet that the curse rested over the League of Joy series, but the actress Naya Rivera drowned in California in the daytime and thereby became the third major factor in letting life well before age.
The “Glee ” team is a popular participation of singing, dancing, and joy.
The mountains covered a so - called joyous group of youths in high school, their love, and fate.
Being in the joyous band was not always taken out, but through singing and dancing, the characters seemed to overcome any situation that arose in their lives.
But outside the scenes there has been a great disaster over the players and the workers of the show, so much so that theories have awakened that a curse rests on the scenes.
Naya Marie Rivera took on the role of Santana Lopez in the show, a cheerleader who did not call all her grandmother.
After the parting series ran its course, Rivera began to own the actor Ryan Dorsey and had with him his first and one child, Josey.
In 2017 Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and then understood them.
Dorsey, though, refused to file a complaint and was let down the domestic violence.
Last July 8, it was announced that Rivera was missing after her four - year - old son found himself drifting into a boat on Lake Pira, California.
The boy was found asleep in a life jacket on board the boat and was able to report to the police that he and his mother had been stung to swim and then Rivera would have brought him back to the boat but never returned to it himself.
Extensive search for Rivera.
The day after the search, the local police chief reported that we were looking for Rivera to drown.
Five days later Rivera was found and was officially declared dead.
It is thought that she was in a great stream in the water, using her last collar to save the son.
Cause of death was recorded drunk by accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith took on the role of Finn Hudson in the show, the American football player with the angel death, who played a key role in promoting the League of Joy and respect.
But apart from the factors, Moneith wrestled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape.
In 2013, his associates found enough attendance, intervened, and encouraged him to seek help.
Then Monaith was treated and all seemed to look for a better way.
Only two months after finishing treatment, Moneith was found dead in the hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Banamein was found to be a lethal mixture of drugs and alcohol.
It was not thought that a willful act was involved.
Monaith had been treated, and his tolerance for high - risk donors had decreased to the point where the dose he had previously tolerated was fatal.
He was just 31 years old when he died.
His death was heavy on his associates, but under the guise of his opponent, Lea Michele, was determined to continue taking the participants and dedicated them to the whole aspect of the memory of Monaith and his person Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling took part in Noah’s “Puck ” Puckman’s role in the show, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the League of Joy, or all the way until he gained courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested in his home in Los Angeles for the custody of child pornography.
In his home search, there was a tremendous amount of children’s pornography, and the matter soon came out in public.
It was clear that Salling had finished.
As a result, he was accused and convicted of his crimes.
He had a four - to seven - year - old prison on his head, as well as what he might need to be on the record of sex offenders and look for treatment for child - abuse.
Before the execution of the sentence was decided by a judge, Salling, then free from insurance, was found dead near his home.
Cause of death was suicide.
It was not just actors who fell from long ago.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
In 2013, he was suddenly satisfied with sleep, only 41 years of age.
We also worked a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was a younger sister of the star Julia Roberts, whose sister did not have a beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of much government and disrespectful conduct.
In 2014, Motes committed suicide.
She left a letter to her fiancée, telling her mother and sister, among other things, that she was responsible for how she was treated.
“My mother and my so - called siblings get nothing after me except the memory that they caused my worst depression.
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of using her fellowman alone and of taking advantage of the position and of having an overwhelming stargazer.
Jesse Luken played a guest role in the events in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was a scandal.
The actress Heather Morris played a major role in the shows.
In 2010, she saw the arrival of unscrupulous computer criminals in nude pictures of her and published on the Internet.
The actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played the show and had romantic relations outside the show.
Benoist later reported that Jenner used her violence.
You can put flowers on almost everything
It enhances the development of children when they are allowed to play in the garden with their parents to grow flowers and to watch them grow and thrive.
It is also endlessly possible to do with flowers as the Swedish photographer Anna Kupel points out.
Just having a time with the children in the park is something that never forgets.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance, and, of course, the precious time they received with their parents.
Buyed a boat after a tenth grade
“I don’t think we’re many sailors who work at the school of the country, ” says Axel Eagle Gudmundsson, who spends the summer fishing on the beach but has psychology at Iceland University over wintertime —
Beach fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you are studying.
If you are fishing well, you can make a lot of money, and I think it's great to not have to take a student loan.
The tea also makes me feel good in the winter, ” says Axel Eagle Gudmundsson, 25 years old psychologist, who spends summer fishing in the sea, as in the past summer.
Axel was newly docked at Tjölknafðður when a journalist obtained his speech late at night at the beginning of the week —
“ The winter I was in the tenth grade, I took command of boats less than 12 meters long, and I bought my boat the summer after I finished my elementary school.
I've been hunting the beach all summer since.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance Hartmann, son of Jon, and I named it his name.
Hartmann was grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea, and he was very happy when he saw that the boat had his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat, says Axel, adding that he bought the boat out of three million.
“ I signed a contract with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer, but the other half at the end of the summer when I had gone fishing.
So I had the boat without debt at the end of that first summer of my life on it,
But how could a boy have a million and a half to pay for a boat when he had just graduated from high school?
“ When I was a boy, I had spent all my summer hunting with him and had my share.
I also put my fermenting money in my boat fund.
Axel is born in Jesse, from where all his mother are; but he has lived in Copavogi since he was a boy.
“ I can hunt here in the west because I have a legal home with my grandmother in Ísafurd.
I learned in this area in the west of here from the roots of my father.
I move between distances according to my condition, as this fishing area covers all the West Fjord.
Although I feel the best way to be west, I have also given around the Snowfellsnest and beyond.
I have also given to the south, but my favorite drop of gray, says Axel, who always robs a fire early in the morning and says that sometimes he talks to the moons and sings to the sky, in the isolated hours out in the ballistics.
“ The Internet in the ocean is good, so I can call, listen to the music and music.
I don't feel like being alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid being in danger, but there are times when something has been going on, but never a great danger, ” says Axel, who is lucky that he is never seasick.
He says the length of the day depends on the fishing season.
“ In the coastal fishing season, I am never more than 14 hours at a time, but I have also been fishing in other systems, such as in the rental pool, but then I’ve been on the hunt for a day and a half at sea for a day and a day and a half at sea —
The coastal fishing experience says that he can catch a total of 770 pounds [770 kg] a day, which he thinks is a hammer.
“ Other restrictions are that I cannot catch Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and I can only catch 12 days a month, the four months of sea fishing, in May, June, July, and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their fishing days for the weather and nothing else.
Instead of having 48 days all over the summer, this unnecessary pressure should be calmed down and able to choose from its head.
So the division could also take place for me, and a well - located sea space should enjoy it, ” says Axel, who reduces the thirst of the saltiest sea on his seashore fishing, but also only the ostriches and various other species of river.
Axel works during his winter class with the university study at the school Nupi in Kopavogi.
“ I don’t think we’re many sailors who work at the national theaters, ” says Axel proudly, adding that he intended to work only temporarily at the high school.
“ I get stuck there because I think this is a great job.
I hope that my psychology study will take advantage of the school level in the future, says Axel, who is also a long way away from business.
Registration Failed to Prevent Return Angry
An error in a registration form that people fill out when they arrive in the country did not call an individual, living here in the country, again in a demonstration.
A file identification number is not required if the person fills the form in English, as is the case in Icelandic.
“ This will be checked during the week, ” says a specialist in the field of antiseptic medicine.
Three internal infections were detected in the Landspitlan virology division yesterday.
One who proved to be positive came to the country on July 15, two days after a so - called “return - prevention ” rule came into force.
Those who lived in Iceland are then screened at their arrival in the country and again appeared in a demonstration four to five days later.
In the midday news of RUV, however, it appeared that the person had applied the old system.
The display on the border was negative and was not re-called back in screening for the virus.
In a conversation with a newsroom, Kamilla Rut Sigfusdóttir, a specialist in the field of antiseptics, says that this may be due to an error in the electronic registration sheet.
If you fill in the English registration form, you do not need to enter a identification number, as is the case in the Icelandic version.
For the first time, it was for foreign tourists to think of it.
Therefore, the subject has not been automatically invited to take a sample.
Kamilla, however, says that many have followed the rules of return infection despite filling in the registration form in English, and in some cases employers have also been alert to return to the exercise after arriving in the country.
“ This will be examined during the week how it is possible to make it easier for people to draw their attention to the process —
The man is in isolation, and six of them have been placed in an impasse.
They all went to the audition, but two had begun to show signs.
We are now dealing with the three infections detected yesterday, mostly due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, the sequencing of the Icelandic genetic analysis has shown that there are varieties of the Cronic virus that have not been found here before.
In the second case, the bond has been pointed out that Israel was known to have also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says tomorrow it should be where the other virus was coming from.
A total of 15 are now in isolation using the COVID web site.
135 are weaned.
Four of five infections unconnected
Five internal infections have been detected in this country in recent days.
Of these, four are unconnected, and the origin of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup sports convention has not been identified yesterday.
There's still a lot going on.
Originally on a third of the tens had been sent to a place where they were sent to a place where they had been reduced to sixteen.
A total of 34 people are sick because of these new infections that were diagnosed yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time when infection is diagnosed at sports events, and it has raised questions as to whether such events should be held.
John K. Johannsson, head of the Civil Service Department of Governors, says it well slowly, as long as people follow standards and rules.
“ We are constantly stressing to all who live here the need for individual protection.
We also need to make sure that there are certain rules that need to be followed.
John says: “There is an event that you can observe. ”
He says that infection can be prevented by the use of individual protection measures.
In addition, regulations and criteria are under constant review.
“ What needs to be done, as well as what the public health services and the medical profession are constantly pressing for people, is to consider this individual protection.
Both at home and in service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
This prevents infection, says John.
“ We need people to keep on the good road we were on in order to maintain the success we have so far achieved —
40% of victims COVID-19 had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how hard her father had to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes, so she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day, he was dead.
The death was attributed to sudden breathing difficulties due to the coronavirus infection.
Diabetic disease was identified in the death certificate as the underlying problem, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that it will be the same.
Reuters, the news company says there's no reason to fear Brumfield.
A recent study by the U.S. authorities shows that nearly 40% of diabetic patients had diabetes 2 as their underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who did not reach 65 years of age is examined, the proportion increases to half.
In 15 countries that died from the crown virus during the February to May period, the study of the CDC included more than 10,000 people.
Jonathan Wortham, a CDC specialist, says the results are striking, especially for those who are diagnosed as having diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
Reuters hid in slow growth with a survey and pointed out the answers from the 12 countries that responded to comparable rates.
Ten countries, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet reported the underlying diseases.
“It was already an epidemic of slow growth.
Now the COVID-19 has broken through like a powerful age, “reuters by Elbert Huang, president of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American origin, who have also gone out worse from the Coronian virus.
One of the best defenses for those with diabetes 2 is to control the disease by exercising a healthy diet and by helping health care professionals.
However, the Korean virus epidemic has made it difficult for many to keep on the bus.
In this case, insulin levels have been forced by some to continue to work and thus to stop being exposed to the virus.
Reuters points out that the U.S. government could have been aware of the risks that could be caused by the virus by those with diabetes 2.
When the SARS crown virus crossed in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease and in the pig breeding epidemic of 2009 this group was three times more likely to have to be hospitalized.
When MERS did so in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were hospitalized had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a researcher at Yale University, says that because the influence of the COVID-19 virus could have taken away a number of previously unfavorable complications.
“ I’m afraid we’ll see a tidal wave of problems when this is over, ” says Andrew Bolton, president of the international diabetes team.
Physicians have warned that the CPR can indirectly lead to an increase in diabetic complications, including kidney disease and renal dialysis.
As is the case with new research, it may lead to an increase in diabetic cases.
Reuters says that scientists are trying to understand the connection between the crown virus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lung and kidney, organs already weak for many with diabetes.
In this case, a high percentage of glucose and lipid levels in diabetic patients may be induced by a “cytogenetic signal storm” called “when the immune system responds too hard and attacks the body. ”
Injured cells may also lead to inflammation which, in turn, may cause fatal blood clots.
\"It's all one big puzzle,\" says Dela Cruz.
- It's all related to what's inside.
The news has been corrected.
“We were invited to champagne, and then they left the room...
The couple, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason, had this unusual request from the artist Ragnar Kjartansson, who had sex in front of a camera for works that the artist was putting up in Paris.
“We loved each other, so it wasn’t complicated...
Atli Bollason never forgets when he first met his wife and mother, Ásrúna Magnúsdóttir.
“ I was very impressed with her.
Of course, it was just the radiation, but so did I, too, find it quite impeccably cute.
And I'm still sorry,\" he says.
Ausrún also remembers this, and the husband regularly remembers the first meeting.
“ I’m always hearing this story.
Last weekend alone, “she also said that her husband was attracted to the first acquaintance.
“ I felt and feel so excited about Atla that I felt.
There are a lot of things going on and a lot of things going on, and I was fascinated by them.
Atli says that she and her husband have stressed the importance of going their own way.
“ We don’t tie up the same knots as fellow travelers.
We avoid the ruins around us —
That is perhaps why they took the message from Ragnar Kjartanssson, an artist, but it is hardly unusual to say so.
“ Our dear friend Christian Anna will contact us and ask if we can come to eat deserted with him, Mr. Ragga and Ragnar’s wife, at Snaps —
They accepted the invitation, met the trike of Snaps, and got their desserts and desert wine.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans for a slideshow that he thought would be set up in Palais de Tokyo, Paris, in the fall of the fall.
“ He had a multidisciplinary mascot called Scenes from Western culture.
He described it in a simple way —
Ásrún says that he described the work as a death and decadent late from the everyday lives of Westerners.
“ He had sketches of all the tendons he was going to shoot, and last he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating in —
Since Ragnar asked the couple to join in, they should show young middle - class couples to love in a minimal - fashioned room.
“ These are relations with the beginning and the end, ” says Atli.
Even though they knew about Ragnar, the couple did not know much about him and him, “but they knew us and felt that we were fit.
They had words that they did not want to advertise people.
Perhaps they thought that they would not get the right people, but that they would get the sexual masturbation from performing for others —
They said good - bye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but that did not take long.
“ When we walked out of Snaps, we said, ‘ Aren’t we just ready for this?
It was just like that.
“ I trust Ragnar as an artist and all his team, ” says Ásrún and Atli.
“ This is about love and closeness...
Senan was picked up in a nice apartment on the Myr’s Street.
There was a very small group of films; taken, Ragnar, and the singer and the couple.
After the start of the recording, everyone left the room to wait in the car except for Atli and Ásrún.
“ We had not decided what we should be like.
We received some small instructions, but we tried to forget about time and place.
To be unconscious of what we were doing and of what we were doing.
It was not a game, we just loved each other, so it wasn’t complicated, ” says Ásrún.
But was it romantic?
“ Yes, ” says Atli, and Ásrún agrees.
“ We were invited to champagne before they left the room.
It was a little like being on vacation at a nice hotel in Paris'
The team was satisfied with the couple’s performance in the work that moved them.
“ When Tommi saw it, ” says Atli, “he wept, feeling so beautiful.
“ It’s as much about love as it is about close together as it is about intercourse, ” says Ásrún.
The couple’s parents have seen the work, telling Atli that his mother heard the voice in the son at the collection of Reykjavík, and then they realized that he was part of the work.
“ She turns around and starts to wonder, ” says Atli.
“ Mom and Dad saw it in Paris.
We hadn’t told anyone this, but then my dad sends me a message and says: “It’s nice to meet the little family in Palais de Tokyo. ”
And I wonder if the participants in the project have deepened the relationship between Ausrúnar and Atla?
“ At least we’re still together, so it may have deepened something.
At least this deepened my relationship with the related family, says Ásrún and laughs.
Ásrún himself saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
“ I found it hard not to be with you but with someone else, ” she says, “and she turns to her husband.
“ But it was nice to see this because it’s only one less in a much bigger job, and when you saw it with the other effects, it’s really cool.
I could get a little off of this, and I was just proud.
And there was my little bean in my stomach, ” says Ásrún, who was pregnant by the second child of the couple when the tendon was taken up.
\"It was just beautiful...
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Ásrúna and Atla in the history of Love on Rás 1.
Swansea with victory in the first playoffs
Swansea won a 1 - 0 win at Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game of the team in the playoffs of the game to get into the English Selection Department.
The game took place in Swansea, Wales.
The score in half was 0-0.
The residents of Swansea received hell in 64 minutes, while Andre Ayew failed the bogalistine from the Viite Point and was defended.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, a player named Brentford, received the red card.
So Brentford played the rest of the game less than a man, and in the 82th minute, Swansea played the difference.
Andre Ayew added up the video screen by reaching a great goal and guaranteed Swansea a win of 1 to 0.
Swansea leads 1 - 0 in the duel, but the second game takes place the next Wednesday at Brentford's home.
Ambassador-in-Office of the Council for five years from 2009
This morning, Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador in Iceland, reported that he wanted an armed bodyguard who feared for his life.
However, it has not been easy for the president of the United States to command a foreign ambassador.
Since Carol Van Voorst left the U.S. ambassador’s office at the end of April 2009, there has been no ambassador in the country for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst gave up office under peculiar circumstances, but castlight reported in 2009 that she should have received the Falcon word.
On her way to a meeting with the president of Iceland, she received a telephone call from the office in which she would not be honored.
After she left Iceland, she taught international relations with Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst’s successor arrived in September 2010.
In some ways, Robert S. Connan was appointed ambassador, but he did not.
Finally, Loius Ariega had served in the foreign service for decades.
He then resigned in the fall of 2013 and took up the post of an ambassador in Guatemala.
Then another ambassador took a period of time.
In January 2015, Robert Barber was approved by the U.S. Assembly and was served shortly afterward, but then no ambassador had been present for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed, not a diplomat, but had served as a lawyer and had supported Barack Obama’s campaign.
He quit as soon as Donald Trump received the presidency on January 20, 2017, as is the custom of a political ambassador.
The Trump regime was unusually long to command both ambassadors and high officials in the Washington regime.
It took two years for the U.S. Congress to announce a meeting to Jeffrey Ross Gunter to ask his questions and confirm that he was an ambassador in Iceland.
In his testimony to the assembly, he said that he never came to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who is dead, had been broken by the Dutch people.
Gunter is politically appointed, formerly a cutaneous surgeon in California, and has been prominent in the Jewish organization of the Republician class, Republic Jewish Coalition.
The casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded them, but Adelson is a zealous supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but then no ambassador had been on the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, the longest of which is the country.
The reason is not only how long the Trump's board of command was to appoint key officials, but also that in the past year the United States Congress has been very slowing down, including the confirmation of an ambassador in office.
Thus, from 2009 onwards, Iceland has been an ambassador free of charge for more than five years.
However, it has not prevented the work of the embassy that opened a recent headquarters at Engageig.
These operations are estimated to have cost some 6.5 billion, while bulletproof safety walls surround the building and bulletproof glass are in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have enough to fill the current ambassador’s sense of security because he is said to have feared his life and wanted to have an armed bodyguard.
IBV's former player had racism in Iceland - - \"It was a mistake to come to Iceland\"
Tonny Mawejje, former player IBV, claims to have suffered racism when he was in Iceland and regrets coming to the country.
This is shown in an interview with Tonny, who appeared at the Daily Monitor’s Lugandian Centre.
Tonny recently joined the Ugandan Police FC team playing in the top section of Uganda.
During his interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny discusses many things, including his time in this country, but he played with IBV, Val, and Evolution in Iceland.
“ When I arrived in Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle as I used to play.
The team was in that position, but he also had the third number I wanted, so I got neither of what I wanted, ” says Tonny, who played on the right side of the season with IBV.
Among the things Tonny talks about is racism that he experienced in Iceland.
He says these are the problems that many black players face when they play in Europe.
“ This once happened to me, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later, I heard about the matter, and I asked my friend what the matter is.
He then told me that my opponent made racist statements about me after I took him over.
In 2014, Tonny from Iceland went to Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
There he says that he has made the greatest mistakes he can see.
Tonny had not managed to make it to Haugesund's starting team, but he wanted to play more to get on the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on a loan, and then he joined Val.
“ Coming back to Iceland was a mistake.
I think that if I had been in Norway longer, I would have had the opportunity I wanted to get, ” says Tonny, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway he would probably get further.
He wants to mean that the loan to Iceland has lost his dream of getting into Europe's big team.
Found a worm in a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found 3.8 small black worms in the neck gland of a woman looking for it.
Doctors succeeded in pulling the worm out with their teeth.
A study showed that parasites were involved.
CNN will tell us.
A few days earlier, the woman had eaten Sashimi, a thin piece of meat.
The woman quickly recovered after the worm was removed, but parasites such as these were often found in raw meat or fish.
According to CNN, after sushi made a bed in the West, cases of parasitic migration have increased.
Fear that another wave will begin in Europe
Spain is now at the forefront of concern about the second wave of the crown virus in Europe, where governments have taken steps to revitalize the spread of the crown virus epidemic.
In Catalonia all entertainment life has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona, where infection is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action on the spread of infections in Spain, but in the United Kingdom, as in Norway, all of them have to go on a visit to Spain, and the French have been warned about travel to Spain.
They are also growing again in France and Germany, where governments are trying to balance the virus’s spread and restore the economy.
Europe’s situation, however, is good for other parts of the world, but the incidence of global transmission is approaching 300 000 a day, with most infection occurring in America and South Asia.
Confirmed infection has reached 16 million worldwide, as measured by John Hopkins University, and deaths confirmed to be associated with the virus are 644 thousand.
The Most Fully Enjoyed of Mosaic Works
In front of the Toll House in Reykjavik, there's a big deep hole.
On top of it are men with orange helmets.
There is also a large tomb.
And more of my workmates.
The door is closed for traffic.
But the sidewalk is good, and there many people now stop and observe the art of millions of mossies — as they have never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least it is not worth it.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, right in front of it was a parking lot that was always surrounded.
People left there, locked the car in a snare, and then jumped off to do their business in the middle of the city.
“Variable and diverse public space — and “enhancing urban wreckage ” — is a guide to the reconstruction of the now existing Safegate.
The goal is to beautify the area and allow the Moslems to make the Weekend Night at Toll House to enjoy a better view.
In front of the job there will be a plaza, where the area is well situated at the sun, it is thought to be suitable as a sleeping area for road users.
The art will be illuminated, and now the wood will enjoy more than the previous 142 square feet [142 square meters] of earth.
In the area too will be small, mist sprayers — some kind of water slides, which offer a game and give the area a measure of mystery.
In this way, improvements are described by the city of Reykjavík, which is being carried out together with Vejum.
The water supply, heat supply, and electricity generation will be renewed.
Many of them have come to their years, but since 1925, the schools and cold - water laws have served in the middle cities and businesses for the past few centuries.
Once the street is reopened, cars can drive it again.
But it will become a one - policy street, creating a quiet and accessible space for walking.
According to a report about the Toll House on the customs website, the building was put into service in 1971, which was the architect of Gísli Halldór.
Because sea monsters reached through the house, 250 square feet [250 square meters] of unobstructed walled surfaces developed into the street.
The construction committee and architect agreed that such a surface would adversely affect the overall street image, if no special arrangements were made to adorn the appearance of the house.
Thus, the parties agreed to have a permanent work of art put in place.
At that time, a large word went out of the record of Doer, an art woman.
If she had worked hard in Germany and elsewhere, she would have worked hard at making mossics.
It was decided to contact her first before deciding whether the project would be competitive.
Often it had been discussed that the work had to reflect life at the harbor, for the rejection had been the lifeline of Reykjavík since its completion.
When she was talking to the artist, she had to learn the meaning of such a work.
She had to agree to receive drawings and other assistance before she returned from the country, where she would work on the suggestions abroad.
She was given the time that she decided to do herself, and when she returned home, she made some suggestions for discussion.
She was immediately asked to do the job.
At the same time, it was wanted to make an overall deal with it and the famous art company in Germany, the Oidtmann Brothers, but Gerður had long been working with them to set up famous art works in Europe.
Agreements took place, and the work was performed under the construction of the work of the brothers, who then saw about the installation of the Toll House.
All the work was especially well done, both from the Lord’s daughter and from the brother of Oedtmann, according to the summary.
Ever since, this has been the case with a turbulent Icelandic windstorm.
It took about two years to complete the work that was done and started in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Toll House was completed, only 47 years old.
Preparing to export several databases into a country
Minister of Social Affairs, Einar Dadason’s adulation that more public institutions will be transferred to a country in the near future.
This is what the minister of the show Sprengisand said on the Wave at lunchtime.
Recently, it was announced that in the fall of the sheep-farming year, the housing and manoeuvring facilities will be transferred to the north.
Six experts in the field of burn work at the Agency, none of whom intend to follow the North Institute and have the National Association of Fire and Medical Transporters criticised the transport of livestock.
“ I think we should take further steps in this creature.
I'm preparing for further steps in this creature.
“ More transport, ” said Angrydur.
Does he say that he is convinced that the majority of the nation want to see more distribution of public institutions throughout the country?
“I think it’s necessary to make further political decisions on the transfer of public works to land, as I was doing with the Institute of Housing and Engineering, ” said Angjälður, but he also took examples of other institutions that have been relocated to the country and played a major role in the international community, such as the transfer of Food Agency to Selfos, Iceland’s Land Survey to Akranes and unemployment insurance on Skagaststrand.
All the most important things from the second day of the Masterimot
The world’s world’s world of freedom ended in Thorsfield, Akureyri, today.
A few conventions were held on the second day of the competition.
An exciting competition was calculated for women on Thorsväll, while Vigdis Jonsdóttir of FH put Iceland'smet in a slingshot in 2014, which lasted until Elizabeth Ruth Rúnarsdóttir of the IR, improved in May of last year.
Vigdis won the Icelandic assessment back earlier this summer and has been in a fantasy form lately, but she has tripled the Icelandic assessment of the summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been suffering injury, and she did not recover today.
She had only one golden cast of five, tossed a mere 25,69 feet [25,69 m], which is far from her best.
Vigdis threw most of all today, or 60.08 meters [60.08 m] in her last attempt, and immediately set a convention.
In early July, Iceland’s record was 62,69 meters [62,69 m], and she was therefore somewhat different from that.
IR’s Guðrun Karitas Hallgrimsdóttir had the second best shot of the day, which improved its best with a throw of about 50,18 meters.
In men's class, the FH-linger won Hilmar Örn Jonsson, the Icelandic Meth Sea in a battle of battle, a sure victory, but he threw a final battle of 73.84 meters into his next cast and set an assembly.
His record in the article is 75,26 meters.
God’s choice of the Guðnason, the Olympics, and the Icelandic Meth Sea in a roundabout, won a competition on the Thorsfield yesterday, but today he competed on a roundabout which is his main article.
The landmark of the gods of Vals is 65,53 meters [65,53 m], which he threw at most 5,13 meters [59,13 m] today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjarti Erlendsson threw the second most of the time today, which had one valid cast that worked in the second seat, a hundred and forty - three feet [49.43 m].
The great queen of the sea, the long - range Icelandic meth, won the long - standing race, but Hafdis jumped no more than six feet [6.25 m] today, which is less than ten inches [40 cm] from the Icelandic record.
In the 200-metre race of women, it was the IR-ing Gudjörg Jona Bjarnadføttir, who was the highest in 24.04 seconds, while Iceland's assessment in the article is 23.45 seconds.
The Gudjörg Jonah was victorious in Akureyri, but she won two gold prizes yesterday, in a 100 - foot [100 m] race, and in a 4 x 100 - foot [100 m] race, and also in a 4 x 400 - foot [400 m] campaign today.
In a male class, Kolbeinn Hönnsson from FH was first in the 200 - meter race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds before Oliver Monna Samuel’s son from the Year.
Like Gudjörg Jonah, Kolbeinn took the Stad of gold in the 100 - foot [100 m] course yesterday as well as in the 400 - foot [400 m] race.
Don't get a fine for a $27 million Bitcoin crop.
A super-taxation committee has rejected the requirement of a tax collector who demanded a fine for underpaying his or her income due to the sale of the Bitcoin coin.
The committee concludes that the tax collector did not provide clear evidence as to why it was necessary to fine the man.
The Committee’s decision states that the tax investigator considered that the person had made an error of tax credit for the 2016 and 2017 revenue years.
He would have mispronounced his funds, which were there because of the sale of the coin Bitcoin to 27 million, either intentionally or with a great lack of care.
The man should be guilty of his conduct.
So the man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
He did, however, agree to sell coins for 27 million in 2016.
He would have had burials in 2009 and 2010 when it would have been both easy and cheap with a normal home computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the coins, tax had been levied because of such sales that were very vague and unpredictable.
It could hardly have been expected that the public would have recognized such tax provisions.
He would not have avoided paying taxes on the harvest, and he would have recognized his property as an asset in the expense account.
He would have asked both scholars and the governor about how this would be done but without success.
Then he felt that he had to take into account that he was not born or raised in Iceland and had lived here only for a few years when he began digging for Bitcoin.
He would have been in a worse position than others to examine complex rules that the tax authorities would not have made a clear view of.
The man thought it right that his taxes for these two years of income would be revalued and stressed, but otherwise he would not be punished.
He then repeated that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes on this country since 2012.
He would never have intended to escape his responsibilities in an improper way.
The penalty for guilt would be out of the ordinary and would throw it into debt.
“ This man understands what football is, ” says the U.S.
Andersen Willumsson’s armory has been considerable between the teeth of people but has also been impressed by his performance as a result of his performance as a result of Breidablik’s play in Pepsi Max.
Flashes will be on the fire line tonight when they receive IA on live broadcast at Stop 2 Sports.
Brownjelf then takes out a ban on the four reminders of the season, and therefore does not show up with a new haircut like in summer games so far.
He had been written “blah, blah, blah — on his head for the game of the HK last Thursday, which HK won between 1 and 0.
“ I don’t know who exactly he was answering with the credit, but speaking of a character, it was better to try in the game.
He didn't go hiding.
He wants to get the ball every single time and if there was someone going to level this game, I thought he would or would make it,\" said Gudmundur Benediktsson of Pepsi Max, when it was thought that Brynjøl.
\"I'm supposed to be here for the people--
“ Sometimes it’s hard to figure out what his situation is.
He looks a little out on the left when it begins to suffer, but he has a very free roll in his team, “said Hjörvar Havjänasson.
“ There is no one involved in the fact that it is a character, ” says Dr.
This is a fun group and I love it with my hair, and to always be ready to come and answer in interviews.
There's a lot of people busy with him, who tell me that this man understands what football is.
“ I am a entertainer.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it.
The people are reading the interviews with Brynjølf, people are paying their way in and watching what's next on his hair.
\"This man is just a genius,\" said Måni.
Player KR says he wants to leave his partner--\"I've been in contact with some teams in the B section--
Tobias Thomsen, player KR in Pepsi Max, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish centre of Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to get to the beginning of the national period, but to do so, he needs to terminate his contract with KR, where the Danish department begins before the Icelandic probability.
The partner knows that I miss Danmarks and has shown me a lot of understanding, ” said Tobias in a conversation with Bold.
“I’ve been in contact with a few teams in the B section and will probably switch over before the Icelandic period ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can allow themselves to pay up my contract with KR -
Then he says that he is likely to have to reduce his salary in Denmark.
“In Denmark, the economic effects of the virus are likely to be greater than in Iceland”
The biker Bjartmar has recovered wheels for millions - Answers now after the discussion of DV
For over a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had a hobby unlike most others.
He blows up and saves lost and stolen bicycles, electric bicycles, and purses.
Has Bjartmar earned the name “the wheelblower — by the way.
Yesterday, when a man published a story about his dealings with Bjartmar, he became a great fantassist.
DV then referred to the Facebook group of Westerners as saying that Bjartmar spoke to the man on the east bank and said that he could have been stolen.
There was nothing else to read from the original writings of the electric shuttle but that Bjartmar caught him.
These texts have now been changed to Facebook and the headlines of the original news DV have been updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the original news of the matter is not a description of what really went on last night in the East.
Bjartmar said that he had received information from the victim of an electric shock that these were indeed electronics.
The information received by an alleged owner, but the information was wrong, says Bjartmar.
“ I saw the guy, and I knew the shuttle, as I found out that there was an electric shuttle that had been missed for a very long time and was looking for it.
I did hesitate first, but when I saw him preparing to drive off on the shuttle, I decided to make a decision to talk to the man.
The owner was sure, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I do very well on such matters, but before I finished what I had to say, the man had taken the word off me --
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric cable has just invited him to show him the receipt and to call the police himself.
- Yeah, cool,\" said Bjartmar, \"Let's just get this straight,
As a result, the owner of the electronics proved his ownership on his electronics and left.
Later, as reported in the previous report, the court of the owner of the electronics told his story on Facebook.
During this past year that Bjartmar has been busy in his work, he says he can count on the chances that he could count on people on one hand’s fingers.
“ I have had peaceful relations with the most difficult men in Reykjavík, ” said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle skitters are most often the smallest brothers and sisters in society, addicts, mental - healthed people, and other people who are on the streets for some reason.
“ The fig is a tough master, and somehow the next dose needs to be financed, ” says Bjartmar.
“ My relationship with these people really is so good that I have many of the good people with me.
For example, people went to treatment and then approached me and helped me do what I was doing, “he says.
In general, Bjartmar’s interaction with bicycles is civil.
Some know of him and what he is doing and offer peacefully to show him the receipts, the number of bicycles, and so forth.
Theft of bicycles is a major problem that has not been discussed.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police have even begun to point people at him for stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar disagrees with the previous DV news transfer and does not say that he is an independent police officer in a personal search for justice.
Asked if he has not yet come to ice with his behavior, and whether this is not primarily the role of the police, says Bjartmar.
“ Of course, the police are supposed to do this, but the fact is, the police are simply not doing this.
I've seen police driving away from a pile of stolen wheels.
She’s simply unspeakable in these matters —
“ When the police aren’t doing anything in this, and it’s just in front of your nose, and the experience has shown that I can succeed in this class, then why not — ask Bjartmar.
He says that he has made so much progress in making up for stolen wheels that he sometimes comes across his “scrupulous places — on the street that they had only just the Bjartmars in which they had reached.
When Bjartmar has called for police assistance, she has simply failed.
“ It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault, and it’s not the owners of the bicycles to blame, ” said Bjartmar, and it’s a shame that the victims of a bicycle thief have to suffer the indifference of the police in this class.
The results of Bjartmar are not shared.
In many places, stories of people can be found thanks to Bjartmar, who has returned to them his belongings.
The number of bicycles he has returned has long been lost by Bjartmar himself, but the amount of money may have run in millions, if not millions.
It weighs electricity, electric bicycles, and electric skates heavily, but an electric bicycle may cost less than half a million.
Bjartmar works at the nursery, and every weekend he works in a community.
So his riding - wheel search is an unpaid job that he takes care of during his spare time.
Life and Long Shadows
In 2019, Iceland had a great birthday year in its history.
True, the officials had received a pension from the king of Dana all the streets since the 19th century, but in 1919 the pension fund for officials eventually became the fund of life for all public employees.
The basis for the current pension fund of general wage earners was then laid by a comprehensive labour market agreement in 1969, with a commitment to a job-related pension fund and a valid collection of funds from 1970 onwards.
Then, in 1974, laws were laid down on the basis of these agreements, and the living - ear system continued to increase thereafter.
The wage - earning system of living was not the only radical change that the 20th - century labor movement exerted by its struggle.
Workless insurance had similarly been provided in historic strike cases in 1955, and it was also gradually brought forward by the organization’s demands on sickness rights and health insurance, the granting of substantial rights, the reduction of working hours, housing improvements, and other important matters.
All these rights cost much and a lot of struggle, but they proved to be much greater and more permanent than the increase of the money in the paycheck, which disappeared as quickly in the hilt of inflation that marked the postwar period and up to 1990, as many remember.
The attraction to the establishment of a general fund of living in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although it was finally agreed that the funds would actually be the property of the unions, the labor movement had to agree that their government had to be appointed as representatives of employers and social partners in the same way.
In the following years after the fund was established, the majority of the workers in the fund’s government often came to the discussion of employees’ organisations, but it never succeeded, so we are still stuck with the abnormal arrangement that representatives of the unions are not in the majority of the fund’s government.
Article 36 of the Law No 129/1997 on the liability of the right to the right to life and the activities of the funds discusses the investment policies of the funds.
It states in the first issue that “life savings should guide the interests of social partners ” —
Also, the fifth issue states: “The Life - Giver Fund should set moral standards in investments —
The following provisions, followed by the aforementioned legislative provisions, are included in the life-sales policy of traders:
The LIFE Fund is part of the United Nations (UN PRI) rules on responsible investments, along with many of the largest living reserves and Western and European industries.
The regulation discusses how emphasis on environmental and social issues, as well as good governance of companies, can contribute to the improvement of the investment-driven portfolio.
In this way, investment interests and social goals are intertwined in a broader context.
LV considers it important that companies, especially those registered in the stock market, set a public policy: to operate good governance on social and environmental matters.
The Life Fund value, which is the largest in the country, has set out “a policy of responsible investment — and there are similar regulations.
It is all recalled here as the introduction to the latest fashion word of the Icelandic word, “shade control, ”
Since the word is new, there is no hope that it has been fully defined, but it seems to me that the following definition is now “most important: Shadow management is when a trade union leader says in the media that he intends to send representatives to the Society in the administration of a LIFE fund or instructions on how to take sides in a particular case.
If they fail to respond, they will be let out of the government at the first convenient time.
If the leader does not take this into the media and does not speak of resignation, however, it is not “consistency — although, of course, such communication is always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I let the reader think about how he feels “more easily ”
In particular, two men have tried to shape this definition when it is written, in the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
They are a journalist of the newspaper Hörgisson and Governor of the Bank of Banks of Ausgeir.
The reason for both was that Bogi Nils Bogason, president of Icelandair, had announced his intention to terminate the company’s contracts with the flight attendants (tell them up), and Ragnar Thor Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavík World Trade Association, sent them out to the representatives of the Society in the management of the Life-Employer Fund, who did not support the potential purchase of the fund on stock in the company, or they might be dismissed.
Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, and then Ragnar Thor went the same way with his recommendations, which, of course, focused on Boga’s decision.
Nevertheless, they saw Harder and Ásgeir a reason to discuss the matter in the Friday newsmagazine with big words about shadow control, crime, and the need for legal changes.
It was to be a small mist that was to be rolled over while the shower was being covered, and it was to be quickly wiped out.
Since the matter is important, consider the subject yourself at the end.
Before that, I followed the elements of the law on life insurance that are subject to this.
These include the protection of the interests of social partners and moral standards in investment, and these aspects are further elaborated in both the value and the Life-Emergency Fund of traders, as I mentioned.
However, living funds should NOT look only for short - term profits in their investments.
Such a policy would be quite dangerous, and it is not long to look for examples of this in the past, since large lending by banks and banks has gone to immoral adventurers and environmental wastes, with tragic consequences.
Apparently, the director of Icelandair was on a rough ice when he thought of drying out a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the welfare enjoyed by the Society in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Happily, he saw him and pulled it back.
Time will tell if it will do enough to enable the company’s investment to be held accountable to its corporations at the end of the day.

One of the infected did not have a chance to return.
On July 15th, about a week and a half ago, one of the three people diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the country from the Baltic Sea.
However, he is an Icelandic resident who is not regularly living here and therefore did not receive clear instructions to conduct a so - called ‘ return accident ’ after his arrival in the country and to take another tour a few days after his arrival.
He got a negative from a scan at the border.
“ But he is in an Icelandic community and is actually going to do so, ” says Kamilla Josepsdóttir, an expert in the field of health care at the Landskiller and a health care professional while he is on a summer vacation, in a conversation with the Journal today.
“He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to enter the identification number, and if the identification is not recorded, you are not automatically sent in the later view —
It says that man could have used the English registration form because he is actually a foreign resident but because of his connection with the country that Iceland should have used it rather in Icelandic.
He didn't realize, though.
“ When you’re not registered, you’ll have to look for it yourself for the second test.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that it was the right way, says Kamilla.
“ It is clear, then, that while we find some way to do an automatic preaching system, we need to boost the information transmission while the Icelandics do not include their identification numbers.
Or, somehow, make it more obvious who are participants in an Icelandic society in the registration system, “it explains.
Fortunately, though, few people around the country are associated with them, although they are defined as members of an Icelandic community, a permanent Icelandic community.
Only six of them had been sent to the plague after he had been diagnosed yesterday and were all associated with him.
Two of them have begun to show Covid-19 signs of infection.
The man received negative results from his demonstration at the border on July 15.
Kamilla is likely to say that he was recently infected by the virus that she could not yet be detected when the vision was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out the possibility of man’s being infected in Iceland, but she does not want to carry the virus with her to the country.
“It is not entirely possible to claim that this is definitely infected by the fact that it has been a long time since his arrival in the country that he may have been exposed here as these two that have caused a little rule in connection with the sports event —
Yet, she says that it is highly unlikely because of the few around him.
“ It is really highly unlikely, ” says Kamilla, but it states that it cannot be ruled out until Icelandic genetic analysis has serialized the virus in man.
“If we get a virus that hasn’t been seen here before, it’s almost certain he carried it to the country —
Piper spouts and bombs used against Protestants
There was a conflict between the police and Protestants in Seattle last night.
The police used pepper spree and nonbanous hand grenades, but the Protestants broke windows and lit fire.
45 Protestants were arrested, and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racial prejudice were protested in many parts of the United States last night, but the protest in Seattle supported Protestants in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one Protestant was shot to death.
As noted on the BBC, the assailant has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands met in peaceful protests.
Then a group of people set fire to a building site and broke windows in the city courthouse.
Then the police said that the protests were rioting and that there was a conflict between Protestant and police groups.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23 - year - old black man murdered by a police officer last August, was remembered by Protestants.
A car passed through a group of Protestants in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of soldiers came black together and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26 - year - old black woman murdered by the police at her home last March.
The group carried firearms and went to prisons at closed street conventions, where the police assigned the group from a group of protesters and also carried firearms.
At that time 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where Protestants remembered James Scurlock, a 22 - year - old black man murdered by a white barber in May.
Sunshine: Not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, head of football Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of the game with Leicester today on the final tour of the English Selection Department.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea won't lose against Wolves, end the Sunskjær and his men in the fifth place and then lose by the Master's seat.
Then they should still hope to get to the Championship by winning the European Department next month.
“ We haven’t come to an end.
If we get a point against Leicester, I think people will say we haven’t had a bad time now, ” said Solskjær.
“ But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have quite ashore to catch the two teams above us, ” said Solskjær.
Clearly, human nerves become thundering at 3 p.m. today, but Solar heart tried to pretend that every other game was involved.
“ If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure during the last time of the season.
This is nothing new, and this is where the partner builds.
We have made a wonderful opportunity to end the season well, and now it is our use of it, ” said Solskjær.
“ It’s not the most important game of the season, it’s just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our period, we have already had many hours to define this period —
“ The arrival of Bruno Fernandes changed greatly for us, and I believe that we are in a better shape and much stronger spiritually than in the last period, ” said Solskjær.
65,000 infections per day
According to John Hopkins University, 65,490 new diseases of the crown virus were detected in the United States yesterday.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed in the West Ocean since the beginning of the pandemic in that country.
The virus caused 900 deaths yesterday, but the last four days until death due to the virus more than 1,000 per day.
A total of 146,460 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
CNN reports that according to the model of the U.S. Center for Disease Control, the number of deaths caused by the virus will reach 175,000 on August 15.
Fear of the Second Maturity
Spain’s government is now trying to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the country from increasing.
The Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new COVID-19 cases, both on Thursday and Friday.
No more have been discovered in one day since early May, and the reports come at the same time as the Spanish begin to lift one of the strictest bans in Europe.
As a result, the British authorities now oblige passengers coming from Spain to return to the place where they arrived.
A week earlier, Spain was listed by the British Federation of Safe Kingdoms.
The worst situation in Catalonia, northeastern Spain, is where governments have resorted to wider limits to try to curb growth.
In the capital city of Barselona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks, and buildings will be closed at midnight.
Then the ban is now in force for 200 000 people in Segria County in western Catalonia.
The British decision is thought to have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which is deeply concerned about the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly affected by the traffic.
Tui, Britain’s largest travel agency, canceled all scheduled flights to Spain and the Canary Islands today.
While governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of epidemic, little interest seems to be in bringing back an extensive ban on exit, which has destroyed the economy in many parts of the world.
For example, Boris Johnson, British prime minister, has taken a very bad step in this regard and has compared it to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Then Jean Castex, France’s prime minister, said that the nation “would not survive, economically or socially, if again be taken to ground on a national scale.
If many counselors hope for the local resources that reach the inhabitants of a unique town, city, or region, they will be able to hold back the virus in the next round if it comes to it.
Five New Infections in Iceland - Three Inland
Three internal infections were detected yesterday, and two more were detected at the border.
This is how five people with positive Covid-19 were diagnosed yesterday in Iceland.
According to a public protection report, one infection is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He has been sent to isolation and sixteen who were in close association with him in an Isthmus.
He was a member of a sports club in Reykjavik, and according to the report, “only part of the sports team — in an epidemic.
Others who were sent to the place where the disease was caused relate to the man in another way.
The origin of this infection is unrecognizable and fully infected by the Chief Inspector's Infection Team.
ReyCUP recipients have complied with the guidelines and regulations of the still in force health care professional and public health protection and have taken appropriate measures.
Although the photos of the convention were growing, attention was drawn to the very close association of celebrating the good conduct of its people on the field.
Just before 11 o'clock today, the fans published the following announcement on their Facebook page.
It says “ATH: Parents, please respect the rules that contestants pick up their own stuff at school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do so.
Thank you for your insight —
Another infection was detected yesterday, but it is related to infection reported last day.
Says the report: “Iceland genetic analysis has identified the infection and has revealed a new type of virus that has not been identified here before —
In that case, it has been infected with infectious diseases, and 12 of them have been infected by the infection.
The third contagion that comes from a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
He was diagnosed in the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in isolation, and six are in close association with him in weaning.
Two of them are already showing signs of viral transmission.
In addition, two were identified at the border and are awaited for further tests, such as a cross-border treatment process.
Finally, the report states: U.S. Marshal’s Defence Department, and the GP’s office, urged people to take care of and take care of individual infectious agents.
If there is doubt about the existence of the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus, the same person is asked to take an examination at the nearest clinic.
Patrex Mountains says the tent area booked up on shopkeeper's weekend - Direct guests other
The border area of Patrexfður is fully booked this weekend, as announced in the West.
Visitors are advised to look at other options.
Names from the West Valley of Bildu, Tálkördjord, Melanes on Red Asand, Hotel Flókalund and Hotel Breidavik as other options in the situation.
It is enough to be on Patrex Fjord this weekend, for as in the past year, Skjäldborg, the festival of Icelandic history in the city, will be held.
It has been maintained since 2007 and has become a strong city tradition.
From an attack in the tent area, a good attendance can be expected this year, if the weather does not strike in the account, but DV earlier today told of a bad prediction.
However, can you expect the worst weather in the south, and hope for Patrex?
The Web site bb.is first reported, saying that all other lodgings in town are already fully booked.
A whole apartment building caves down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live in Dunhagaga for free on 18-20.
While the owners are looking for a replacement building permit, their business has been in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, cheapest, and most expensive parts of the city of Reykjavik, there is a magnificent apartment building on three hills.
The ground level of the house is about 600 square feet [600 square meters] of commercial space.
The back door is a two - stairway door, each containing four rather magnificent apartments.
They range from 93 to 130 square meters, but most are over 100.
The house has a considerable history.
It was built in 1959 and has also hosted a video store, the School Centre, a milk store for the milk sales, Joa a gunmaker, fish sales, and now the last university printer.
The house, as it were, has remembered its figrous beauty.
The house is now very damaged, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf. are listed among others as Magnús son and Guðrun Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús, who served as the owner of the Cities, was the defender of the Citizens Society of Citizens.
Among the owners of the Borg of Cities is Stálskip ehf.
Stylski, or e.g., is the investment company of Guðúnún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrun is also the owner of the third part of D18 ehf.
Guðrun and her husband, August Gudmundur the son of Sigurð, once raided Stylski.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has therefore little or nothing been kept since then.
Tell neighbors that the condition of the house has worsened steadily since, mostly in recent years.
On the Facebook page of the neighborhood, one resident said that the house “was not very viable in the last few years —
It may play into the idea that for a few years owners have spanned the house and land.
Other neighbors say that the house has not been fine for a long time.
\"It's a long time to do something decent about this spot, and it's a shame that it's drawn like this...
Does he also say that he is angry with the owners of the house for failing to finish this, to find someone in common with the neighboring house, and to stop this “legislator —
“Just do this in consultation with the community around us so you can get on with it and finish it —
“The legal app — which refers to the organisation of the field that has been going on at least since 2017.
The owners of Dunhagae 18 and 20 were then covered by permission to build a height above the existing apartment building and behind the house, a new elevator house, and a one - floor structure, as well as a basement.
The building permit granted for this purpose was referred to the Committee on Environmental and Resource Committee and dropped it from a value where the implementation was not supported by a disorganization and notification was not satisfactory.
Then the city of Reykjavík began a part - time work and finished it with an advertisement in the Government News last July.
That organisation was also dear and terminated the committee in March 2020.
Thus, at this point, nearly three years had passed since the initial application for the building permit and the owner of the house at the start.
At that time, the house had suffered considerably, and neighbors became weary.
When D.V. asked neighbors about the situation and the reaction of neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the plans of the owners of the house, others not at all.
Others turned their anger on the city, others not.
Others were angry but not necessarily at anyone.
Still others said the car park was a triplet, but neighbors have used the Dunhaga parking lot 18-20 under their vehicle.
One prosecutor said that he was tired of the government:
“That we have to go through the process in three times is unbelievable.
It's like Reykjavíkborg didn't know how to read.
Today the house is empty, abandoned, and neglected.
A monument to the sweat phase of the city’s administration and the noble purpose of the owner and the many years of their current work at the beginning.
When a journalist was in Dunhagaga, 18 wide open doors and garbage heaps were struck.
Playstation computers and recent television were running around other garbage on earth — victims of Icelandic summer fire.
The old university printer office was opened, and it had a large number of cats of the smell of mud.
Clearly, someone has nested in one corner, but no one is visible.
Tables of sofas and beds and several boards of fossil pages, which would no doubt be a book, came to light.
At the same time, the ladders of the apartment were open and alive.
A journalist was so lucky to meet the people of one of them.
There, the Rumens were having a potato dish for dinner and invited the magazine lady in.
The Romanians work for Ztrongforce ehf's staff rent.
They have been there for some time and copy DV’s sources that the company paid nothing for the house but heat and electricity.
Because of the state of the house, rent is not a defence.
It is evident from the standing of mail at the house’s front door that there have been a number of foreign workers living there at the last loss.
A busy employee's rent has not been part of the Covid-19 condition, for example, a contraction in tourism leads to the contraction of the building sector, and these two industries are the most efficient ways of using the employee's services.
Nevertheless, at Dunhagaga, 18 homes seemed to have enough to do and hung the job losses and the bettings in the community to the third day after a long working day in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the miserable condition of the house, the apartment the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist said goodbye to the boys in Latin, his sarcasm suddenly became clear: At the best place in Reykjavik, 1,500 square feet [1,500 sq m] of property is downgraded.
Owners want to change their house to improve and neighbors want to improve their situation, but share the definition of “improvement”
Between them is the planning area of the city at its beginning, the victim of an endless appeal and the care of the organization process and the sweat phase of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
In the house, workers in bed, perhaps just those who go to improve things, are living when the Icelandics stop fighting.
The article was originally published in the July 17 issue of the Week DV.
In the campaign against overweight following a crowning virus epidemic
The prime minister of Britain, Boris Johnson, will give 10 million pounds in a campaign against overweight, which will include a ban on quick - looking aggression, as a result of his serious illness, partly because of his weight.
It says that Johnson introduces the campaign, which has been promised Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign doctors will be urged to prescribe bicycles for their shelters in excess of weight and will also be waged to fight the increase of bicycle ladders.
Then, according to British media sources, advertising on television will be banned by 21 a.m.
“COVID-19 has raised us to the risk of overweighting short and long term risks, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use our time to become more healthy, more effective, and to eat a healthy diet — according to the government’s spokesman.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was put into intensive care when he was infected with the crown virus in spring, and it is partly to his weight because he is thought to have become so seriously ill.
Women Better to Lead the Changes
Did she say that the new constitution was the largest step that the nation can take towards greater distribution of power, transparency, and against corruption and the interests of the whole.
“ We need to change gears now, and who is better at bringing such changes than the group of society that is easier to be in these values.
There are women, ” said Helga.
“ Women in Iceland are famous for their women’s union.
To stick together and stick together to lead changes.
So now we’re just about to lead these changes —
She said she was a little apprehensive about the emphasis on Iceland that “best in the world — in both gender equality and human rights.
“ Then we are not as ready to see what needs to be done.
Like the Germans, they are very conscious of their history and view everything that needs to be done.
That's a lot.
We need to know where we are coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of peripheral groups.
We don’t all live by the same rules here, ” said Helga.
She said that she had many good things to do in Iceland, but she added that, as elsewhere, Iceland was living with tremendous male values.
She said that politics had turned into a form of self - interest, authority, and power, which were the forces that maintained discrimination in all communities.
“ Women have now formed this group and come together and have become a little annoyed about the fact that the General Assembly is likely to move beyond this 2012 national order, ” she said.
“ That’s what we’re thinking.
Based on human rights and nature protection, cooperation, and that we are all really sitting at the same table, “she said and added that the former values are the starting point of the new constitution.
“ We are a very rich country of natural poverty, and it’s ridiculous that there are people living in poverty here.
It’s ridiculous, we can change things differently,” said Helga.
“ It’s ridiculous that there is a natural law that women’s jobs are always lower paid.
It's ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses will have to stand in battle forever just to get the horrifying reward.
The signing list of new constitutions can be written here through electronic Iceland.

A man was arrested in the middle of the night after he threatened the walking passersby and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped drug production in Aarhus, where two were arrested for the case.
Then the police stopped the motorcycling driver in the Gates, where his driver was at a 146 km speed, with a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of his driving rights.
The police in the capitals ’ area had enough to go around last night and were more than 80 cases recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
Then there was a great deal of noise reports about a social gathering.
Saturday’s flight came up with an announcement of eleven noisy parties, and the police’s diary greatly appreciated it.
Last night, however, 22 noises were heard on a police level.
Six were stored in a prison cell last night.

The next free night in the house is the weekend for shopkeepers.
The house is small and cute, located in Givenry, Normandy, France.

Tues of the disease and some of them begin to show signs of the disease caused by the crown virus
In the last three days, five have been diagnosed with the crown virus in the domestic region, most of which are unrelated.
There are many people who are sick because of this, and some of them begin to show signs of the disease caused by the virus.
Three of them were diagnosed with the crown virus in the interior yesterday and two at a border screening.
According to a specialist in a land doctor’s office, an increasing number of domestic infections do not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading throughout the community.
“ There has been a segregated article from the first intra - country disease, and it is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no special reason to believe that it has been hidden in society for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very careful now, ” said Kamilla Sigriður Josephsdóttir, an expert in the field of antiseptic medicine.
Most of them have been infected with people who came from abroad.
Closer demonstrations are taking place than some who were in contact with the infected are beginning to show the signs of the crown virus.
“Now there is no flu and a memory of other respiratory infections so we can be somewhat liberal about doing these tests on individuals who at the time of influenza had found reason to do something else first, ” said Kamilla.
Most of the infection is complete, but there is no possibility that more people will need to go into the disease.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending sports events.
Has such an event been raised up as to be justified?
As long as people adhere to standards and rules, the head of the public - relations agency says it is slow and slow.
Kamilla says that the infected are virtually out of date at the sports conventions.
“ If there is no more isolation from these individuals after associating with them at these sports conventions, we can say that we have been using the conventions.
But it has not been revealed, ” said Kamilla.
The work of the Public Protection Department is under constant review.
“ We need to be ready to intervene with further recommendations or limitations if it seems appropriate, ” said Kamilla.
After more than a week, it means that the number of limitations will be cleared up to a thousand people.
This new situation could affect our approach.
“Some thought about cooking — Look at Elisa Vidar’s menu
Elisha Vídsdóttir is an abscond in soccer and plays with Val.
She is also a master student in nutrition, mother, and serves as a foodologist.
She needs a lot of energy for the busy day and usually takes the time to cook good food and nutritious food.
My usual day begins by attending work from eight o’clock, ” says Elisha.
“After a job, I go to the store to prepare my dinner before I pick up my girl at the nursery about three o’clock —
Elisa enjoys attending her daughter early in high school.
“ It’s good to have time with her before I go to practice later.
After rehearsal, it is good to come home and just have to warm up the food.
In the evening when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one part emptying our minds —
Elisha does not follow any particular diet.
She is giving her final attention to a master’s work in nutrition and therefore knows what is suitable for her to eat in order to have enough energy to do work, school, family, and practice.
“ What suits me is eating a variety of foods that are well composed of proteins, carbohydrates, and fat.
However, I feel that it is most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not to classify food in bad or good, rather nutritional or nutritional conditions.
It is all right to eat everything, just not all at once and not always -
Elisha is very interested in cooking.
“ I feel that there is a measure of meditation in the kitchen to cook and get it very much.
I have to say that self - confidence is with me in the kitchen, and I truly believe that I am a good cook,
Breakfast: Hafri, chia seed, hemp seed, salt, a little lemon juice, leave in almond milk overnight.
The top of this meal, so every time.
Most often it is banana and jump mussel & KAFFI.
I'm a big coffee lady.
Intersection: Amazingly different, but fruit or vegetables, flatcakes, pure cloud with bananas and mussel, bread with an onions, and then I could eat hummus with a spoon out of a box if applicable.
Lunchtime: I often make up all kinds of edible salads from what is available in the fridge, cinema or barley, falafel bowls, rock salad, overbaked vegetables with good dressing is a bit of what I am working on.
If the organization goes completely out of control (which often happens) then the egg machines at work have quite often saved me, and then there are two slices of bread with butter, cheese, and boiled eggs, not laying any more on you.
Intersection: Get me some carbohydrate for exercise, bread with a leg, cereal or fruit.
Dinner: Fish is often chosen in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetables.
Police/ Protestant conflict in Seattle
The city authorities in Seattle, Washington, U.S.A., have declared a state of rebellion following mass protests in the central city.
Yesterday the police resorted to blast bombs and pepper sprays to try to clear a large area that Protestants submerged and extended across many blocks of buildings in the vicinity of the House of Parliament in the city.
The police reported on Twitter that at least eleven Protestants had been arrested and that an investigation was in progress at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
The city and police authorities say that Protestants stoned the police with rocks, bottles, shells and other loose ends and were transferred to a hospital where his injuries were done.
The protest in Seattle, however, was peacefully long ahead.
They were invited to show agreement to Protestants in Portland, Oregon, where there has repeatedly been a severe conflict between Protestants and heavy - armed federal police.
There, as in other cities of the United States, people gather under Black Lives Matter, remember George Floyds, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, object to systematic racism in American society and demand compensation.
Do not revoke until after a & vote
It is not yet incumbent on whether the resignations of Icelandair, to be valid for the next month, will be revoked.
The actual vote for Iceland's FTA agreement will end at noon tomorrow.
Liney Johannsdóttid, the president of the Society, says that Icelandir will not decide on the resignation until the conclusion of the vote is reached.
“ It clearly hangs together, ” says Gudlaug Lenin.
“ There has been no recall, this must be done so that the machines can be manned.
Of course, people are anxious to find out if they will have a job after the months of the study —
The vote is for a contract signed a week ago, on the night of July 19.
He is expected to be valid until the end of September 2025 and to be based on a contract previously concluded by pilots.
On July 17, Iceland’s Air Safety Council and Administration agreed to announce an all - military job stop at Icelandair, the members agreed to do so in a vote.
She never came, but this was decided following the decision by Icelandar to cancel discussions with the Flying Virgin Society, terminate all her flight attendants, and search for deals with another union.
Then, the Society’s pilots were to take on the work of small - arms on board temporarily.
Ask her how she thinks that the vote will go, says Gudlaug Liney.
“ There are a number of people who are in pain at the end of Icelandas, when all the airline pilots were announced to negotiate with another union.
This shows whether it is effective, she says.
940 flight attendants worked at the end of April at the time, 900 of them, about 95%, quit.
Their resignations differ, with those who have the lowest working life three months, and end it by the end of the month-end of July.
This group contains about 90% of Icelandair's flight attendants.
What will take place if the contract is not approved?
“ We would like to continue our conversation with our counterparts.
With this agreement, we are meeting the requirements of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that birds have gone too far —
A vote on a collective agreement will be closed and Icelandair will announce another quarter tomorrow.
The motion for a resolution will end at 12 noon tomorrow.
The settlement of Icelandair for the second quarter of the year will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary results indicate that the company’s income has decreased by 85 percent from the same period last year.
Electoral motion for a resolution on Iceland's Association of Air France and the Association of Employment for Iceland began on Wednesday, July 22, and ends tomorrow, Monday, July 27, at noon at noon.
Those who can vote for this contract are Icelanda's employees who pay social contributions to the Flying Maiden Society.
On Sunday, July 19, while Friday before that, Iceland and F.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I signed a new campaign agreement with the company after the first agreement of flight girls came to an end in a vote at the beginning of July.
Then, on Friday, Icelandair had told all the flight attendants and crews, but they were withdrawn after a new agreement was signed.
According to a new collective agreement, pilots have to fly five more hours a month for the same basic salary.
The treaty will be valid until 2025, where pilots and pilots have agreed to fly on one watch.
The agreement was presented to the members of the FFI at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday and described many flyers who spoke to them over discontent about the agreement.
Most, however, seemed to agree that the agreement had to be agreed to keep FII alive.
The settlement of Icelandas for a second quarter will be presented tomorrow, while the EBIT Society, its operating income for funds and taxes, according to preliminary findings, is negative for about 100 million to 110 million dollars or about $15 billion.
Icelandair sent the Caup Palace a preliminary calculation of the last Wednesday, which said that the company’s profits amounted to $60 million in the quarter to $8.3 billion.
At the end of the quarter, about $14 million, was the equivalent of money and money.
At the same time, Icelandir aims to offer the company’s share in August.
Icelandair is committed to finalising contracts with 15 loan rats, government authorities and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month before the partial auction.
New type of virus rather than new species
“New viruses only mean that they have come from a foreign country.
This is not something that has been malnourished in this country, “says Már Kristjónsson, head of the County Hospital’s disease department, that “new species of virus ” have been identified in this country.
Three internal infections were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One who had been diagnosed as a member of the social work of a sports club at the Rey Cup soccer contest, but the origin of the infection is unrecognizable and infectious.
In addition, a person who arrived in the country on July 15 was diagnosed and two who were in contact with him began to show the symptoms of the COVID-19.
There was then a diagnosis of infection in yesterday’s disease reported last day and following a sequencing of the Icelandic genetic analysis “new type of virus that has not been identified here”
Contagion has been completed with this infection.
It may be claimed that this is not a new virus, but it is the same virus that has spread worldwide, i.e. the new Cron virus SARS-CoV-2.
It is better to talk about a new type of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asking what it means and if it could say anything about the beginning of another epidemic, Mnar says that, as a single case, it could happen to be nothing more.
“But if there are internal cases that do not have links from abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant, then they could be concluded [by the second wave], but it is premature to support them, ” Már explains.
Oh, my goodness in the hot tub.
Is the secret to Icelandic happiness hidden in the hot tubs?
The BBC programmers lead to the likeness of a fun video that sheds light on the country's swimming-eye and hot-spot culture.
The Icelandic Bathing Culture is unique worldwide, claiming that nowhere in the world is as many baths per capita.
The natural earth is the foundation of it, but it is also the tradition of divisiveness.
The children’s drinking was legal in 1940, while older citizens are just as effective in using hot water for health care.
Swimming is described as a fixed part of the country’s general well - being.
In the pot, all are equal regardless of class or position.
Freed by the cell phones, people talk personally about home and space or use the power of water: think about and load the batteries of souls and bodies.
A 100 - day campaign is on the steeple
There are hundreds of days until the Americans vote and elect the president for four years.
Donald Trump is looking for a return, but he still has the bread to pick up.
Joe Biden, the prospective Democratic Party candidate, has a big head start on Trump on a national scale, taking into account the polls.
According to a recent survey by the press, the U.S. record estimates that the nation is on the wrong track.
Similarly, Trump’s reaction to the pandemic of the new crown virus is highly unfriendly, and more Americans than before believe that the president had taken a bad stand on the economy.
In fact, only two out of ten Americans say that the United States is on its way.
Thirty - two percent claim to support Trump’s response to the epidemic, and 48 percent say he has kept his economy in good condition.
In March it was 56 percent, and in January it was 67 percent.
Based on the average FiveTirtyEight, Biden follows 49.9 percent per country but follows Trump 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to draw attention from his attitude toward the pandemic that Biden, promotes so - called cultural differences, and announces policies that are to turn to law and order.
Biden’s proposal, however, is a great effort to focus attention on Trump and to consider that if the election is really about how Trump has been doing its job in the last four years.
Antagonized Trump seems to also intend to bring down the Republican Congressmen and fear that the Democratics might even get the majority of the U.S. Assembly of the United States, which has so far been very strong.
Policeco told of the days when they would stick to classes and candidates, comparable to what now would be the largest Republican party in the decade.
The category has been particularly poor in the 2016 congressional elections and is now looking forward to the continuation of this trend.
In recent times, Trump has tried to scare the inhabitants of an alien population to follow them, including by saying that he will be President Biden, he will destroy the U.S. outbacks and promote racial conflicts.
Among other things, Trump has cut down the rules from the time Barack Obama in the White House, which was designed to increase diversity in the suburbs.
He then urged “housewives — foreign residents of the United States to read an article from New York City’s former assistant governor, claiming that Biden would destroy America’s suburbs and took Trump under it.
\"Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and the American dream.
I will keep it, and even do it better — said the president.
The population of the U.S. outbacks is an ever - growing group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received most votes from this group but lost for Barack Obama.
The survey reports have shown that despite the fact that Trump secured a small majority in the rural areas of 2016, his compliance there has been a significant contraction.
Although there is a difference between the polls, Biden has reported a 15 - percent advance on Trump in recent outposts.

Will the Olympic Fire be the light at the end of the corridors?
After a final decision was made to postpone the Olympic Games, events that only world wars have held up to this point, the president of the World Olympic Committee said that the Olympic Fire would be “the light at the end of the corridors, ” likely referred there during the pandemic of the crown virus, which the world is now going through.
In Japan, there is an additional year to prepare, and Japan’s authorities have paid for the delay.
Everyone, however, has a big head on the line.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the scene of the Olympic Games this year, the Japanese representatives were truly happy.
They cried and laughed for the time, for Tokyo had applied to hold the games in 2016, but they bowed it down for Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan were to bathe in the world’s attention.
The games were due until July 24 to August 9, but have been postponed for a year, starting on July 23, 2021, and ending on August 8.
If the games are not able to be held, if the crown virus is still too threatening, the games will be stopped.
Yet, no one wants that thought to end.
Olympic Games are not a regular sports event.
Nothing is saved, the show should always be great and try to top the last game.
The city’s selection for Olympics is based on the opinion of the Election Committee on its presentations.
The grander the presentation — the more likely it will be to receive the shofus.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to keep the Olympic Games in 2016 or at most $100,000.
For the second time, when the games were applied for in 2020, 75 million dollars, about $1 billion, were added to the presentation.
In 2013, when Tokyo was determined to receive the actors this year, the Japanese authorities had already spent over $1 billion on the project.
But that amount is just a drop in the ocean, depending on how much it takes to build Olympic villages, stadiums, and, in general, to strengthen the interior of the country to cope with such conventions, prepare them, and keep the actors themselves.
Japan’s planners have said that the Olympic Games in Tokyo, which were supposed to be going on these days but have been postponed about one year because of the crown virus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report by a government accountant in Japan, published at the end of last year, noted that the cost was twice that figure.
While it is unlikely that a full evaluation will not be possible at the expense of delaying the games, it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six billion dollars in addition at the initial cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could thus run between $15 billion and $3 billion.
There are so many figures that all the taxes of the Icelandic State were only about half of the Olympic Games, compared to the lowest possible costs.
Olympics are an event of scale that they have often become the topic of economists, who try to look at the benefits and benefits of the games.
In the final analysis, quite a few have concluded that the impact of the Olympic Games is less than positive for the economy of those who hold them.
The short - term effects, for example, are very short - term increases, but cities often spend a lot of time with debt and a huge cost of small used people.
Rio, Brazil, has been faced with significant debt for the 2016 games and has been in trouble with the maintenance of all the major sports players built for the players.
The figures from the games in London in 2012 have shown that only 10 percent of those who got jobs for the Olympic Games in the city were unemployed before.
This means that there was only a small amount of new work to be done.
In general, cities have not made much of a financial effort to maintain Olympics because of the striking cost of the actors built for them.
However, it is often considered to be an increase in the travel of tourists who want to visit the city after the games, but there is great uncertainty about the 2021 players.
It is also uncertain whether it is possible to receive all the crowd of spectators who usually attend the games.
The prime thing, though, is the honor that the cities have been given to be elected, but it is hard to appreciate.
Thus, despite the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy of the games is not the kind of price - paying.
Of course, while the exhibition is often magnificent and is nowhere to be saved, it is not just about money.
It's the sports heroes that are in the foreground.
For some of the Africans, it's just a surprise that you're welcome to postpone the game.
For example, the Australian fifth - third woman and a gold - prized winner in their article on Olympic Games, Chloe Esposito, who is a casino girl and has been far from being a good joke for the summer, but hopes to be in the race for the 2021 players.
So it is among those athletes who are just rather content with the delay, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who were about to leave the games this year, they would have been held at the right time, meaning in some cases, the delay of the games means that they will stop the competition before the games take place.
Just don’t trust his body to go through years in addition to rigid exercises.
Few athletes came in the hearts of spectators at the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 and Simone Biles, a gymnastic star.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has been attending some interviews in his country of the United States recently to discuss the Olympic Games.
She's planning to play the games in 2021, but she's not sure that she'll still be on top of the games next year, so she'll be 24.
While generally not high age, it is higher for a first - step gymnast.
“This is a sensitive subject,” Biles says, but smiles into another interview published on the Instagram page of the Olympic Committee asked if she would make it to the 2021 games as long as she did in Rio 2016.
“ I just don’t know if I’ll still be on top after a year more of practice, ” says Biles.
She has previously said that her body is unable to cope with the stress of much longer exercise.
Nevertheless, she is actively training for the 2021 Olympic Games.
Biles admits that it was a uncomfortable feeling to stop practicing suddenly when the pandemic was at its highest level and the gym was closed.
There were no exceptions for Biles rather than others when all athletes were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic gold could not buy any access beyond the others; she needed to find ways to stay in shape like others.
The basic formula is certainly a little better than that of most people.
\"We've got a tight schedule now.
It was difficult to start practicing first after the gym opened.
We started slowly, but we're back in full motion, and I'm going to increase my practice as the year goes by.
Of course, we do not know exactly how these games will be played or whether they will be held, but we do exercise as compared to what they will be, can do no more.
I’ve worked too hard to leave the sport now, ” Biles says.
With it, like many others, there is doubt or perhaps even more awareness that the score may be that the games will not be held at all in 2021.
Yet, predicting it is hopeless.
In July 2021, no one can know how the situation in the pandemic of the crown virus will be, and nothing else to do, but to prepare for the Olympic Games as compared to being held this year.
Maybe the Olympic fire will be the light at the end of the Covid corridors.
The Delay in Marriage for an Epidemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding because of her crown virus.
She was to marry former Bachelorette, Wells Adams, this summer.
“I think there are other important things to think about now, ” said the actress in a conversation with People.
“ We want to get married sometime, and we have our dream wedding, and we have all those present who love us.
But we decided to delay it and focus on what is important now, and it is helping to share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying home.
I'm looking at world affairs more than I'm looking at wedding matters these days.
There are many things going on, and we should focus our attention on what is happening in the world —
