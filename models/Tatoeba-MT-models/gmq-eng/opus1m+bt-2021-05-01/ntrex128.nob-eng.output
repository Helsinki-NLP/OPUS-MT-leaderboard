Walisian MEPs do not wish to appear as ‘muppeter’
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, known today as AM (Asembly Members), are not entirely satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes from the plans to change the name of the Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives from all over the political spectrum fear that this can lead to ridicule.
A worker’s representative, Labour Party, explained his group was concerned because “it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means «dustete», and pwp means «bush».
A representative of the People's Republic of Wales, Plaid Cymru, said that the group as a whole was 'dissatisfied' and that they have proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh part of the Conservative Party said that his group was 'open' for the name change, but noted that the pronunciation of MWP is very near the word 'Muppet', which, in addition to being the name of some known dolls, is also a British slang word for 'dust'.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is spoken in a similar way to that of the letter U in the Yorkshire dialect, more like an “uh” sound.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the name change, said: \"Of course it is the members themselves who have the final right to determine their names.\"
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorised the Welsh National Assembly to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation which showed general support for the re-juvenating of the Welsh Parliament's National Assembly.
As regards the titles of the representatives, the Commission supported WMPs (Welsh Parlaiment Members), but the MWP option received the most support during the public hearing.
Although the representatives propose other alternatives, to get all parties to reach an agreement may lead to a headbreak for Prime Minister Elin Jones, who will plan to deliver a draft legislation for the name change in the next few weeks.
The legislation on the reform will include other changes in the functioning of the national assembly, including rules on disqualification of representatives and the design of the committee system.
Representatives have the final right to vote on what to call them when discussing the law.
Macedonians go to the ballot boxes to decide whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia can vote on whether to change the name of their country to 'Republic of North Macedonia'.
The referendum is held in an attempt to resolve a decades - long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbor constitutes a requirement for their territory and has on several occasions opposed the country's applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum for the name change, has said that he will ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price they have to pay to participate in the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's mollusk - the cricks of the Harlem tears
“The old ones I spoke to have told me that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Adams.
\"Now there is none.\"
He said that the apostasy of the bars was understandable.
\"People socially associate with one another in other ways\" now, he says.
‘Bars are no longer the meeting places of the local community, all of which visit regularly.’
As for the churches, he fears that the money from selling possessions will not last as long as the leaders believe, and sooner or later they will be back at the beginning.
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by an apartment building full of the kind of people who don't want to help the neighborhood's remaining places of refuge.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and will therefore only speed up the day when these churches have to close their doors permanently, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both of them were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis — Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had been nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's got a black congregation under priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of dealers on 125th Street — one of Harlem's main supervisors — because they failed to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 caused great damage to the building, and when Father Johnson’s parishion child made plans for the reconstruction, they bought a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly declared the carillonet to be \"the church bells of the poor.\"
The expert who played carillonet in July called it \"a cultural tax\" and \"a irreplaceable historical instrument\".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillonet in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved on to the largest carillonet at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's has never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's in the past few months is a complicated interaction between architects and contractors, some of which are initiated by the church's lay people and others by the bishopship.
The Council of Churches — the congregation’s leadership, composed of laymen — wrote to the bishopship in July about its concern that the bishops “try to force the costs ” of the Council of Churches, despite the fact that the Council had not been involved in the initiation of the architects or contractors sent by the bishops.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of openness on the part of the bishop.
Shark is hurting 13-year-olds on lobster diving in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he appeared for lobster in California on Saturday, the first day of lobster season, according to the government.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy shout for help, and that he and a group of others swam over to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy cried out with enthusiasm for having caught a lobster, but he realized that the boy called out 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!\"
His whole collarbone was torn up,\" says Hammel, who discovered the damage when he reached the boy.
“I called out that everyone should get out of the water, ‘There is a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was transported by air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The type of shark that did the attack is not known.
Captain Larry Giles told us at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was established that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper torso.
The authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that more than 135 shark species exist in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take advantage of Britain's beauty-pleasure market
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with department store-like makeup and beauty shelf, manned by specially trained employees.
The expanded shelves are tested out in 11 shops around the country as part of a powerful takeover in Britain’s 2.8 million beauty - looking market, which is constantly experiencing growth while the sales levels for clothing and home items fall, and if the attempt turns out to be successful, the concept will be extended to several stores next year.
The investment in beauty care is a result of the supermarket's attempts to find a new use for the space previously used for televisions, microwaves and home items.
Sainsbury's has said that they should double the number of beauty care products they offer to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the store chain has never sold before.
Existing product selection from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also have a better place in marked branded brands, as in stores like Boots.
The supermarket chain is also relaunching its Boutique brand with mainly vegan products, because there is growing demand for this among younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer The Fragrance Shop has to test out a sales table in two Sainsbury's stores. One opened in Croydon, south London last week, while the other opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet commerce and a new tendency to buy small quantities of food daily from local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury's, has said that sales are gradually going to look more and more like a warehouse, as the supermarket takes up the fight against the cheap shops Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods besides food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos sales in hundreds of stores, and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales after buying both chains two years ago. According to them, this has increased food sales and made purchases more profitable.
The last attempt by the supermarket to upgrade the beauty and pharmacy departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation was suspended after a dispute regarding the distribution of the pharmacy income in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 store cases to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy pharmacy, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a selection of luxury skin marks, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Trade Director, said: \"We have transformed the appearance and design of the beauty-sweeping shelves to create more inviting surroundings for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who will be ready to offer advice and help.
Our selection of marks is designed to satisfy all needs, and the inviting surroundings and practical locations now make us a beauty-seeking contest representing a new shopping experience.”
Peter Jones is \"rare\" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement worth GBP 11 million.
Dragons' Den-star Peter Jones is supposed to be furious after the TV-vert Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessory brand, Truly.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand, Goop.
Willoughby (37) who is the programme manager of this Morning announced on Instagram that she is leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragon's Den-star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle brand in the last second to focus on his own new gold-edged contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was \"ravelling\" at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. It was here that the gold girl of television admitted that her new deals - worth up to GBP 1.5 million - mean that she no longer has time to spare her time to their clothing and accessory brand, Truly.
The company has been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand, Goop, and it was expected that it would double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of GBP 11 million.
While Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she will leave Truly, Jones Britain left on her way to one of her holiday homes.
One source said: \"Truly, no doubt, was Holly's first priority.
It was a long - term investment that would provide her with financial security for the next decades.
Everyone is completely shocked that she has chosen to withdraw.
No one could believe it when it happened last Tuesday — it was just before the launch.
Now a store is filled with goods at Marlow headquarters that are now ready for sale.”
Experts believe that this Morning Programme Manager, who is among Britain’s most popular stars, may cost the company several million pounds because of large investment in products such as cushions and light, fashion and cosects, as well as a potential delay in launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Three-child mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became chairman of the board in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall become the brand ambassador for M&S and shall replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the ITV program I'm A Celebrity.
A source that stands close to Jones said yesterday \"We will not comment on his business affairs\".
\"And then we fell in love\"
He reported on the criticism he would receive from the news media for having made a comment some would consider to be 'small presidential' and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given away so much?
Trump said in his imitation of a news anchor.
“I have not given anything away.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a new meeting, after himself declared that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a big shit on the road to nuclear disarmament by North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a “equivalent response” from the United States of America on its early disarmament measures.
He noted that instead, the United States continues to have sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when speaking for an assembly of his constituents.
\"We're doing very well with North Korea,\" he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said that his work to improve Kim’s relationship has resulted in positive results, such as stopping rocket tests, helping to get hostages released, and getting the remains of American officials sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to act with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here,” said Trump, pointing to the area right in front of him.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia breed an island that kills hundreds of people
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, foreign ideal organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s residents had lost their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for international assistance to be sent in.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it quite clear that they do not ask for international help, so it is quite challenging,” explained Sumbung.
Save the children now assemble a team to travel to Palu, but they are not yet sure if foreign workers will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutpo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the national crisis management department, said that the Indonesian authorities evaluate the situation in Palu to see if international organisations are allowed to contribute to the relief work.
Considering the constant exposure of Indonesia earthquakes, the country is terribly ill - prepared to deal with the wrath of nature.
Ly to protect against tsunamis is built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a palu omen, even though a warning had been sent out, has likely contributed to the deaths.
Even in the best of circumstances, it is challenging to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo did an upgrade of Indonesia’s fallen infrastructure to a key point in his campaign and has spent a lot of money on the road and the railways.
But money shortages have been a major problem for Joko’s administration, which will be re-election next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from continuing sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have switched to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, arrows, bows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge with later compensation in battle with Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Premier League losses against Chelsea on Saturday by cutting for 89 minutes in the battle at Stanford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's target while his team was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to his left before sending it to the longest corner.
The test went high over the box as the ball rolled towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually went over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I just tried to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq always send the ball forward as well as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come and touched the ball once, and I didn’t think too much of it, and I just kicked it on.”
Chelsea led by 1-0 at the break, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a target for 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker sent a passport with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic before changing direction near the midway and sprinted into the Liverpool runway.
Kovacic brought a quick transfer to the midway.
He then fired off a fine breakthrough pass that led Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner met a left foot kick past the Liverpool Alisson Becker.
Liverpool plays against Naples in the group game of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays Videoton in the European League for Men in London at 3 p.m. on Thursday.
Death rates from the tsunami in Indonesia reached 832
The death figures following Indonesia’s earthquakes and tsunami have risen to 832, notifying the country’s emergency management department early Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake with a strike of 7.5 people who hit the country on Friday and caused waves of up to six meters [6 m], explained the department’s spokesman Sutpo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380 000 inhabitants, was filled with materials from ruined buildings.
Police arrest a man (32) for murder after a woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation is underway after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with stab wounds at 7:55 in Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man is arrested, suspected of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard something about contact.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: \"We are at the very beginning of the investigation, but I would like to ask anyone who was in the area of John Street in Birkenhead and then or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
We also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have picked up something on their car cam, to contact — they may have information that is essential for our investigation.”
A police spokesperson confirmed that the deceased woman was resident in Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have said they're working to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment but has been told that no one is allowed to go in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents are now being told that it will take several hours for them to come back in.
A police officer was overheard telling a man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman showed up at the crime scene.
She repeats, \"It is so terrible\" over and over again.
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were behind the lockdown, while a third car was just outside.
A number of police officers were outside the lockdown and had oversight of the apartment complex.
Persons with information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimetoplers anonymously at 0800 555 111, by referring to «log 247» from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last memorial drawn into the dispute about 'rewriting history'.
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Comwell Society history team has described Jeremy Crick's publishing company as \"poor\" and \"an attempt to rewrite history\".
John Goldsmith, director of the Cromwell Society, says: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside the Westminster palace was also going to be a goal.
The British Civil War iconoclasm was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his forefather Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's fantastic production of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinions and is part of historiography to a man many people still think deserves to be hailed.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is by many, perhaps more late in the 1800s than today, seen as Parliament’s defender against outside pressure — in his day, of course, it was talking about the monarchy.
Whether this is a perfectly accurate representation is still the subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognisable figure representing one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are worth celebrating and remembering.\"
Killing pigs kills Chinese peasants
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on your south-west China market, according to local news reports.
The man, mentioned only by the surname “Yuan”, was found dead and covered with blood from a broken artery near a being on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to place vaccines on pigs on a farm on May 30, 2005, in the town of Xining, Qinghai province of China.
Apparently, he was traveling with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the cousin found him dead and discovered that the gate of a nearby pigpath was open.
He said inside the pigpath there was a big bug with blood on his mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had killed the man.
“Beina to my cousin was bloody and malated,” explained the cousin, named Wu, in a quote to Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance camera footage showed that Yuan went into the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
While the police collected evidence from the crime scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else.
Apparently, Yuan's family and market leadership negotiates compensation for death.
Even if it happens, it's not the first time it's been recorded that a pig has attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple at a farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pressed up against a tractor and attacked by a pig of 300 kg [300 kg] until the farmer’s wife managed to drive the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to the CBC News explained that pigs are not aggressive to the common but that the taste of blood may have a triggering effect.
“They’re just playing.
They like to bite, and they're very curious... they're not trying to hurt anybody.
You are only to show due respect.\"
The rest of Hurricane Rosa will lead to heavy rain in the southwest of the United States
As reported, Hurricane Rosa is weakened as it moves over the colder sea on the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa will still carry the rains on her journey through North Mexico and South West America in the next few days.
Rosa had a wind force of 135 km/h and was a hurricane of category 1 at 5:00 A.M. on Sunday, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a train is forming across the Pacific Ocean and moving east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical humidity northward to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm of precipitation in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction between tropical humidity and the tree that approaches will lead to widespread heavy rain in the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous floods, liquid shrubs, and quick and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will lead to precipitation rates of up to 5 to 7 cm per hour in some areas, especially those south of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5-10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There are opportunities for floods with rapidly worsening conditions because of the scattered tropical rain.
It is very unwise to move around in the desert on foot for as long as there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause river valleys to become broad, roaring rivers, and thunder will lead to local winds that may contain dust and sand.
The approaching path will lead to local heavy rain showers for parts of the South California coast.
A total rain of more than 1.3 cm is possible, which can lead to floating shrubs and rapids, as well as smooth roadways.
This will be the region’s first rainfall of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and last all Wednesday.
October can lead to some intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic becomes colder but the tropics stay very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We will see a clear example of strong temperature differences throughout Central America on Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of Central and East America are likely to get a warm start on October, with degrees high in the 20s from Southern Plains to parts of North-East America.
New York City can reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday — this would be about 5.5 degrees higher than average.
Our long-term climate message indicates that East America is most likely to have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
Over 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers, spread over six TV networks, then Thursday's arresting testimony from Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused him of sexual abuse that must have taken place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political celebration continued, and the broadcasters interrupted their regular broadcasts to announce Friday’s great surprise last second, when it was discovered that the Arizona senator Jeff Flake had arranged for the FBI to conduct a week - long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate court committee that she is 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh felt sorry for her and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he is 100 percent certain that this did not happen.
The broadcast on Friday was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated the average ratings for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The ratings were not immediately available for other networks that showed the consultation, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Furthermore, Nielsen usually has problems measuring office viewers.
To give a little perspective, this series is equivalent to the final game of the American football championship or the Oscar distribution.
Fox News Channel, whose translators have supported Kavanaugh’s appointment with great enthusiasm, led among the networks, with average viewers of 5.69 million for the full - day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.44 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still great after the hearing.
Flake was the lead character for Friday's drama.
On Friday morning, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras trying to take the elevator to a court committee meeting while protestors yelled at him.
He was looking down for several minutes while he was being reviled, while the incident was being sent directly to CNN.
\"I am standing right here in front of you,\" said a woman.
“Do you think he is telling our land the truth?”
He was told that you have power when so many women are powerless.
Flake pointed out that his office had made a statement, and as the elevator doors closed, he was going to have more to say on the matter at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all the hearings directly several hours later, when the court committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should be continued to the whole Senate for voting.
But Flake said he was only willing to do this if the FBI examined the charges against the candidate by next week, which the democratic minority has encouraged.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flake’s choice had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of “political games” around Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused the opponents of her plan to leave the EU to run political games with Britain’s future and undermine the national interests.
United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May arrives Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, printed side by side with her own on the front of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson has continued her attack against her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should catch up with each other's tariffs was 'totally ridiculous'.
Wayde Sims shooting, police arresting Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of causing the LSU player's death.
Police have arrested a man who is suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) is arrested and charged for deliberate murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The government released a video recording of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims’s glasses were lost during the tusk.
The police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS partner WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted to shooting and killing Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, according to The Advocate.
The coroner of East Baton Rouge Parish published a preliminary report on Friday, indicating the cause of death as a bullet wound in the head and through the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police task force for the arrest of refugees, the state police laboratory, the Southern University Police and the local population for their contributions to the investigation that led to an arrest.
LSU's sports leader Joe Alleva thanked the area's police forces for their hard work and pursuit of justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m high forward player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said that the team is \"broken\" and \"in shock\" after Wayde's death.
“This is what we fear at all times,” said Wade.
Volcano sprays ash over Mexico City
The ash spewing out of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southernmost neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The Centro Nacional de Prevención de Desastres, Mexico’s public crisis prevention department, warned Mexico’s population on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after the activity rose in the crate and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The department monitored several cases of bulging and shaking.
Pictures on social media showed a thin layer of ash that covered the cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is 72 km southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 shaken central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as ‘Don Goyo’ has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after Protestant independenceists had a clash with the police, while thousands participated in competing demon stations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalan polarizing vote on renegotiation.
A group of masked separatists were held back by the rebel police and bombarded them with eggs and powder paints, causing dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
The handrail also broke out later in the day, when the police used batons to limit fighting.
For several hours, independence demonstrators cried “Never forget, never forgive”, face to face with Unionist demonstrators calling out “Long live Spain”.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries during the protests, according to the local press.
The tension is still high in the liberation-oriented region one year after the October 1 referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming excess of exorcism, but it was a bad turn because the vote was boikotted by most who opposed the liberation.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after the police tried to stop the vote at election stations throughout the region.
Liberation groups camped in the streets night through Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was suspended anyway, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who took part in the separatist prosthetic with his wife, said that he no longer had hopes of Catalonia’s independence.
\"Yesterday we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy in getting a vote, but now we're stuck,\" he said.
Despite having achieved a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalan independence have had difficulties keeping pressure up this year, as many of their bitterly known leaders have traveled in self-contained exiles or are in custody while awaiting trial for their role in organising the popular vote and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest in support of the police, said that the conflict was incited by politicians on both sides.
\"The situation is getting more tense\", he explained.
On Saturday, the Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been incarcerated pending a trial since late last year, announced that he will be running for elections in the European Parliament next year.
\"To stand as a candidate in the European elections is the best thing I can do to condemn the repression and regression of democratic values we have seen from the Spanish Government,\" he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three men of 33, 34, and 39 years of age are arrested after a car was driven several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. BST.
Officer Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Mengas attack leads to Livingston's 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory
Recorded Livinston amazed Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
A good hit from Dolly Menga turned out to be crucial, and Gary Holt’s side is now like Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard’s side has still not won on the course of the Premier League this season and will play against the leaders of Hearts, which is eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers are going to play home combat against Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on his side, has remained undefeated through six games in division, and Chief Strain Holt has not yet lost a fight after replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston's missing opportunities for her dull guests
Holt's team should have led long before they scored, when their direct approach caused countless problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but missed the target, and Alan Lithgow could only send the kicks further after she had slipped in to meet Craig Halkett's head past the target.
The hostess let Rangers play in front of him, knowing that they could cause trouble for their guests at death ball.
And that is how the decisive goal came about.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston found an opening — Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to give Menga clear orbit, and he scored a goal from the middle of the box.
By this stage, Rangers had the ball almost all the time, but the home team’s defense had proved impenetrable and goalie Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed a near-scoring that had to be rescued by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by Rangers Keeper Allan McGregor's feet, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston death ball in a near-short pass.
Krysninger came into the Livingston box all the time and was rescued, while two penalty demands — once after Halkett's protest against the proceeds of Glenn Middleton, and once by hand — were ignored.
‘Penomenal’ from Livingston — Analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were all amazing, and continue to surpass all expectations on the way up.
The playing style and the crew have hardly changed since they got back to the top, but Holt will have much of the credit for the way he strengthened the team after his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was amazing and coordinated a tremendously well-organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell up and down the entire battle.
The Rangers, on the other hand, did not have my inspiration to part with.
Although they have sometimes been very good under Gerrard, they failed to meet this standard.
The last part of the game was labs — they only got into the home team half once — and it was quite a wake-up for Rangers, located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just smiles and blue skies on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany had lunch together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the NATO allies.
Disunity has arisen over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police reported security as the reason why a crowd of 25,000 were not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many followers met nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — many of them Kurds — also gave their voice and criticized Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to let him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the disunity of a man who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hatreds as an autocrat by others.
Deptford collation: Sicker killed in collision with car
A biker has been killed in a collision like a passenger car in London.
The collision took place on the crossing between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a busy road in Deptford southeast of the city, about 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the biker was treated by ambulance personnel, but the man died at the scene.
The collision takes place only one month after a cyclist died in a hit-and-run where the driver escaped from the crime scene on Children’s Street, about a mile from Saturday’s collision.
Metropolitan Police said the police are working to identify the man and notify the relatives.
Road blocks and buses are in place, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison, six officers injured in riots.
Six prison officers are injured in an incident at a high security prison for men, according to the prison authorities.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09.30 BST on Sunday, and are still going on.
Specialized Tornado officers have been brought in to handle the incident, involving eight inmates and limited to one wing.
Officers were treated for minor facial damage at the site.
One prison spokesperson said: “Specified prison staff have been sent in to handle an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six associates have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons — those responsible will be transferred to the police, and may spend even more time behind bars and locks.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June the head of the prison was reported to have received hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, the rebel police were called in to deal with a serious incident in which employees were attacked with poolballs.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flood (can be favorable to drought areas)
It is the spring Arizona hit by a tropical print, but it is likely to happen early next week, as Hurricane Rosas’s remaining force moves through the desert regions of the southwest and carries flood hazards.
National Weather Service has already issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona into southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday and that the rain will start late Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has noted on Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storms or prints within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the Arizona border.”
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 5-10 cm of precipitation, with up to 15 cm in some places in Mongolia Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the South West desert, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to get between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of precipitation is possible in some areas.
For those outside the floodfall Rosa can be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although floods are a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, since the southwest of the United States is currently in a state of drought.
According to United States Drought Monitor, slightly over 40 percent of Arizona experience at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa meets land at the Mexican Peninsula Baja California.
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with maximum wind force of 137 km, is 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving 19 km/h.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and thus loses power.
So it is expected to meet Mexico with a tropical storm force on Monday evening or afternoon.
The sinking of parts of Mexico can be powerful and cause great flood danger.
«Total precipitation of 7.5-15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with possibilities of up to 25 cm precipitation», according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical locust, which this is moving on through Arizona into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
«The main danger expected by Rosa or the remains of it is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and southwest desert in the United States», according to the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall is expected to produce deadly floods and liquid shrubs and rapids in the desert and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Assault: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man are arrested, suspected of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 BST on Sunday.
He was taken to the hospital, and his condition should be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
The police have asked anyone who might have mobile recordings of the incident to make contact.
Trump says that Kavanaugh has \"suffered from the shame and the mind\" to the Democratic Party
“A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party,” said Trump in front of a meeting of the people in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has been “suffering in the smallness and the mind” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of the Congress on Thursday and denied the strong and emotional charges of Christine Blasey Ford that he committed a sexual assault on her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford's also testifying about his charges during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people saw how brilliant, capable and brave” Kavanaugh was that day.
\"A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to support one of the most skilled lawyers of our time, with pointless frenzy in the field of public service\", he told a collection of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of the Republicans voting in the mid-term elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lifetime.
I'm not really a participant, but I'm a participant, he said.
\"That is why I travel and fight for the best of the candidates.\"
Trump claimed that Democrats aim to 'restraint and prevent'.
The Senate's first mid-term vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to the assistant of a leader of the Republican Party has said to CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian landslide and tsunami, the numbers are expected to rise
At least 384 were killed, and many were drawn to sea by huge waves thundering against the beaches when a great earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slawesi, according to the government on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters [6 m] high waves roared in land around sunset, destroyed everything in their way, and led many into drowning.
The tsunami came into the heel of an earthquake with power of 7.5.
“When the tsunami occurred yesterday, people were still doing activities on the beach, did not escape immediately and ended up as victims,” said Sutpo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia’s crisis management department (GNBP) at a press conference in Jakarta.
“Tsunami was not alone — it took cars, wooden trunks and houses, hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coastline.
Someone climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.”
Some 1,600 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photography published by the crisis - management facility showed many damaged buildings and shops, twisted and crushed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Surprisingly, the coastal city continued to shake on Saturday.
The journey of earthquakes was felt by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s department for the assessment and use of technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the power of Friday’s enormous earthquakes was about 200 times more than the power of the atomic bomb dropped over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami larger, according to the department.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive”, saying that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the death stakes and damage can be greater land’s coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, near the heart of the earthquake.
The communication “was completely distorted, completely without information” from Dongala, according to Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there,” said the Red Cross in a press release, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
This is already a tragedy, but it may be much worse.
On Saturday the department was strongly criticized for not informing us that a tsunami had hit Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had hit before the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording divided on social media, a man on the top floor of a building called desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching passersby on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water comes rolling toward the beach, tearing along buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately authenticate the recordings.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a major blackout that has hindered communication on Palau and made it difficult for governments to coordinate their rescue efforts.
The military has begun to send transport aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, according to the government, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other necessities.
The city airport is only open for relief work, and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Death rates after the tsunami in Indonesia are rising above 800.
It's just horrible.
World Visitors from Dongala have made it safely to the center of Palu, where they have taken refuge under the tarp at their courtyard in front of their office, but they passed great destruction on the road, according to Doseba Sinay.
“They told me they saw hundreds of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's just horrible.
As relief organizations began to prepare for crisis relief, some complained that many foreign workers with a lot of expertise were refused to go to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, money, supplies, and workers from abroad cannot be released into a crisis area until it is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It is still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘All right, this is a national disaster’, we can open the borders for international assistance, but the situation has not yet got any status.”
As the sun sets on Palu for the second time after Friday’s earthquakes and tsunami, friends and families of those who are still missing hope that their loved ones will be among the miracles of the dark news picture of tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was fished out of a sewer.
On Sunday, after spending two days under the ruins of her mother’s body next to her, a woman was freed by rescue crews.
Gendon Subandano, the trainer of the national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paraglides of the Asian Games, which were carried out earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those caught in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
\"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional sense to wear,\" he said.
Gendon told me that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding environment, he sent desperate WhatsApp notifications to the performers who attended the Palu beach festival.
However, the reports only led to gray hook marks, rather than a pair of blue hook marks.
\"I think it means that the messages were not delivered,\" he said.
Thieves steal USD 26 750 during bank filling in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning the thieves stole USD 26 750 from a Brink's worker who filled a minibank in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied a minibank in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, there was another man who “run up behind the Brink's staff” and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses so numerous suspects escape the crime scene, according to the press release, but the police have not specified how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identity must contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: \"The creature once known as Kanye West.\"
West (41) has had the nickname Ye for a long time, using the name as the title of its eighth album, launched in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected that he will launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the program, after she cancelled on \"emotional basis\", according to the comic book author.
In addition to shortening his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
\"I think 'yes' is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'\", said West earlier this year, when he discussed the album title with the radiovert Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to Just Ye — as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more a representation of who we are.”
He's one of many famous rappers who's changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, which has previously cooperated with West, has also varied between the use of hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's incoming president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has sworn that he will never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he “will never ever use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
Military troops shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, during a period when left-wing student movements took root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening several free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities lead youths into criminal gangs.
The United States should double its financial support for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, investor and practitioner of artificial intelligence, who has worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements on artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the United States generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, on its side, introduced a plan last year and has the goal of being number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we’re looking for the next major breakthrough,” said Lee.
Double financial support can double the chances of the next great achievement in artificial intelligence coming from the United States,” Lee told in an interview with the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is director of the Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the leading companies of artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop an artificial intelligence system that beat the best Othello player in the United States, and later was a leader at Microsoft Research or Director of Google’s Chinese division.
Lee recognized the U.S. government’s previous technology competition, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one will be held to help find the wise heads of the next generation.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government grants.
“It’s not China that steals the academic leaders, it’s the companies,” said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired wise heads from the universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
\"I believe that those who have a doctorate in artificial intelligence should receive an automatic residence permit,\" he said.
The Government of China issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The China National Natural Science Foundation finances people at academic institutions, in a similar way to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations handing out money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Defense Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, they are currently investing more than USD 100 million in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the U.S. law that aims to set up a national artificial intelligence security commission has been stopped for several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the North-Macedonia Republic to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia, believes that the name of the northern neighbor constitutes a requirement for Greek territory and has vetoed them in NATO and the EU.
The two governments made an agreement in June based on the proposed new hub, but nationalistic opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority.
President Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycottting campaign has raised doubts as to whether the meeting will meet the minimum requirement of 50 percent, which is mandatory for the validity of the vote.
The question on the ballot is: ‘Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership when approving the agreement with Greece’.
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that arose after the fall of Yugoslavia, to be able to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protective umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, it is likely to be decisive, because a large enough number of Members have said that they will comply with the outcome of the vote.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission has said that they had not received any irregular reports by 13:00.
However, the meeting was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote because of my children — we belong in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski (62), who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The referendum in Macedonia is about changing the country's name to open the doors for them to become members of NATO and the EU.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) made clear a small scene and pulled forward chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the vote.
“We are positive to NATO and the EU, but we want to be reported with our heads raised, not let in the back way,” says Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor land, but we are worthy.
If they refuse to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will lead to badly needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 of our citizens want us to join the European Union and NATO,” Zaev says, after voting.
He says that a 'yes' response will be a ' attesting to our future'.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum — this is lower than the required meeting.
Another study by Macedonia’s Telma TV revealed that 57 percent of blacks plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the popular vote to be valid, the attendance must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will constitute the first serious political obstacle to the pro-west government since it took over in May last year.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero maneuvers past the entire Brighton defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crushed Brighton's defense in Manchester Citys 2 to 0's on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a target for 65 minutes.
The Argentinian attacker received a pass at the beginning of the sequence.
He was in a race with three Brighton defenders before he got out on the open track.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender before he ran from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a passport to the left that reached Sterling.
The English attacker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat Brightons keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
‘Aguero is still struggling with some foot problems’, told the City manager Pep Guardiola to the press.
“We talked about him playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was lucky that he scored a goal just then.\"
But Sterling gave Sky Blues the original advantage of the Premier League game.
This goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball in Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough pass along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a few touches before he led Sterling to the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the net just before it was over the death line.
City plays against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12:55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be the trailer for Rockies
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs and have no reason to be strong.
The equally competitive Scherzer always hopes to be on the field on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoffs of the Colorado team, who is leading the Los Angeles Dodgers with one fight in NL West.
Rockies got a wild card with a 5-2 win over Nationals Friday night, but still looking to secure their first division title.
Even if we have nothing to win, at least we can play with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will be what will most likely be the highest level of battle I get to play this year.
Why should I not take part in it?\"
The Nationals have not yet announced their launching pitcher for Sunday, but it is supposed to be inclined to take Scherzer pitche in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is starting pitcher for the 34th time, had a bull's session on Thursday, and will throw away with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has this season won 18 games and lost 7, with an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strikeouts on 220 2/3 rounds.
Trump People's Assembly in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he talked about the importance of the Republicans voting in the interim elections.
“ Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not a participant, but I'm a participant, that's why I'm going around fighting for the best candidates,\" he said.
Trump continued, \"You see this cruel, cruel group of radical democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power back at all costs, where you see the shame and the shame.
They do not care who they harm, who they will overtake for power and control, that is what they will have, power and control, and we will not give it to them.\"
The Democrats, he said, aim to 'resist and hinder'.
He said, \"You see it over the last four days,\" and he called the Democrats \"no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
He referred to the Senate Court Committee and mentioned the democratic senator Diane Feinstein by name, on which the audience curved loudly.
\"Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Um, um, what.
No, but I expect one -- it was very bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen.\"
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They do not tolerate people who express their opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a long line of Labour MEPs who have been told that we are not welcome just because we say what we mean.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti - Semiticism.
In my case, I was to be censored because I did not agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of having responsible economic policies, about national security, about Europe — ironically similar to those of which Jeremy disagreed with former leaders.
The release for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday nights have been exactly this.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the mood for many of the meetings, and the promise of “mightyer, kinder” politics is long forgotten if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that different opinions are not allowed in the workers’ party, and all opinions are judged on whether they are acceptable to party management.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues I previously thought I shared many political positions with suddenly began to expect me to take a U-turn and stand for opinions I had never previously agreed with, either on national security or on the EU's internal market.
When I speak publicly — and that has nothing to say about what I say — I receive a wealth of bad reports on social media that demand my resignation, condemn central politics, and tell me that I should not be in Labour.
And I'm not the only one who's been through this.
I know that I am happier than any of my colleagues, because the comments I usually receive are political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they encounter a sea that gender discrimination and racist comments every day, but never allow themselves to be oppressed.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how gross scalding has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the workers' party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to everyone, and every mistrust proposal and every change in the electoral rules is narrowing the party.
I have received many advice in the last two years, where I am encouraged to keep my head low and not raise my voice so much, because it will “make everything better”.
But that's not why I got involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government that had led to my classroom at the public school I attended literally falling, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, both as local councillor and as Minister of Government.
I have never hidden my political opinions, nor in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have misunderstood my political views or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who put forward the proposal for a representative on Friday, I would just like to say that since this country is racing our way towards a Brexit that will harm individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot understand and understand the desire to waste my time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum - it is to those I represent, whether they are Labour Members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of denunciation or political uncompromising will prevent me from doing what I think best takes care of your interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr rises to the top
Two late attempts have changed the end result a little, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this fantastic entertaining Tennent's Championship game.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated of the ten.
Finally, their superior defenses were as much as their ability to use the opportunities that led to the home team’s losing victory, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be satisfied.
\"We have been challenged in our battles so far and are still undefeated, so I must be pleased with that,\" he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: \"All honour to Ayr, they were better at using the possibilities than we were.\"
Grant Anderson's 14-minute experiment, with a target park from Frazier Climo, gave Ayr management, but a yellow card to Scotland's Captain Rory Hughes, borrowed from the Warriors, let Melrose equalize the position, and Jason Baggot performed an attempt without a target park.
Climo strengthened Ayr's management with a penalty park before he, just before the break, scored and the target park a solo attempt to change the position to 17-5 at the time of the break.
But Melrose started the second half strongly, and Patrick Anderson's experiment, with a target park from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This was a longer stay in connection with a serious damage to Ruaridh Knott, carried out on a stretcher, and from the relaunch, Ayr was even more sworn to an attempt by Stafford McDowell, with a target park from Climo.
Ayr's operating captain, Blain Macpherson, was then given a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having an extra man on the track to the fullest with an effort from Bruce Colvine without a target park, at the end of a high - pressure period.
However, the homemaker came back strong, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for dealing with Climo when he didn't have the ball, MacPherson performed a touchdown at the instigation behind the emerging Ayr maul.
Climo performed a target park, as he did again almost completely from the start, after Kyle Rowe acquired David Armstrong's boxing kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry off for the fifth attempt of the home team.
Still Game star is ready for a new career in the restaurant business
It seems that Still Game star Ford Kieran is on his way into the serving business - it was recently discovered that he is named as director of a restaurant company with award.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays on the popular BBC program, which he writes script for and plays along with his long-term comedy partner, Greg Hemhill.
The Duen has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is now planning life after Craiglang.
According to government records, he's the director of Akakmorn Limited.
The actor would not comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow’s “living restaurant business”.
«The sea is ours» Bolivia, a country without a coastline, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
Seamen patrol a rigged marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a sea blue flag.
Marine Bases from Lake Titicacas of Amazon are decorated with the motto: “We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to regain it.\"
The whole Indian state of Bolivia has still freshened in memory the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 1800s, and it yearns for once again to sail on the Pacific.
These hopes may be greater than they have been in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of discussion.
“Bolivia has a driving force, a Community spirit and peace of mind, and naturally awaits the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ruling of the International Court of Justice on a big screen in many different parts of the country, hoping that the Hague Court will give its ruling in favor of Bolivia’s claim that Chile — after decades of sporadic negotiations — is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia its own exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president, who faces a controversial re-election campaign next year, has also invested a lot on Monday’s verdict.
“We are very close to a return to the Pacific,” he promised late August.
But some analysts believe that the court would hardly take Bolivia’s side and that very little would change if it had.
The UN agency, which was held in the Netherlands, has no authority to give away Chilean rural areas and has suggested that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court comes only six months after the last arguments were heard indicates that the case was ‘not complicated’, according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than have promoted Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have actually made things worse.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” said Zárate.
She believes that Morales' antagonistic rhetoric has wiped out any remaining goodwill on Chile's side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at one point or another, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative of The Hague, rejected the theory that the court’s decision came exceptionally quickly.
According to him, Monday will give Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to open up a new generation of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “set an end to 139 years of disagreement, in favour of both parties”.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - has used the maritime situation as a political cover.
\"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific\", he added.
“Knowledge is an opportunity to see what we must do to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless they can trust the United States of America.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never arm its nuclear weapons unless they can trust American authorities.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to observe their promises during a meeting between the leaders of the two conflicting countries in Singapore.
These comments will be made at the same time as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be ready to initiate the locked nuclear diplomat, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a “desirable dream” that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition against is a declaration that ends the Korean War will ever force North Korea to its knees.
The US authorities are sceptical about accepting the declaration without Pyongyang’s first taking significant disarmament measures.
Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, both want a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt as to whether Pyongyang really plans to let go of an Arsenal country probably considers the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest in a huge head covering, which is headed for a clothing store near you.
If you want any large additions to the hat collection or completely hide from the sun, you no longer need to look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a selection of strange, oversized head coverings as part of their SS19 collection at the catwalk, which impressed the motels at the Moteuka in Paris.
Very impractical hats have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
Valentino’s most startling garment was an exaggerated beige hat adorned with a featherlike wide bra that drowned the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a wizard’s hat, or even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had restored lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the last screams.
One creation reminded me of diving equipment, including snoring and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream in biscuits.
And if you're looking for even more big fashion accessories, you're lucky.
Style experts predict that these huge hats may be headed for a clothing store near you.
The oversized hats come straight into the heels of the “La Bomba”, the straw hat with a half-meter-wide strap that has been seen on everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratakowski.
The cool mark behind the very opaque hat that dominated social media has now sent down another great creation of the catwalk — a straw beach bag almost as big as the bathing suit model carrying it.
The orange electrofia bag, which is bordered with electrofia frizzs and supplemented with a white leather handle, was the most eye-catching creation in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the Moteuka in Paris.
\"I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the clothing shops next summer,\" said Luke Armitage, \"when the designer has had such a big impact, it will be difficult to overlook the demand for oversized accessories.\"
John Edward: Language skills are crucial for world citizens
Scotland's free schools are still showing academic excellence, and this has persisted in 2018 with another one year of excellent graduation results. These are supported by individual and common success in sports, art, music and other social measures.
These schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (the Council of Free Schools), have more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, working hard to deliver the very best school experience to both students and parents.
Free schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and their position as world citizens.
As an educational body capable of designing and implementing a tailor - made school curriculum, we see modern languages as still a popular and sought - after school election.
Nelson Mandela said: \"If you speak to a man in a language he understands, his words will reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words will reach his heart.\"
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot stick to English only when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's graduation results, we see that languages are at the top of the table with the highest headage rates from free schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign - language students received the A degree.
The data collected from the 74 member schools of the Finnish Schools showed that 72 percent of students received the A degree in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French, and 63 percent of Spanish received A.
This illustrates the fact that high schooling in Scotland supports foreign languages that will undoubtedly be needed in the future as a crucial skill for children and young people.
Language as a specialist choice is now valued at the same level as real science, technology, engineering and mathematics at the curriculum of open schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that the causes of employers ’ problems with the possession of a vacancy could be attributed to a 17 percent lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly important in clarifying young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities demand language skills, these skills become crucial in a globalized world.
If you have learned a second language, these lifelong skills will bring real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey by more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language that was a two-digit number of participants (15 percent) could speak.
This is why investment in language learning is now crucial for today’s children.
Learning more languages, especially those related to emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland, each school teaches different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages that are considered most valuable to Britain on the way to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever interests your child, there will always be a choice of languages to choose from in high school, with teachers who are experts in this field.
Scottish Free Schools aim to create a learning environment that will prepare the children and equip them with the knowledge and abilities they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be denied in today’s global business environment that languages are still crucial for the country’s future, and this must be reflected in teaching.
Modern languages should in fact be considered ‘international communication capacity’.
Free schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and the distinction for Scotland’s young people.
I faut bien le faire.

LeBron's having his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost against fans who want to see LeBron James play for Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's first season opening game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes to play is still not decided.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” said Walton on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for Lakers' six-game pre-season plan.
\"I don't need pre-song games at this stage of my career,\" he replied.
Time of Trump’s Western Virginia Summit, YouTube channel
The President is starting a series of election meetings tonight Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five planned public meetings of Trump during the next week, including stops in cities where he has much support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote for his chosen Supreme Court candidate is on hold, Trump aims to obtain support for the forthcoming middle-elections, since the Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when the voters go to the ballot boxes in November.
When is the West Virginia Trump meeting tonight, and how can it be seen online?
The Trump People's Meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to start at 19:00 E.T. tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see the Trump People's Meeting in West Virginia on the web below via direct streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's hearings for the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is charged with sexual abuse, and an expected confirmation vote has been suspended for up to one week while the FBI is investigating the case.
With the main objective of all these popular meetings, support for Republicans facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump has therefore said that during the next few weeks these five assembly meetings aim to ‘incite volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives’, according to Reuters.
\"Congression control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we move towards a busy campaign season\", Reuters was told by a campaign person for Trump who did not want to be named.
The night’s public meeting, scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, may attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by the Pittsburgh press”, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is after the polls.
“It’s a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a boost on the polls,” said Simon Haeder, an expert on political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team The United States shows the spirit of struggle to keep their faith as they enter the single game of Sunday
After three unilateral sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes may have been just what this year's Ryder Cup needed.
The Momentum’s swinging pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, yet something the players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
And where do they think the momentum is now?
“They led with six points and now there are four, so we bear it with us as a little momentum,” said Jordan Spieth when he left the track for the day.
Europe will naturally have the advantage - they lead with four points and there are 12 left to play for.
But as Spieth says, the Americans feel a little wind in the sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent games from tea to green, and leads by example.
The deep screams of celebration were raised as his round continued and sank to a decisive putting in order to raise the match to a draw when he and Thomas lay two below after two.
His putting, who won them the 15th match, was met with a similar scream — of the kind that shows that he still does not believe that the American team is hopeless.
“We really just have to put all the clusters on and focus on our own game,” said Spieth.
That's all each of these players have now.
Eighteen holes to make an impression.
The only players who scored more than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who undoubtedly are Ryder Cup’s great success story.
Europe's unusual but glorious couples have four out of four and don't set a foot wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who avoided a bogey Saturday afternoon and also avoided Bogey’s Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the lively crowd make it clear that they are Sunday’s biggest competitors, and there are no other players either who will see a European victory as the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
I'd prefer both of them in each other's holes at the same time.
It is still too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were easy to pick up with Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero when he was partnering with Alex Noren.
After one bogey and two double during the first nine holes, the Spanish and Swedish lay so far behind that they did not have the nubbese to catch the lead.
But on Sunday, there's no help.
Fourballs and Foursomes are very interesting to watch closely because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can turn around in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is far ahead of the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the Team United States has the fighting spirit of some, especially in the United States, has missed.
Europe is leading 10-6 at the start of the last day in Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong head start at the start of Ryder Cup's last day, after completing Sunday's four-ball and four-somes games with 10-6 leading towards the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led on with two wins against a broken Tiger Woods, and raised their score for Le Golf National so far to four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjørn, who fights to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's unfortunate side in the morning Four Balls and won the 3-1 series.
The United States gave more resistance in the foursomes and won two games, but they didn't get any of the lead back.
Jim Furyk's side has to get eight points from Sunday's 12 single games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to get four points in a row, and he and Molinari — all of whom have been nicknamed “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend — are the only couple that have received four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup’s history.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in four-ball, they worked seamlessly to break down Woods and the U.S. rookie Bryson Dechambeau with even more reprehensible 5&4.
Woods, who held through two games on Saturday, flashed among themselves, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested in the morning four-balls, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in the four-somes and performed a 2&1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked number one and three on a world-wide basis.
But Europe did not get everything they wanted on this hot day with light breeze southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won Major's three times, set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard-on 2/3-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-balls, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4/3/3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Just twice in Ryder Cup’s history, a team has managed to get in after a four point lead at the start of the single game, but as current holders only Furyk’s side needs to obtain a draw to keep the trophy.
But after two days of the second best, they do not seem to be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea will “in no way” agree to unilateral disarmament without confidence
The Secretary of State of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthened the mistrust of the United States and that the country will by no means agree to unilaterally release its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation’s annual General Assembly that North Korea has carried out “significant goodwill” over the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test area and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We haven’t, however, seen any equivalent response from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will under no circumstances unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints on Washington's opposition to a gradual nuclear disarmament, where North Korea is rewarded for gradual disarmament steps, but his statement was important because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on 12 June, at the very first meeting of a sitting president of the United States and a North Korean leader, where Kim promised to work against “atomic disarmament of the Korean Peninsula”, while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has called for a formal closure of the Korean war that took place from 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first release its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to reduce strict international sanctions against North Korea.
‘USA insists on ‘atomic disarmament first’, raising pressure through sanctions to achieve its objective by force, and even resisting ‘the declaration of the end of the war’’, says Ri.
“The belief that penalties can force us into our knees is a dream for people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continued penalties create further mistrust.\"
Did not mention plans for a second encounter between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader stressed in front of the U.N. earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae in the last five months, adding: “If the other party to this disarmament case were South Korea, rather than the United States, would not have been as locked up as it is.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on mainland U.S. with North Korea rockets was inevitable after \"Mr. Evil President\" Trump called Kim a \"racettman\" on a suicide mission.
After threatening to ‘fully destroy’ by North Korea last year, Trump stood ahead of the United Nations this year and praised Kim for being brave enough to take disarmament steps, but said that much work is still left, and the sanctions must remain until North Korea is nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he did not have a time frame for this, saying that ‘It does not matter if it takes two years, three years or five months’.
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the actions undertaken.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that \"The sanctions imposed by the Security Council must still be enforced heavily and without exception until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament.\"
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to close the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and missile weapons programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and afterward said that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that they had prospered, but only hours after accused North Korea of having made “ gangsta demands”.
North Korea committed itself at a meeting with Moon this month to lay down a missile area and a nuclear weapon facility if the United States of America took similar action.
He said Kim had said that these “equivalent measures” he wants were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalise his relationship with Washington.
Harvard Students Course to Get Enough Rest
A new Harvard University course this year will help students to get more sleep by dealing with the growing unculture of pulverizing their way through the night with reactors like fuel.
One academic found that students at the world’s best university often did not know how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course, which he thinks is the first of his kind in the United States.
He started the course after he gave a talk about the effect of lack of sleep on learning.
After this talk, a girl came to me and said, \"Why has no one said this before?\"
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and it surprised me,\" he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains how important it is for students to have good sleep habits in order to be able to perform academic and sportingly and for the general state of life.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and CEO of the University's Health Services, said that the university decided to start the course after they saw that the students suffered from severe lack of sleep.
The course, which lasts one hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a room in a dormitory, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, jogging shoes and books and hear about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is influenced by lack of sleep and how important it is with a sleep routine.
In another part, participants are told how prolonged lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of campus with interactive icons makes participants reflect on their own daily routine.
“We are aware that this will not change the conduct of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this, just as you have the right to know about the risk of smoking,\" said Professor Czeisler.
There is still some pride in being able to poke all night, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on the students led to sleep shortages being a growing problem.
Enough sleep and good sleep should be the student’s “secret weapon” against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said — even as a means of weight gain, since lack of sleep puts the brain in hunger mode, which leads to constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course, took one of the classes to the professor last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course inspired him to work for a course available for the entire campus.
Next step, he hopes, is to ask all the master students to take a similar study program before they are enrolled at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students put on an alarm for when they were going to lie down as well as for when they were getting up, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic monitors and LED lights, which type of light can interfere with the rhythm of the day and lead to sleep difficulties.
Livington 1 -0 Rangers: Measure Menga beats out Gerrard's men
The Rangers probably suffered a loss when Dolly Mengas targets, Steven Gerrard's team hit the Livingston.
The Ibrox page wanted its first victory since February's win 4-1 on St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss of 18 games as manager and left his eight points from the Ladbrokes Premiery leaders of Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, and Rangers could never equalize.
The Rangers now fall to the sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to the third and is behind the Hibernian on target.
There may be more trouble with the Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an item was thrown away from the public.
Gerrard made eight shifts on the team, which swept past Ayr and into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 who made a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been pleased with how his well - trained team beat the opponents.
Rangers may have had the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should have scored only two minutes into the game when Menga's first care sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle-player missed the chance.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot at the finish line.
Rangers took control, but it looked like their game was leaning more on hope than on belief in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have a prison park after 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless crashed, but Judge Steven Thomson refused this.
Rangers only scored two shots in the first place, but a former Ibrox goalie Liam Kelly didn't get into any trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's head and a silent kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livis's opening for 34 minutes may have been against the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort.
Again, Rangers couldn't handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who held his head cold when he selected Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent in the pause, and the player exchange gave immediate results when the wingman sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get the away players to play just the kind of game they like, as Lithgow and Halkett picked up long ball after long ball.
Holt's side might have pulled the lead last time, but McGregor stood up against Jacobs before the Lithgow head from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton probably had a late demand for a punishment park as he got into conflict with Jacob's, but once again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geigereller
And now a page from the “Sunday Morning” calendar: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day of the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the device we today know as the geiger counter.
The Geigereller has been an important part of science since then, and also became part of popular culture via the 1950 Bells of Coronado film, with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man, what is it?
Rogers: \"It is a geigereller; it finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you touch these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals emit.»
Evans: \"Let it make a noise now.\"
His Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention he gave his name to lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach your immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory
Cells can now ‘see’ a protein common in many cancers, then inject into the patient again
A test vaccine has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who received the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells, experienced the disappearance of her egg cancer for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can ‘see’ a protein called HER2, which is typical of many cancers, and then inject these cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland said: “The results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 ‘reduces the growth of different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure, in which immune cells were taken from the patient and trained to address cancer cells, has been effective in treating a type of leukaemia.

Kanye West was built in a studio on Saturday Night Live after a fascinating performance in which he praised American president Donald Trump and said he was going to run for office in 2020.
After presenting his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Against Hat, he went out against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
“It happens so often that I talk to a white person, and he says, “How can you like Trump, is he racist?”
If I was afraid of racism, I would have moved out of the United States a long time ago,' he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Jewish Committee for the charges of sexual abuse that Christine Blasey Ford promoted.
Even though it was not broadcast, the recording of West was uploaded into social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock wanted to ridicule West by putting out the tape.
West also complained to the audience that he heard it in the back of the room regarding the choice of head covering.
“They bullied me.
They said, \"Don't go out there with that hat on.\"
They bullied me!
And then they said I don't understand what the reality is,\" said Washington Examiner.
West continued: \"Do you want me to understand what the reality is?\" he said, saying that he would \"take on me the Superman coat, because then no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try love.\"
His comments were made at least twice, and the employees who worked at SNL looked embarrassed reported Variety, where a staff member said: \"The entire studio was put to death.\"
West was brought in as the last little substitute for singer Ariana Grande when her boyfriend Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West confused many when he put on the song \"I Love It\" dressed like a Perrier water bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the Conservative Group of TPUSA, Candice Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of our bravest: TAKING TO SINGING THE ANNUAL MASSEN.”
But Talkshowvert Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just “who he is and it's absolutely amazing”.
“But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music, his clothing, or his support of “art”) which I mean cultivate and cast out ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
We are, too, added.
Before the show the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name. He said that from now on he was \"being formally known as Kanye West\".
He is not the first artist to change his name and now follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Colleagues Snoop Dogg has had the name Snoop Lion. Then, of course, the late musical doctor Prince, who changed the name of a symbol and then the artist who was once known as Prince.
Aimed for attempted murder after stabping at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45 - year - old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant east in Belfast on Friday.

The aim will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones-star Kit Harington dealer out against \"Gypsical Masculinity\"
Kit Harington is known as Jon Snow, the sword-wanderer in HBO's violent fantasy series, added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31 - year - old actor has gone out and criticized the stereotyping of the macho hero and says such movie roles often make young men think they have to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture Kit said something has gone wrong and wondered how to attack the problem of “toxic masculinity” in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones fellow Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted he was very interested in the theme.
“It worries me a lot at the moment — where did the masculinity go wrong?”, he said.
“How have we raised men in view of the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that TV may be partly responsible for the increase in “toxic masculinity ” because of the strong masculine roles.
He said, \"What is born of you, and what is born of you?
What is being broadcast on TV and on the street, making young boys feel that they have to cultivate this very side of being a man?
I think it is one of the really big questions today — how can we change that?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.\"
In the interview, he also admits that he will not make any progresser or successor of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and says he is “completed with battlefields and horses”.
From November, Kit will play the leading role in a new recording of Sam Shepard True West. This is the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife during the recordings, so something good came out of it — my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygrite, which Kit's role figure Jon Snow is in love with, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family's property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of as much as 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, says a health representative.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are transmitted through sex, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China by infection through blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV this way is now closer to zero, said Chinese health care professionals at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Year by year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminated in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men marry women.
Much of the disease is caused by inadequate sex protection in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese authorities have promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of an action to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to co-operate leaked data on Republican senators, fizzles of “hazardous lies” and “conspiracy theories”.
Member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, rejected Saturday charges that members of her staff had posted the personal information to three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the Lawmaker.
The democrat of Los Angeles assured by the claims were made by “ultraconservative” commentators and web pages.
\"Saturists, liars, and more reprehensible lies\" said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published information included allegedly the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate about the assault charges against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative web pages, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the article was traced to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of Waters' staff, according to Hill.
“This unfounded charge is totally false and a regular lie,” continued Waters.
“The members of my staff - who have received their identities, personal information and security compromised as a result of these false and false accusations - had absolutely no responsibility for the leak of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a regular lie.”
Waters' statement was quickly criticised online, among other things by former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is aggressive,” wrote Fleischer.
“This indicates that she does not have the right temper to be a member of Congress.
When accused of something they have not done, they must not be aggressive.
They can't go into defense.
Do not question the motives of the prosecutor.
They must act calmly.'
Fleischer compared Waters' response to the democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too aggressive during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who works to remove Waters in the middle whales, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
\"Large - if it is true\", he tweeted.
In her statement Waters said that her office had notified ‘relevant authorities and police about these false accusations’.
“We will see to it that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued “and that they are held responsible for all acts that are destructive and dangerous to each of my staff.”
Review by Johnny English Strikes Against - bloodless Rowan Atkinson in spy parody
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit references in all new films with a British look and it seems to be relevant to this revitalization of the parodifranchise Johnny English action comedy - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was restored in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic self-satisfy how clearly hopeless we are to become the nation's new export product?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his bulging eyes and the rubber face have had his license renewed to mess it up for the second time — his name says more than anything that he is a clear and comic figure designed for territories with non-English-speaking cinema audience.
Of course, he's the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a pussy Mr Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes a single note to the music feature of the fire car theme during the opening ceremony at the Olympic Olympics in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the role played by Atkinson in the long-lost TV ads for Barclaycard; the traveling and international mysteryr who leaves chaos everywhere.
There's a beautiful moment in the most recent Johnny English journey.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades narrowed his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy comes to its right, but the humor feels quite bloodless and strangely redundant, especially now that the “serious” brand items like 007 and Mission Impossible have willingly gone away by comedy.
The sense of humor seems to be more focused on children than on adults, and to me Johnny English's fades are not as inventive and pointed as the silent movie lobes in Mr Bean.
The current precedent is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies and exposed the identity of all British agents in the field to the fear of the guarding agent - a regrettable little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop for a prime minister, a pumpy and depressed figure who's already going through a complete crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing a very good job with this like Teresa-May role, but the script doesn't give her much to work on.
Her intelligence advisers inform us that since every active spy has been exposed, she has to collect some of the retired.
And that means the clover Johnny English, who now works as a teacher on a snobish establishment, but gives unofficial instruction in secret intelligence, and there are some polite sequences here when English offers a rocka academy for spying.
English is taken back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with his old, plagued helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, excited with a submarine commander, a hysterical upper class lady, where Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So the Batman and Robin style of messing up everything else on mission for the Queen is back, where they confront with Olga Kurylenko amazing five fatal, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the prime minister is seduced by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's cyber problems: the sneaky Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their journey with a far-fetched side leap: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a boasting French restaurant, creating chaos as they hide on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English triggers pure pineapple as he tries to use a VR headerset to make himself known in Volta's house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but still so lovely and noisy there's a lot of memories of child TV with the whole thing.
Quite mediocre, all of it.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think, can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets to use his talent?
Labour refuses to make plans to let the British work four days a week, but get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is going to assess a radical plan that will give the British four-day workweek - but get paid for five.
The party apparently wants managers to use savings on the revolution with artificial intelligence by giving employees an extra day off.
This will mean that employees will receive a three-day weekend while receiving the same wages.
Sources say that the idea fits into the party’s economic agenda and plans to move the country in favor of workers.
The trade unions support the transition to four days ’ week so that employees too can enjoy the benefits of the new economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It will not happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition that fits the party’s desire to allow the pendulum to swing to the advantage of the workers — in addition to the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea.
However, the idea is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day week is not the party’s policy and is not an assessment by the party.”
The Labour Finance spokesman, John McDonnell, used the Labour Conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to withdraw the power of \"unsightly directors\" and \"professors\" from public service providers.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that current shareholders in water companies are in danger of not getting the entire stock item back because a Labour Government can make “deduction” based on perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in corporate boards and to set up employee funds in order to transfer 10 % of equity to private companies to employees who may benefit from an annual dividend of GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell the 60 Minutes about the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh can change their minds.
The FBI review of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has suspended a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question whether the Agency's findings may change the mind of any Republican senators.
In a Sunday interview, correspondent Scott Pelley asked in 60 Minutes — Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than South Carolina's colleague.
\"I mean, of course,\" said Kennedy.
“I said at the opening of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Judge Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and said, \"Did you do it?\"
He was determined, bold, unequivocal.
Graham’s voice, however, seems to be stoned.
\"I have made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and in that case it had to be a startling finding,\" he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it vigorously, added Graham and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people she mentioned could confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything new will change that.\"
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it helped to fight poverty?
This Saturday is New York’s host for the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive list of stars to perform and an equally impressive mission; eradicating the world’s poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh year, will bring thousands of people to the large lawn in Central Park, not only to experience sizes such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to fight poverty by getting more people to work actively against poverty.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks, or ‘actions’ such as volunteer work, send e-mail to a world leader, take a phone or in other meaningful ways to raise awareness of their poverty eradication objectives.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when it is only 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free-constructed, genuine way of getting people to fight for change, or just another case of so-called “clicktivism” - that people feel they are contributing greatly by signing a signature campaign online or sending a tweet?
Global Citizens say that since 2011, they have registered more than 19 million “actions” from their followers, with a wealth of different goals.
They say that these actions have contributed to making world leaders declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group could refer to 390 exposures and announcements as a result of their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funding so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main concerns are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and greeners based in Britain who are \"helping children to exploit their full potential\", and promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice with malnutrition a footnote in history,” told Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in Britain for better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional measures.
In answer to one of the usual questions on the web page \"What makes you think that we can eradicate extreme poverty?\"
The global citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road — sometimes we will fall and fall.
But like the important civil rights and the anti-apartred movements before us, we will succeed because we stand stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists performing this year's event in New York, which will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use the Navy as a block to prevent Russian energy exports - Minister of the Interior
Washington can “if necessary” resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, according to Washington Examiner, the U.S. Minister of the Interior, Ryan Zinke.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially when operating at the invitation of the legal government — is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that they are in the Middle East because they want to negotiate energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flank of Europe,” he says.
And according to the spokesperson, there are always ways and means to handle this.
“The US has the opportunity, through the Navy, to ensure that the maritime roads are open and, if necessary, to block to ensure that the energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at the event held by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that profiles itself as “the voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington's ways of dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they were far on track.
‘The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel’, he said and referred to Russia as one trick pony with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The statements came after the Trump administration has been on a tour to strengthen exports of its liquid natural gas to Europe; they want to replace Russia, the most cheap option for European consumers.
Therefore, employees of the Trump Administration, including the President himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the ‘inadaptive’ project The North European gas pipeline 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the ‘captive’ of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North European gas pipeline worth $11 billion, which is to double the existing gas pipeline capacity to a capacity of 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is motivated only by economic causes and is an example of undue competition.
“I think we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and consumers’ ability to choose a supplier,” said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The attitude of the United States has faced opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its responsibilities in the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to stay out of EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have serious problems with third countries that interfere with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of the BDI after a recent meeting between the German chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will 'think seriously' on her presidential candidate for 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would 'think seriously' if she wanted to run for president after the mid-term elections.
During an election meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she wanted to make a stand.
“It’s time for women to get to Washington and fix the shaking government, and that includes a woman on top,” said The Hill.
'After 6 November, I would like to think seriously about whether or not to make a presidential candidate.'
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the election meeting and said that he 'led the country in the wrong direction'.
“I’m worried about the margin of what Donald Trump is doing with democracy,” she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday's tweet, Warren said, \"Of course we need an FBI audit before voting.\"
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren's own voters do not think she should stand still in 2020.
58% of 'probable' voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be silent, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidate.
The survey showed higher support for former Governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidacy and 48% were against it.
Other highly-profiled democratic names discussed in connection with a possible candidacy in 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make up his mind officially by January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin points out Track Palins PTSD during Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after serving in September.
He was arrested and charged with a home violence on Monday night
\"What my son is going through, what he goes through after coming home, I have in common with other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability our soldiers carry,\" she told the audience at an election event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest \"the elephant of space\" and said of his son and other veterans: \"They come home a little different, they come home the shepherd, they come home and they wonder if this is the respect for what their soldiers' companions, their pilots and all the other members of the military have contributed to the country.\"
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence on a woman, clustering with a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a police spokesman in Wasilla.
18 Länder and D.C. support testing of new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal test of a new policy in the United States which refuses asylum for victims who flee gang or home violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. provided a briefing from amicus curiae (friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, reported NBC News.
The whole name of the defendant in Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Freedoms Union launched in August against the federal police has not been published.
She claimed that her partner “and his violent gang members’ sons” abused her, but government officials in the United States rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers for the United States, as nations that have extensive gang and home violence problems.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a 2014 decision by the Court of Appeal of immigrants who granted undocumented immigrants who fled from home violence the right to apply for asylum.
Advocate General Karl Racine of the District of Columbia said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “is ignoring many decades of state, federal and international law”.
«Federal law requires all asylum requirements to be determined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a ban is contrary to that principle\", said the Amicus Curiae.
The lawyers further argued in the orientation that policies which refused immigrants access harm the American economy and say that they are highly likely to become greeners and “help with the necessary labour” —
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to give asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
‘Asyl is available to those who leave the home country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social or political group’ said Sessions in the announcement of 11 June on politics.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all problems — even serious problems — that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operation in Palu — death figures double in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation got worse.
\"It was very tense,\" says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while comforting her feverish son at an evacuation center in the congregated town of Palu.
“All the time you see ambulances picking up the dead.
Pure water is defective’.
People who came to a ruined home and made their way through damaged water in an effort to save what they could find could be seen.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 - strength earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, are sitting outside Palus military hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors because of ongoing severe aftershocks.
He finds tears in his eyes when he recounts the feeling of the violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was squeezed by the wall that collapsed, I think,\" said Haris to Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife shout for help, and then it kept quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.\"
The US ambassador accuses China of harassment with 'propaganda adverts'
One week after a public Chinese newspaper ran a four - page ad in an American newspaper that discerned the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador of China Beijing accused of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the Annex China Daily paid to move into Des Moine’s Register — the most important newspaper in Iowa — after accusing China of trying to interfere with US Congressional elections on November 6, an accusation China rejects.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to influence the elections in the United States marked a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China, said U.S. officials, according to Reuters.
While it is normal for foreign authorities to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has resulted in rounds of new customs duties on one another’s imported goods.
China's punishment toll early in the trade war would hit export holdings in states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party, reports Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long - term governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
In a reader’s post on Sunday Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote: “Kina is now stepping up the harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press. ”
“By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities are taking advantage of the freedom of expression and the open press that we enjoy in America to put a paid ad in Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
“As a contrast — by the newspaper on the street here in Beijing, you will not find many differing opinions and will not experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese people around China’s problematic economic course, given that the media is under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added: “One of China’s largest newspapers refused to publish” his article, although he did not disclose what newspaper it was.
Republicans scare away female voters before the middle-elected Kavanaugh fades, warning analysts
Since many top politicians among the Republicans support and defend candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual abuse, analysts warn that they will have a counter - reaction, especially from women, in the coming local elections.
The feelings around this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already given signs that they want to move on with their vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s suggestion of a recent FBI review will be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget yesterday’s events — they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman of the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors sang “November is coming” while protesting in the Senate when the Republicans who controlled the Committee of Justice chose to proceed with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will explode,” said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, to the news site.
“People say it has already been high, that is true.
But it could be higher, especially among female insecure voters in the suburbs and younger electors between 18 and 29 years of age, who often do not vote even though they dislike the president».
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which gave a detailed description of the charges of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts felt that there would be a counter-reaction if the Republicans were forced by the appointment.
“This has become a happy root of the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the RNC (Republic National Committee), early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or final approval or whether Kavanaugh is being installed — it’s also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have dealt with her,” pointed out Guy Cecil, director of Priorities, a group that promotes the choice of democratic candidates, to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided over who to believe in in the wake of Ford’s and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a small majority in favor of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents were completely or quite convinced of Ford's testimony, while 35% said they were completely or quite convinced of Kavanaugh's production.
In addition, 38% said they were quite or completely convinced that Kavanaugh lied under his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After the Flake play, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford in addition to at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford explained to the Senate Justice Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh, in his drunk state, molested her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed her genitals while they were at a party during the study time in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web's Author plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, World Wide Web's author, launchs a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest Technology Doctor's project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lees' open source platform Solid.
At Solid, users can choose where to store their data and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked about the purpose of \"world domination\".
\"We have to do it now,\" he said on the start.
\"It is a historic moment.\"
The app uses Solid technology to let people create their own “personal data storage online” or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all are available on one browser simultaneously.
What's unique about the online personal data storage is that it's all the way up to the user who's going to have access to that kind of information.
The company calls it ‘personal authorization through data’.
The idea behind Inrupt is according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, that the company should provide resources, process and relevant competence to make Solid available to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers on contract to work with the project and a bunch of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to 'Facebook and Google that they're going to introduce something brand new or not, which will make their business models completely re-calted overnight.

Bernard Vann: Celebrating Victoria Cross Recipient from World War I
The only minister of the Church of England to be awarded a Victoria cross during World War I was celebrated in his hometown after a hundred years.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Vann were awarded the honour on September 29, 1918, at the battle in Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was never told that he was assigned the highest British military distinction.
A memorial was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said there was a “fine symbolism” in the fact that the stone was to be unveiled exactly 100 years after the grandfather’s award-winning achievement.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September — ‘through very thick fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns’.
Later he headed towards the line of fire and led the line “with great courage” forward before he stormed a field cannon himself and knocked out three of the departments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — just a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said the grandfather's actions were \"something I knew I could never live up to, but something that makes me humble.\"
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid down a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Corps Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said he “felt very honored to play a role in the parade”, adding: “The courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support of many people.”
MMA followers were up all night watching the Bellator 206 martial arts program instead got the Peppa pig.
Imagine that you have stayed awake all night to see the packed Bellator 206, just to find out that you are not seeing the main game.
The San Jose participant made it through 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown directly through the night in Britain at Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, British viewers were seated as the picture suddenly showed Peppa pig.
Some were less impressed after keeping awake until early morning to watch the battle.
A follower described on Twitter the transition to the child program as “a kind of sick joke.”
“It’s government regulation that it’s not appropriate to send such programs at 6:00 a.m. so they had to turn to child programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
\"Puppy pig, yes.\"
Bellator's CEO, Scott Coker, said they're going to work on the transmission plan to include viewers in Great Britain in the future.
\"I think we can figure it out with a view to the rematch,\" said Coker.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday there, and we won’t be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe with-- when we turned over, there were many messages going back and forth, and they weren't exactly of the friendly kind.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't, it was a government thing.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will reduce from six to five battles — usually sent by us — and we tried to reach for the followers, but tipped over.
It's an unfortunate situation.\"
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to sexuality
The Olympic stupor Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority toward everyone because of his sexuality — but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn't until he realized in high school that he wasn't like others.
In his first program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for the rights of gays to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The usual programme manager, Kirsty Young, should be gone for a few months because of illness.
Daley, as a little lost on the first shipment of Laverne, said he felt “less worth” than everyone else he grew up with because “it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls”.
He said: \"To this day it is these feelings of being inferior and different that have been the real motivation and have me the power and strength to succeed.\"
He wanted to prove that he “was something,” he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He's a two-time bronze winner in the Olympics and has become a high-profile LGBT ambassador, using his participation at this year's Conspirator in Australia to appeal for more countries to decrime homosexuality.
He said he stands out because he feels lucky that he can live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others hope.
The three times world champion said that he fell in love with a man - filmmaker Dustin Lance Black from the United States, which he met in 2013 - “surpassed me”.
Daley married Oscar's winner, 20 years older than him last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age” - he participated in his first Olympic when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later — he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Dayy, and Daley said his whole perspective had been changed.
\"If you had asked me last year, it was all about me having to win only one gold medal,\" he said.
“You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals in the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked was if they had obtained tickets to London in 2012 — since he wanted to sit in the first row.
\"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't live long enough to sit in the front row,\" he said.
“I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the Olympics in 2012 and won bronze.
“I only knew that this was what I had dreamed all my life — to dive in front of a home audience under the Olympics, the best feeling ever,” he said.
It also inspired his first song - Proud of Heather Small — which meant a lot to him in the drive-up before the Olympics and still gives him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs goes to BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Formvake Mickelson taken out to the golf tournament Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday when he plays his 47 Ryder Cup game, but he has to get in shape if there isn't to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the Biennial for an impressive 12th time, was put on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk before Saturday's foursome and foursome games.
Instead of being in the center of events, which he had so often been to the United States, the five times major winner divides the day between being a cheerleader and working on his game at the rank, hoping to fix it.
The 48-year-old never had the best swing, even on the top of his career, and is not in perfect shape of the tight Le Golf National course, where the long rough area still punishes lost blows.
And if the track itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson, in the ninth fight on Sunday, himself the British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined the beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 single games, get a successful start, Mickelson’s game can turn out to be absolutely decisive.
Furk expresses confidence in his husband, not that he could say otherwise.
“He fully understood his role today, gave me a pat on his back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready the next day,” said Furyk.
\"He has great confidence.
He is a Hall of Famer and has brought so much to these layers before, and this week.
I guess I didn't see him playing two games.
I pictured more, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most played Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely reached his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draw, but Furyk said his involvement brought some intangible values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, and likes to make fun of others; he’s a great guy to have in the courtroom,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun trying against him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives much more than just the game.\"
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a significant lead at the entrance to the last day single game in Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 battle at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but boasted the victory with the least margin possible, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only in so far,” said Bjørn, photographed after watching Class of 2018 winning 5-3 on Friday and yesterday leading 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone else on the team that this isn't over.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus is.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are very aware of what is on the other side — the best golfers in the world’.
Bear is very pleased with how his players have managed on the tough golf course and adds: “I couldn’t do better.
Tomorrow's a new challenge.
Tomorrow it is the individual performances that are at the center, and that is quite another thing.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there alone, your achievements like golfers are being tested to the full.
It is the message you must convey to the players that they must get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave the partner, and he must also go out and get the best out of himself.\"
Unlike Bjørn, opponent Jim Furyk will try to make his players do better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the major revolutions the last day. He joined the Brookline winning team before he ended up losing when Europe performed the Medinah miracle.
I remember every damn word of it,” he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had harassed his players at the entrance to the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to get a good start, like the one we experienced at Brookline, as we saw at Medinah.
When the moment begins to go in one direction, it puts great pressure on the middle of the battles.
You know, we're trying to create something magic tomorrow.
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the fight and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the top half of the player sequence.
\"I'm betting on this group of men in that order because I think it's all the way,\" said Bjørn about his choices of single players.
Germany’s new warship delayed again
German Marine's latest frigate should have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the days of the Cold War, but it won't be until next year's due to failing systems and galloping costs, reported local media.
The completion of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the ship of the brand new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, quoted by a military spokesperson.
The ship was supposed to have been handed over to the Navy in 2014, but the major problems after delivery were pursuing the ambitious project.
The four ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg Marine class ordered completely back in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It is agreed that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods — it would be possible to use the latest frigates for up to two years away from the home port.
Still delays mean, however, that advanced warships — said to give Germany strength at sea — will already be out - of - date before they are served, reports Die Zeit.
The fateful F125 fregoat created headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to operate the vessel and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the return, but the German media mentioned a number of important “software and hardware defects” that made the warship useless in a battle mission.
The software defects were particularly important since ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew on older frigates in the Bremen class.
It was also discovered that the ship has a huge overweight, which reduces performance and limits the marines ’ potential for future upgrades.
The 7000-tonne heavy-Rheinland-Palatinate is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price tag on the entire project — including training the crew — has become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached a leveling EUR 3.1 billion — from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of the new frigates are particularly significant in the light of fresh warnings that Germany’s marine force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Government’s Defence Committee, confirmed that the Navy is actually ‘out of usable ships’.
The official said that the problem has escalated over time because old ships were outrun, but no new vessels were found.
He regrets that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the Navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of the Bats
New research carried out by a rural area in the Highlands of Scotland will reveal how bats use the landscape in the pursuit of food.
There is hope that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and contribute to the design of future conservation measures.
The study for researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and dwarf bats as well as tanning and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analyses of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bats and the species that do what.
A habitat map and a report will then be prepared to produce a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, the conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will be included in the decision on the measures to be taken, such as the laying of pastures and the best way to protect the forest for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction that affects breeding sites and the reduction of habitats.
Windmills and lighting may also pose a risk, the same as flypapers and certain chemically treated building materials, as well as the attack by house taxes.
In fact, bats are not blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, they need ears more than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation to find insects and obstacles on the road when they fly.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten skilled experts who regularly carry out research, surveying breeding sites, and sometimes rescue work.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only own bat reserve at the Three-country property in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property Manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
\"Here on Three we have a perfect area for bats,\" he says.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and other property will help us understand more about what they need to thrive».
He emphasizes the importance of mapping the bats before maintenance is carried out on a property since the accidental destruction of a single breeding site can kill up to 400 females and young people, and perhaps destroy an entire local population.
Bats are protected, and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, or disturb them, or destroy their breeding grounds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish member of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the audience to help in the work.
She says: \"We still have much to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we simply don't know how the populations are doing.\"
Ronaldo rejects the rape charges while lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape charges against him as “false news” and says that people “want fame” by using his name.
His lawyers will sue German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He's accused of paying her $375 000 in return for keeping close to the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
When he spoke on a direct video of Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after the charges were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo rejected the charges as ‘false news’.
\"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news,\" says five times the Gold Ball wins into the camera.
“They want fame by using my name.
It's common.
They want fame by giving my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm fine,\" the football player adds a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel because of the allegations, which they have called “an unacceptable representation of suspicions in the private sphere”, according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the football player will require compensation for “condemnity damage to an extent equal to the severity of the breach, which is likely to be one of the most serious breaches of privacy in recent years.”
The alleged event should have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga must have returned to the football player’s room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged event and told her that he was “99 % a good man” who was failed by the “one percent”.
The records show that Ronaldo confirmed the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were taken pictures in the hospital, but later they settled outside the court because she was “encouraged of revenge” and was also concerned about “be held public”.
The 34-year-old says she's now trying to put the settlement aside because she's still traumatized after the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged abuse, and this summer moved to Italian Juventus on a contract worth EUR 100 million.
Brexit: Britain “will mourn forever” to lose car manufacturers
Britain “will mourn forever” if they lose their status as world leader in car production after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “worshipful” that Topotecan UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, they would stop production temporarily at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
\"We need a deal,\" said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the consequences of delayed border crossing at any Brexit without an agreement could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the EU.
“If Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will, in my view, see that production at our factory stops,” said Marvin Cooke, President-in-Office of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other British producers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement as to how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says they'll close the Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is whether what car manufacturers say is supply chain risks at any Brexit without any agreement.
Toyata's production line is operated on the basis of «order as required», and it arrives every 37 minutes from suppliers both in Britain and in the EU for cars made on demand.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, the border may remain, as the industry says can lead to delays and a lack of parts.
There will be no way of keeping a store of more than a day's stock at the Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production will stop.
Clark said that Theresa Mays Brexit Plan for Further Relations with the EU is “presist set up to avoid such checks at the border”.
\"We must have an agreement, and we want to get the best deal that will enable us, as I say, not only to enjoy success at the moment, but to seize this opportunity\", he said on the BBC Radio 4's Today program.
‘The business, not only from the Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains’.
Toyota could not say how long production will be stopped, but warned that long - term costs will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually lead to loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the trade union leader at the factory, said that members are becoming increasingly concerned: \"My experience suggests that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back.\"
A government spokesperson said: 'We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU'
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's fateful meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein may be “one more week” while the battle around the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, reported the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is in charge of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian involvement in the elections, relations between Trump and Russia, and possible obstruction of the President's trial.
The question of Trump will dismiss the Deputy Minister of Justice or not, and thus threaten the independence of Mueller, has been nagging during the speculations in Washington for many months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of taking up talks with Trump and trying to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Constitutional Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that he was resigning voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he would “preferably not” to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was subjected to the fact that it crashed with Senate’s justice committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both of them.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which further exposed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, participated at Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: \"A date for the meeting was not set; it could be this week, but I realized it could be a week's postponement because of everything that happens to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'm always busy keeping the press up to date.\"
Some journalists will question that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10th.
Programvert Chris Wallace asked the reason.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to disapproval of the \"self-sufficiency\" of TV reporters, although she added: \"I do not disagree with the fact that they are self-serving.\"
Then she suggested that the contact between Trump and the press will become more frequent.
“The President raises questions more than any previous president,” she said, adding without presenting evidence: “We have looked at the figures.”
There will still be press conferences, said Sanders, but “if the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it’ll definitely be better than talking to me.
We're trying to make it happen a lot, and you've seen that we've been doing it a lot over the last few weeks, and it's going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump often answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open events or press conferences when visiting important people.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the potential cause when he was running a solo race and at times had strange behavior in front of a lot of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland regarding Brexit concerns
The Health Secretary has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and a desire to remain behind Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish MEP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain was to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of applying for residence and work permits for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: \"Studies between Britain and the EU about the announcements have taken place throughout the summer and are expected to land on a solution for the fall.
However, the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible unannounced scenario.
I understand this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
I will therefore repeat now how highly I appreciate the efforts of each member, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and outside, provide valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the health care work for the benefit of patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we hope you will stay here.\"
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing urgent surgery after head injury
Defense player at Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, underwent urgent surgery after having suffered a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ reported in the Tennessee newspaper.
Tennessee States' main coach, Rod Reed, told journalists that the damage occurred just before the first round was over.
'He came out on the sidelines and just collapsed there' said Reed.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they placed him on a stretcher and took him behind for further examination.
An executive from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘not yet available information on the type/length of the injury’ and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after the transition from Illinois.
He had five roofs Saturday before he finished the game, which gives a total of 18 roofings for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when purchasing property in Britain, according to new Tory plans, the extra money will be used to help the homeless
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's plan to attract young voters
The increase in the document will be collected from those who do not pay taxes in Britain
Finance experts expect to increase to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May today will announce that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in Britain — and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The action will be considered an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to attract young people to choose with the promise to offer more affordable housing and to hit high income groups.
The billing will be imposed on persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in Britain, and the extra money will strengthen government action to remedy the situation of the homeless.
The surplus, which comes in addition to the current document fee, including the higher tariff introduced two years ago on housing number two and dwelling purchase for rent, can be as much as 3%.
The Department of Finance expects that the measure will bring up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which pushes prices up and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to get foot in the housing market.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital city, have become “sport cities ” because of the many foreign buyers who spend most of their lives outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson suggested a reduction in the document fee to help more young people own their own home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping housing prices high by buying out land without using it and demanded that Theresa May reject quotas on reasonable housing to resolve Britain’s ‘shamble housing policy’.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a startling series of proposed housing reforms, including rental checks and an end to unfounded drafts.
He also wants to give the Communist regimes greater power to build new homes.
May said: \"I said last year that I would take my time as prime minister to restore the British dream — that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our broken-down housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a life here.
However, it cannot be as easy for people who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign - based companies, to buy homes that are too hard - working British citizens.
For very many people, the dream of owning their homes has become too distant, and the unworthy situation of the homeless endures.\"
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland'
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross, says his \"final goal\" is to become Scotland's manager sooner or later.
The 42 - year - old Scots rejoice at the challenge of revitalizing the northeastern club, which currently holds third place in the League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiery last season.
“ I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
I got a B-caps and it was,\" said Ross to BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
“But I was often with my father and saw Scotland at Hampden as a child, and there’s always something withdrawing me.
However, that opportunity would only come if I succeed in the club management.\"
Ross' predecessors like Subland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic chief says he wasn't anxious to follow such established names in the big club, and has previously refused approximations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
'For me, success at the moment will be measured on whether I can get the club back in the Premier League'.
Based on the structure and the facilities of this club, they no doubt belong to the Premier League,\" he said.
It is not an easy task to get it there, but I will probably only consider myself successful here if I get the club back there»
Ross has only been in management for three years, after a period of assistant head of Dumbarton and a 15-month card performance at Hearts' training team.
Then he helped Alloa to recover from the drop to the third division and helped St Mirren from the edge of the downpour to win the championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during the gambling career of Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was likely a proper separation,” he recalls when taking over the leadership of Alloa.
“I really thought that leadership was right for me more than playing.
It sounds strange because I did well, made me a reasonable income from it, and experienced some fine highlights.
But football can be tough.
There are a lot of things you have to get through on a weekly basis.
I'm going through it with stress and pressure at work, but management feels just right for me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do, and it feels like the most comfortable thing I've known all my adult life.

The heat wave of the summer has strengthened the income of Britain’s hard - pressed pubs, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars had a turnover increase of 2,7 % in July, while the income for restaurants fell 4,8 %, the figures show.
Peter Martin, a business consultant CGA, who summarized the figures, said: “Continued sunshine and England’s unexpected long participation in the World Cup, July followed a similar pattern as in the previous month of June, when the pubs went up 2.8%, except that restaurants were even harder hit.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurant turnover in June only worsened in July.
Drinking-based pubs and bars had the very best results, but an increase that was stronger equal to and equal than the restaurants went down.
Food - serving pubs also struggled with the sun, even though it was not as dramatic as it was for the rapaurants.
It seemed people just wanted to drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, turnover increased by 6,6 % that month, with food serving decreased by 3 %».
Paul Newman, an analyst from RSM, said: \"These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and large sports and social events are still the main factors in market entry.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups are still having a hard time, and a drop of 4.8% year-on-year sales will be particularly painful at the top of running cost pressures.
The long, warm summer could not have arrived at a worse time for food serving facilities, and time will show if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will give a longed-out breathing room».
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the rollout of new trademarks.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, a business operator for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the United Kingdom, collects and analyses the results of 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of £9 billion, and is the established industry standard.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children — some just 11 years old — has secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers show
A study of 20,000 high school students exposed pages with «fake Insta».
The news has raised concerns about sexual content.
20% of the students said they have a head account that they show their parents.
One in five children — some just 11 years old — opens social media accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in Fake Insta accounts — a reference to image sharing pages on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the sharing of sexual content.
20% of the students said they had an innocent head account, which they refer to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret page to her 13 - year - old daughter found a teenager who urged others to “rapid me”.
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Vice-Chancellors' Conference (HMC) for private schools, revealed that 40% of 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half admitted to keeping secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: \"It is scary that so many youths are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers cannot find them\".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the “freedom practitioners” in the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected the board of Scottish Athletics and has a non-executive role in the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated trackman, and President Ian Beattie described the incident as a good opportunity for those leading the sport to gain insight into her extensive international experience over the last ten years.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world-wide free sport community, and we are sure that those in Scotland will enjoy getting her into the board,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: \"I am eager to act as a voice for the free-time athletes, and I hope I have much to contribute in order to guide sports in Scotland.\"
The American won 200 and 400 metres under the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996 and has a total of four Olympic gold, and now she's a solid BBC expert, and after she had a transient ischaemic attack she couldn't walk.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago today I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I want to be recovered and to what extent.
It’s been hard work, but I’m fine again and have learned to walk again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for all the words of encouragement.\"
Breast pump ad that compares mothers to cows divides opinion online
A breast - pump company has divided online opinion into an ad that compares breast - feeding mothers to milked cows.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump that is carried close to the body,” published Elvie, the technology-based company for consumer goods, a fresh and flirting, music video-inspired ad to demonstrate freedom the new pump gives active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows to a song with the following words: \"Yes, I am milking myself, but you can't see any tail\" and \"In case you didn't realize it, this is not law, these are my tits.\"
The cow continues: “Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my balls.”
However, the advertisement published on the company’s Facebook page has created a storm on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, many say the beauty of the “bad luck” in the dairy business.
“Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and fed to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth,” one wrote.
Elvie breast pump gets nice place in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Improbably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But ‘ hey, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?’
Another added: 'For a failed ad.'
Others defend the ad. A woman admitted that she thought the song was “unbelievably funny.”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd love to have one if I was still breast-feeding.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product,' one who wrote.
Another commented: “This is a funny ad directed at mothers who pump (often at work or toilets) and feel like ‘coves’.
This is not an ad that salutes or judges the dairy industry».
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they've all danced with the discreet pump in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women pumping say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is quite quiet, has no wires or hoses and gets nice space in a breast-fed bra, so that women get the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD of Mother, commented: «The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and dairy cows, we wanted to put search lights on breast pumping and all the challenges, while in an entertaining and recognizable way we show the incredible sense of freedom of the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a two - child mom appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrants moved to a tent camp at the Texas border secretly
While the monthly cross-border crossing has remained relatively stable, in part because hard rhetoric and politics introduced by the Trump Administration have made it more difficult to place children in support players.
Traditionally, most supporters themselves have been undocumented immigrants and have been afraid of destroying their own chances of staying in the country by coming forward and demanding a child.
The risk was increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other household adults had to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the immigration and customs services, testified to Congress that the Bureau had arrested dozens of persons who were applying for support for single minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 % of the arrested persons did not have a criminal record in the past.
“Almost 80% of the people who are either supporters or members of the household of supporters are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminals.
So we continue to pursue these people,\" says Albence.
The officers are trying to handle the children faster and introduce new rules that indicate that some of them have to appear in court within one month of being arrested, not 60 days as the previous standard, according to reception workers.
Many will be presented by videoconferencing rather than face up personally to bring their case of residence to an immigration court.
Those deemed unjustified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children are in custody, the greater the risk of anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to reception workers and reports that have appeared in the job in recent months.
Lawyers said that these concerns have grown at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where children who labor are easily overlooked because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the camp without enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good - bye to friends can strengthen traumas that many people are already struggling with.
Syria asks U.S., French and Turkish ‘coupling forces’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech in the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces remained illegally on Syrian soil, while covering the fight against terrorism and “will be dealt with accordingly”.
'They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally' he said to the House.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terrorism is now over” in Syria, where more than 36,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have fled.
He said Damascus will continue to “prepare this sacred fight until we have cleared all Syrian territories” for both terrorist groups and “all foreign presence”.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for the training and advice of Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar al-assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - torn country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said that conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused “certain Western countries” of “streaking irrational flight” that would keep the refugees away.
“We have approached the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
They are policing what is really a purely humanitarian situation.\"
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last great defensive position of the rebels at Idlib has created an opportunity to press for political talks.
The Russian/Turkish agreement averted a large scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces against the province where there are three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from Al-Qaida-related Nusra Front, who “will be wiped out”.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to call the first meetings of a new committee composed of state and opposition members to draw up a postwar constitution for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem put in place conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the Committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited to ‘the review of the articles of the present Constitution’ and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win another period
After that logic, Trump would have won re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, national law and scandal will end the presidency before that time.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic conclusion to a presidency ever.”
At the moment, there are no signs of seretism.
Since 2014, the best broadcast time ratings have doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen.
“This is a fire that attracts people because we don’t understand anything,” said Neal Baer, programme manager of the ABC drama Designated Survivor, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a well-known comedyist and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Fear Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club”, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the elections in 2016.
The driver told me he was going to vote on Trump.
She asked.
He said, \"Because he makes me laugh.\"
There's an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course — unlike anything else on TV — the actions that take place in Washington can determine the future of the abortion rights, if immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Release is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you reach out to be an enlightened person when you sit for six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of \"deep diver in background material\" for the book \"Fear\", Paul Manafort's leather jacket with ostrichs worth $15,000 (“a garment mirrored with hubris”, said the Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniels' colorful descriptions of Trumps, eh..., anatomy.
At least I don't want to look at Super Mario the same way anymore.
“Some of the things he does that make it look like a reality show is that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, the daily leader of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the “Pawn Stars”, about Trump’s varying role-class and daily twist on the plot (krangle with NFL, ashamed Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss one episode, or you'll be hanging.
When I met Fleiss this week, there was 27°C and the sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he carried himself in and looked at MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He couldn't break free, not when Brett Kavanaugh is going to meet the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the United States Supreme Court.
“I remember when we put all the crazy programs in the old days and people said this is the end of Western civilization,” said Fleiss.
\"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.\"

Outside money flows into the common middle elections of the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th district is experiencing a flow of money after a conversion of a congressional district that ended with two sitting representatives fighting for the same seat.
This newly-populated suburb of Pittsburgh is with the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a supplementary election last spring.
Lamb opposes another seated representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district of old Pennsylvania, who greatly overlaps with the new 17th district.
The map was drawn up again after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old territories were an unconstitutional manipulation of the constituency in favor of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive race for campaign funding between the largest party finance groups, the DCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republic Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a button victory in a close follow-up elections for Pennsylvania’s 18th district to Congress last March.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a small lead.
U.S. Assessed criminal action against El Salvador for support to China, then drew the threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already acknowledged Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a hearty meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw the leadership team out to the Trump Organization.
Officials in the State Department decided to recall the US diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, the department’s spokesperson, in an opinion earlier this month.
However, the penalty measures were only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development, and financial support.
The proposed sanctions measures, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials exposed a top-level conference focusing on security and economic growth to follow up a similar gathering last year that was considered a step forward in attempting to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid - September, officials of the top administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, stopping all plans for criminal action against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now in a position to address the conference, which is now scheduled in mid-October, to show the importance of the administration adding to the session, said the diplomat.
And the three U.S. emissaries calmly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new tough reports or criminal action from Washington.
A White House spokesperson for Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations on the basis of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next stick in the coffin may be special advisor Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstacle to legal exercise, which is now very solid proof in public documents.
Mueller is allegedly also expanding the investigation into whether Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in our elections.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would be held responsible in that body, in the middle of preparing to meet the voters again and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertain factors, and I do not believe that the fall of Trump is inevitable — nor his counterparts in Europe.
The choice of us all must be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938 German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler if only the West had stood up to him and supported the Czechs at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath that followed.
The course of history revolves around such focal points, and the inexorable March of democracy is accelerated or hampered.
The Americans are facing several of these focal points now.
What will we do if Trump kicks Deputy Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in severe weather ever since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secret eavesdrops to the president and speculated that he was unfit to be president.
Rosenstein says The Times' production is incorrect.
“How will we react if the recent FBI audit of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair — or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible assault charges and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the interim for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we don't pass those tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the experience I got in Prague.
My mother was a Checoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me off to light the Sabbath lights on the table with the swastika.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?\"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic before meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians after the impressive drawbar struggle in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented central player Graham Dorrans from doing his first performance for the season of the game of 2-2 against Villarreal, but he thinks Rangers can use the result as a leapboard to get to bigger things.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game and thought we could do something and got one point.
Maybe we could have sunk in at the end, but a draw was probably a good result.
I think they were better in the first place, and we came out second and we were the best team.
I'm sure on Thursday it'll be a big night in Europe.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last fight, but with the home publication in the back, I am sure we can stand on and get a positive result.
The spring was absolutely tough, between everything that happened to my injuries and the replacements in the club itself, but there's a good feeling now.
The team is good and the boys enjoy themselves; the training is good.
Hopefully we can get on now, put the last season behind us and make it.\"
Women lose night sleep because of fear of pension savings
Although the participants in the study had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked about it with their family.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouse about the costs of prolonged care.
Just 10% said they talked to the kids about it.
“People want to be taken care of by some in the family, but they do nothing to take that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
That's how you get it going.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of yourself if you do not tell them what you want in advance.
Discuss with the counselor and the family where and how the care is to be given, for such choices can play a major role in determining the costs.
Include your financial adviser: The counselor can also help you find out how to pay for your expenses.
The funding options for long-term care may include a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses or self-assurance with your own assets — if you have enough money.
Work out your legal documents: Clear legal issues immediately.
Put a health certificate in place by appointing a person you trust to have an overview of your medical care, and make sure that if you are prevented from communicating, health professionals will comply with your wishes.
You should also consider giving some authority over your finances.
You choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your bills are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your old parents are in a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write out the details in a chart so you're prepared.
“It is not just the economy that is at stake — who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
‘What medicines do you need?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?

Man shot several times with an air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times when he was on his way home after a night's sleep.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as an \"unmotivated act\".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 persons have been killed in a massive earthquake and tsunami that met the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and death rates are expected to rise.
Communication is out of operation, and rescue workers have not been able to obtain information from Dongala Regent, an area north of Palu near the epicenter of the earthquake with strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about the Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami occurred.
Dongala is a rule that stretches along more than 300 km by coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, an administrative region below province level, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the carrier beams of the central province of Sulawesi economy, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s emergency administration.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
One tsunami also met western Dongala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is on the seismic Pacific Fire and is regularly struck by earthquakes.
Here are some of the greatest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A massive earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province north of Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226 000 people along the Indian coast, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of strength of 6.8 hit south of Java, Indonesia’s most populated island, and triggered a tsunami that struck the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of strength 7.6 occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of strength of 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands, outside of Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the rule of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic while the people were reminded of the horrors of the mortal earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by adjacent buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes strike Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok and kill more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily stranded thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin’s oldest son arrested for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice-president Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29 years old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, hossing with a report on domestic violence and the counter arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaskan state police.
According to the police report, he should have taken the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged abuse.
Palin is held in Mat-Su custody prison and is arrested for an unsecured 500-dollar debt bill, reported KTUU.
He was presented to court on Saturday, where he declared himself “not guilty, absolutely,” when asked how he asked about the guilt issue, the network reported.
Palin is confronted with three crimes of class A, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and put in a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with an offense of Class B, which can be punished by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time the charge has been made against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the alleged assault.
The case will be brought to Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, hossing with the report of domestic violence and holding a weapon while drunk in connection with the incident.
His boyfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Indonesia’s Tsunami Earthquake: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of power 7.5 triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and deaths are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeastern of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
It circulates videos on social media showing the outbreak.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami fell across the beach.
Federal Public Prosecutors seldom seek the death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York City
New York federal prosecutions seek the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the New York City terrorist suspect who killed eight people — a rare punishment that has not been committed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental to engage in an attack on a bike route along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he mites pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “intendedly” and caused serious injury to the body with intent, according to instructions of intent to seek capital punishment in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for possible death penalty under the case-law.
Several weeks after the attack a federal grand jury of 22 point charges, including eight charges of murder in connection with money blackmail, in the face of Saipov, usually used by federal prosecution authorities in cases of organized crime, and a charge for the violence and wrecking of vehicles.
The attack called for “significant planning and intent”, said the prosecutor, who described the way Saipov performed it as “hospital, cruel and corrupt.”
‘Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, property and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’, establishes the notification of intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the last Southern District of New York led a case that could give the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York City, in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to the court documents.
He told the detectives that he was happy for what he had done, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after watching ISIS videos on his cell phone, according to the charge.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, said the police.
He did not declare himself guilty after the charges of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the publicly appointed defenders of Saipov, said they were “apparently disappointed” over the prosecution’s decision.
'We believe that the decision to seek capital punishment instead of accepting a confession and life in prison without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved' said Patton.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be given responsibility for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to \"mobilize the army of the people\" today during a demonstration during the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians would feel the pressure of the Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he be held responsible for the negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the protestors of Birmingham that Britain would have “had been exorcised” now if Farage was the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge for May to reconcile its deeply divided ranks has been emphasized by Pro-Remain Tories who participated in a demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his Brexit plan on track against attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she go on trying to make a deal with Brüssel despite the setback — forcing eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and the 'kaos'.
Bone told the demonstrators in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a member and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brüssel.
\"If he had been responsible, we would have been out by now,\" he said.
Wellingborough MP added: 'I want to stand for Brexit, but we must reject the Brexit plan'.
To explain his opposition to the EU, he said: \"We did not fight in two world wars to be subject.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.\"
Bone rejected claims that the public opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: \"The claim that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely wrong\".
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration and told reporters: “I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Brexit plan is unpopular in the public; opposition will not vote for it; it is unpopular in the party and with our activists, which are actually the ones who traverse the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Discard the Brexit plan and start listening.
In a direct message to May, she added: 'Ministers keep the job when they keep their promises'.
Farage said that politicians would feel the pressure if they thought of betraying the decision of the 2016 referendum.
“This is now about the trust between us — the people — and that politician,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to let them know that they will not get away with it.”
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to let our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud Britain.'
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before having a two - hour political gathering in the center of town.
A small amount of activists fanned with Tories Against Brexit banners after the launch of the group this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis ridiculed the conservatives for the security issues they had with a party app when the conference started.
“These are the people who tell us they may have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a friction-free limit, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland,” he added.
“It is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,\" he added.
Warren is serious about running as a leading candidate.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “consider seriously being a candidate for president” after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democrats from Massachusetts talked about the future during a town hall meeting west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, re-election in November against Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was vice-president of the Trump Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She's been at the heart of the speculations if she's going to stand against Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon in Holyoke, the event was her 36th meeting with voters, who have been using city hall formats since Trump became president.
One participant asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren said it's time for women to get to Washington to fix our defective government, and that includes a woman at the top.
Assault after Sims from LSU was killed at the time of shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported on Saturday that a suspect is arrested for the shooting incident that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at a news conference at 11.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near campus at Southern University early Friday.
“Wayde Sims had a bullet wound in his head and died as a result,” reported Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted he was on the scene carrying a gun, admitted he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without a lift and held in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Chamber.
Sims was a two-meter-high youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 startings last season. His average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton aims at the World Championship after the stable order gives him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valteri Botta qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes's stable order would play a major role in the race.
From pole, Bottas got a good start and swept almost Hamilton off the track while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vetel drove into the depot first and let Hamilton continue to drive in the rear of the main field, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes made a pit stop a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up after some bumping with the wheels that made the Ferrari driver reluctant to let the insides be free after a double pass to defend himself in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the rear row of the field and entered at the end of the first round of his 21st anniversary.
Then he led in large parts of the race as he lay on the wheels to try to reach a quick conclusion and overwhelm the Kimi Raikon at the age of four.
Finally, he stopped by the 44th round depot, but was unable to speed up the remaining eight rounds and the Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me out.
The team has done a great job to get a good two-span,\" said Hamilton.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein during a political event on Saturday for her arrest that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
When the president spoke during an event in West Virginia, he did not refer directly to Ford’s testimony in front of the Senate Justice Committee; instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate shows that people are “bad, ugly and speak untrue.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you experience the mind, when you see people who are angry and bad and awful and talk untrue,” he said.
“When you look at deliveries and leaks, they say: “Oh, I have not done it.
I have not done it.\"
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you leaked?
Do you remember her answer... did you leak the document--\"Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have not leaked.\"
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked... no, we didn't leak, he added, with a copy of the senator's voice.
Feinstein was sent with detailed information about the charges against Kavanaugh of Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein refused to leak from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t leak her story,” said Feinstein to the Committee, reported The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential as she asked.”
But her denial was not taken kindly by the president, who, at Saturday night's party event, commented: \"I'll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen.\"
In his continued defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use their claims for their own purposes.
“ They have decided to take power back with all necessary means.
You see the madness, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive to get power and control,\" said the president, Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer got two targets for Giants versus Dundee.
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants got a two-stop leadership early, shot from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie deposed the home team before Dwyer restored the leadership of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalled for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League tape for the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come behind after they beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast Friday night.
It was the third session of the season between the teams, and the Giants had won the three previous battles.
Dwyer's opening came for the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford posted the game when Beauvilier doubled the leadership four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period Sullivan brought the home team back to play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt added up to Cownie’s equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants were in charge at break when he took his second goal for the evening at the end of the first round.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard even again counterbalanced with a masterful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee leadership for the first time during the fight late in the second round, and he secured the victory with the team's five-half-way out in the final round.
Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next fight on Friday.
Air traffic controllers die to ensure that hundreds of air passengers escape earthquakes
A air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as having died and made sure that a plane that had hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful pursuits continue to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after his colleagues fled for life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily swaddling control tower at the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, on the runway at the time, could safely lift.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from the Balik Papan in Kalimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts were broken when we heard it,” he added.
The authorities fear that the death stakes may reach thousands, and the country’s disaster response agencies report that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
“The numbers are expected to rise further since many bodies are still trapped under the ruins and many have not been able to reach,” said the spokesman for the organ, Sutpo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to 20 feet [6 m] high waves have destroyed Palu, who will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “All the time you see ambulances picking up the dead.
There's a shortage of clean water.
Minimarkets are robbed everywhere».
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross works feverishly to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it may be much worse.\"
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I am asking you all to work day and night to carry out all the duties of evacuation.
Are you ready?\" said CNN.
Indonesia was struck by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Flights crashed in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing after planes crashed in the lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed in a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean, Micronesia, now says that one man is missing, earlier reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a press release, Air Niugini said that they did not have one male passenger per Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the request for more details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven persons had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and the condition of everyone was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Some Witnesses felt that the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very low.
\"That's a very good thing,\" said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to wade through mid - deep water to the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said the stewards were panicking and screaming, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who worked nearby to repair a pier also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to transport people on land before the plane sank some 30 meters [30 m] below the surface of the water.
Data from Aviation Safety Network suggests that 111 people have died in crashes with PNG registered aircraft in the last twenty years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analysts present the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutions closed the procedure on Saturday in a new trial for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Attorney of Justice, Paul Rowlett, witnessed for several hours as expert witnesses in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile printing to puzzle together the movements of 29 - year - old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19 - year - old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he acquired location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to what he had claimed earlier, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at the same place as Chambers' phone during the time he claimed to have been with friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness office on Saturday and claimed he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in the trailer of Sanford that night, Sanford said he \"was walking because my trailer was in Nashville\".
Another disagreement was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile printing suggests that they had only known each other for one week.
Rowlett said that a little after Chambers' death, Telli's calls were deleted, contact details and messages to and from Chambers from her phone.
\"He erased her from his life,\" said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to start its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed, what's the community-bed hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from the source with political messages to address social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make the community bedside hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have experienced a new upsurge in Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York Children’s Passer sues couples for termination after “racist” notification
A New York pediatrician sues a couple for discriminatory termination after receiving a misjudged message from the mother who complained that she was “only one black person”.
The couple refuses to be racist and compare the case with ‘expression’.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was in black when she met up to her first day of work in 2016.
“NEEEEEL ONE A SVART PERSON,” wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After discovering the mistake, a ‘uncomfortable’ Plasco-Flaxman gave notice to Maurice by claiming that their dismissed child - passport, afro-American, had done a bad job and that she had expected someone from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one working day and then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the termination and demands compensation in the order of 350 dollars a day for the six-month, losji-based arrangement she was promised without a contract.
'I wanted to show them that - hey, you just don't,' she said to the New York Post on Friday, adding: 'I know it's discrimination'.
The couple have turned back on the charges that they are racist and say the resignation of Maurice was the only right thing, since they felt they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she had not meant to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist,\" declared the man Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
“But would you have left your children to someone you would have been rude to, even if it were a misunderstanding?
Your newborn baby?
Come on.
The comparison of the case to “expression” says Plasco was because his wife had only two months to term and was in a “very difficult situation”.
“Is it the kind of person you want to punish?
It's not very pretty, added the stock broker.
As the legal case goes on, the popular court has been quick to condemn the social media couple and criticize them for their behavior and attitudes.
The publisher of Paddington feared the readers would not accept a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: \"It is difficult to sit in the place of others when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know what we now know about Paddington's great success.\"
She says the father, who had worked as a cameraman in the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book by a small cloth bear, would have been very pleased that his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book release was “bitter cute” after he passed away last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important member of the family” and adds that her father secretly was very proud of the success he achieved.
“He was a rather quiet man, and he was not a boastful person,” she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child making a success: you’re proud of it even though it’s not really your fault.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little bit like that.
Even though it was his product and his imagination, he would always give credit to Paddington himself.\"
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
By landing the daughter had been rushed to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it looked so bad, that he did not think she would survive,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Then I got the phone from Nad who said she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, \"Tashi, I love you so much, my friend.
I'll be right with you.
I'm coming to you.
The medicine the doctors had given her to make the heart beat, slowly lost its effect, and left the system.
She died a while earlier, and her body organs clumped.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it happened.
I couldn’t scream and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to pull myself together.\"
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers — who did not know about the trials she went through.
\"No one knew,\" she says.
“ I kept looking down and tears ran in a steady stream.
It's hard to explain, but that's where on the plane I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Postcards with grieving women to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones in suicide are working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have placed postcards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers can call for help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 years old when depression struck him and killed him when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parents to experience what I have to relive every day,” she says.
45 - year - old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says that his son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
\"Everybody knew him on the smile.
They said his smile could light up every room.\"
He quit work before he died because he was “in a really dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11 - year - old brother was one of those who found him after he killed himself.
Sharon says, \"I worry all the time that it will be an infectious effect.\"
Sharon made the cards “to tell people there are people out there that they can go to and talk to, even if it’s just a friend.
Don't sit for yourself - you need to talk to someone\".
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost Mark, his partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
\"He didn't tell me he felt depressed or depressed or anything,\" she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed the altered mood.
On Christmas Day, he was in the basement — when the kids opened their presents, they didn’t get eye contact or anything. ”
She says his death was a great trauma to them, but they must fight through it: “It tears up a big hole in the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we all have to endure and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin line while the FBI starts investigating
“I thought that if we could get some of what he asked for — a time and scope-limited examination — maybe we could reach a certain agreement,” said Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the Committee “divided” along fixed party limits.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The disapproval was due to the timing.
The midwives are only five weeks away, November 6, if the Republicans are probably doing bad, it will be much harder for them to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has called senators and lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House of Bush and met her wife Ashley there when she was a personal secretary of Bush.
What happens after the FBI has delivered its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where at the moment there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, so that Vice President Mike Pence can use his double voice and get him in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors falls under Kim
The number of North Korean jumps to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, pronounced a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong Saug, which refers to data from South Korea’s Department of Collection, said there had been 1127 dropouts last year — compared with 2706 in 2011.
Park stated that stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices for human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang hasn't commented on it in public.
The majority of North Korea’s defectors are offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China sees the defectors as illegal migrants and not refugees and returns them with power.
The relationship between the north and the south — which is technically still at war — has improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month the leaders of the two countries of Pyongyang met for talks on the locked negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work largely for a nuclear Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the U.S. sanctions for lack of progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions there is no possibility that we will unilaterally prepare first,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh \"hysterical\" and says he's unfit to sit in the Supreme Court
The minority leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court student Brett Kavanaugh “hysteric” and said he had a temper that made him unfit to sit in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
\"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had acted like that, she would have been called hysterical,\" said Pelosi of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied his sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, sometimes almost shouting and crying when he was talking about the family and the years of high school.
He was also strongly condemning the Democrats in the Committee and called the allegations against him a “gross and coordinated character killing” organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she meant that Kavanaugh's testimony shows that he can't sit in the Supreme Court because it shows that he's prejudiced against democrats.
\"I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats,\" she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to put Kavanaugh in court if he was approved and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I want to say this — if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he’s not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he’s in now,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abort rights), since he is considered to be a conservative judge.
In the question, Kavanaugh avoided asking whether he would oversee certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time to send a hysterical, partial to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud,” said Pelosi.
And women have to deal with it.
It is a righteous anger, months, and years of anger, and she cannot get it out without crying.
“We cry when we are angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
\"I find it not strange, do you?\"
She continues: “I got good help from a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said that she also cries when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started to cry, she said to the person she talked to “you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.\"
And then she just kept going.
And I thought that was fantastic.\"
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs was in a man - dominated office and I began to cry with inexplicable rage and was caught in the collar of an older woman’s neck — a cool boss who I had always been a little afraid of — who took me to a stairwell.
\"Let them never see you cry,\" she said.
“They don’t know that you’re angry.
They'll think you're sad and happy because they managed to take you.\"
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he was running for office.
In 1987, when Hart was exposed to unfaithfulness to his mate on board a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the elections, Schroeder was very frustrated and thought that there was nothing in the way of examining the possibility of standing as Presidential candidate himself.
“It wasn’t a well thought out decision,” she said with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last ones they needed were one more.
Some called it \"The Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.\"
Since it was near the end of the campaign, she lay behind her funding and swore that she wouldn't stand down if she didn't get $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of the supporters who gave her $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
'Do they think I'm getting a discount, or?' she wonders.
When she gave the speech to announce that she did not want to launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed with feelings — gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration of the system that made it so difficult to drive money and to reach voters instead of delegates, and anger about sexism — that she fell into tears.
\"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown,\" Schroeder recalls how the press referred to her.
\"You'd think Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I can't remember thinking what they'd write on my graverest.
'She cried?'
How the Trade War USA-China can benefit Beijing
The openings in the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and even though the struggle is far from over, a rift between countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, says experts.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation occurred this week with new customs duties on goods worth $200 billion, which means toll of half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Of course, Beijing has returned every time, most recently with a $60 billion bill of five to ten percent on American goods.
China has promised to match the United States attacks for attack, and the world's second-largest economy will probably not lift the white flag with the first.
Getting Washington to step down means giving in to demands, but public submission to the United States will be too humiliating for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure around the trade war with the United States can give a long - term positive statement to China by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that start economic cycle effects in one of the countries is far more dangerous than the spectators have realized in the past,” said Abigail Grace, a research colleague focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tankmie.
Syria “ready” for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says they are ready for voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help to restore the country, which has been destroyed after more than 7 years of war.
When he spoke at the UN National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
“Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,” he says.
The state continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All the conditions now lie in place for voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that struck their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war started in 2011.
In addition, there are six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the ruined country.
But he stressed that there would not be acceptance of conditional assistance or aid from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe guarantees Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe has won 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating Team USA with a final result of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times after each other on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the throne when the Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn received the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who tore in large parts of the tournament, beat his tea-beats in the water at par 16.
The Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant on all his rounds and became 1 out of 4 golfers who have ever gone 05-0 since the tournament got their current design in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 and 4 of the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top-ranking player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup finale.
With as many as eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind them, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most winning Europeans of the tournament throughout the ages of 25.5 careers.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful Thomas picked me up and had faith in me.
I'm very, very happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help,\" said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He leaves the stick to his countryman John Ram, who beat the American golfer Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in single games on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods — I followed that man close to growing up,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four fights in France and now has a registration for 13-21-3 career points in Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the biggest golfers ever, who has won 14 major titles, just turned off Jack Nicklaus.
Team U.S. spent the whole weekend finding the fairways, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf with high precision throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk declared himself after a disappointing achievement for his squad, “I am proud of these men, they fought.
It was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves away.
The hat for Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We want to regroup, I want to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and I want to see in the future.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be your team captain.
You just need to take off your hat.
We were beaten.
