Politicians in Wales were afraid to look like fools.
There was horror among certain members of the Welsh National Assembly over a proposal that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It has arisen from plans to change the name of the House to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs from all over the political spectrum are concerned that the change in names could give rise to ridicule.
A member from the party Labour said his group was concerned because “it rhymes with Twp and Pwp —
To readers outside Wales: In Welsh means twp silly, and pwp means shit.
One member from the party Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole was not satisfied and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said that his group was “open” to the name change, but noted that there is only a short verbal leap from MWP to Muppet (fjols).
In this context the Welsh letter w is spoken in the same way as the letter u is spoken in Yorkshire-English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drawing up a bill introducing the name changes, said: “The final decision on terms that Members of this House will have is, of course, up to Members themselves,
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals, with broad support for calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members (WMPs) or WMPs, but the MWP option received the greatest support in a public consultation.
AMs seem to propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus may prove difficult for the President of the House, Elin Jones, who is expected to put together a legislative proposal for the amendments within a few weeks.
The legislative proposal on reforms includes other changes in the way the House works, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs will have the final vote on what they will be called when the legislative proposal is debated.
Macedonians shall hold a vote on the change in the name of the country
The voters vote Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to “Republic of North Macedonia”
The vote will be taken in an attempt to resolve a decades of conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has for a long time insisted that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a demand for Greece's territory and has long protested against Macedonia's attempts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gerge Ivanov is opposed to the vote and says that he will reject the vote.
Fans of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in names is merely a price paid to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's remain quiet while the churches of Harlem fight
“The older people I spoke to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner,” said Mr. Adams.
Today, there's none of them.
He said it's understandable that the bars disappear.
“People socialize in other ways these days,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood, where people walk on a daily basis”
In relation to churches, he is concerned that the money that is made to sell assets does not last long and that, sooner or later, they are back where they started,
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes that are full of those kind of people who don't help the neighborhood's recurring sanctuary.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white,” he says, “and it is still breathing to the development where these churches finally close completely, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the property will become members of the churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolitan community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had worked nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black church under priest John Howard Johnson, who was at the head of a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the primary shopping streets in Harlem, who would not employ or promote black.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to restore the building, they ordered the bell.
The priest David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the bells of the poor.
The expert who played the bell game in June called it something else: “A cultural treasure — and an irreplaceable historical instrument —
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell game in the world that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger bell game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's found no substitute for him.
What has been happening in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated story about architects and entrepreneurs, some of which were captured by church leaders, others by the bishopship.
In July, the Council of Churches — the leading body of the parish, made up of leading laymen — wrote to the bishops about concerns that the bishops would try to push the expenses forward — to the Congregation Council, even though the Congregation Council had not been involved in recruiting the architects and entrepreneurs whom the bishops sent in.
Some members complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the bishops.
Shark injuries 13-year-old on a diving trip after lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived after lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, says officials.
The attack just before 7:00 near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then along with a group paddled over to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just enthusiasm for having caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy cried, “I got bit!
I got bit.
“All his clavicles were torn up,” said Hammel, when he came to the boy.
“I cried out that everyone should come out of the water, ‘There is a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was reported in critical condition.
It's not clear what kind of shark was attacking.
The lifesaver Larry Giles said by a media briefing that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the route from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons and to conduct investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to take up the beauty market in Britain
Sainsbury's takes up competition with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with rows of beauty products with special assistants in the style of department stores.
As part of a major effort to consume Britain's beauty market, which has a value of GBP 2.8 billion and continues to grow, while fashion and housing products fall. The larger rows of beauty products are tested in 11 shops around the country and launched in several shops next year if they prove successful.
The investment in beauty products takes place as supermarkets look for new goods for shelves previously used for television, microwave ovens and housing products.
Sainsbury's says they double their selection of beauty products for 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, introduced for the first time.
The existing range of products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also has more space with branded areas in style with them, one sees in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunches the range of Boutique make-up, so most of the products are suitable for veganers - something that is increasingly required by younger shoppers.
The first opened in Croydon in southern London last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a development against buying small quantities of food daily by local merchants mean that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury's, has said that stores are going to look like department stores, as the supermarket chain takes up the fight with the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales sites in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales sites since they bought both chains two years ago.
The previous Supermarket attempt to update beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint action with Boots in the early 00s, but the cooperation ended up with a dispute as to how the earnings from the pharmacy in the supermarkets were to be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy chain with 281 stores to Celesio, who owns Lloyd's Pharmacy chain, for 125 GBP three years ago.
According to the strategy Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding a further range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury, said: “We have changed the appearance and interior of our range of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available for advice.
Our selection of brands is designed to suit all needs and the consuming environment and the practical locations mean that we are now a convincing destination that challenges the old way of shopping
Peter Jones-raising - after Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement to GBP 11 million
Dragons' Den-star Peter Jones left behind - after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement to GBP 11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time for their product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop Fire.
This Morning host, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she is leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den-star Peter Jones furious, after she withdraws from their greedy lifestyle fire at the last minute - to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was “ravelling” when during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, her new agreements, with a value of up to GBP 1.5 million, meant that she no longer had enough time for their residential product and accessories fire Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of GBP 11 million.
Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she left Truly while Jones flew out of Britain to one of her holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project which she would have to deal with in the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday.
There is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow headquarters, which is already ready for sale.
Experts estimate that the announcement from this Morning host, which is among Britain's top earning stars, can cost the company several million because of large investments in products - from pillows to candles to clothing and household products - and the potential for further delays in the launch.
And that can also be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby and the master Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as Chairman of the Board of Directors in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall be the fire ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, \"We couldn't comment on his business actions...
Hard talk, and then we fell in love.
He made fun of the criticism he would receive from the news media to give a comment which “is not worthy of President — and to be so positive to the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his parody on a newscast.
I didn't give up anything.
He noted that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump proclaimed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a “equivalent reaction” from the United States in relation to North Korea’s initial measures against disarmament.
He noted that instead the United States continues with sanctions aimed at keeping pressure on the road.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view in the speech at his election meeting.
He said North Korea is doing very well.
There was an uproar to war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a wonderful relationship.
He said that his attempt to improve the relationship with Kim had produced positive results — termination of rocket tests, help with the release of hostages and the return of remains from U.S. soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
“It’s so easy to act stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this densely packed arena, we would have about 200 people standing there,” Trump said, pointing to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquakes wreak havoc and kill hundreds
In the post-Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organisations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population were homeless, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for calling for international emergency aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases it has been clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so it is a little challenging,” said Sumbung.
While Save the Children put together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutpo, national disaster response spokesman, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the emergency response.
Because of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly being subjected to, it is very poorly prepared for natural disasters.
There are built Tsunami resorts in Aceh, but they are not a common view of other coastlines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but it appears to be missing a tsunami, and it has probably affected the death toll.
Even in the best of conditions, it is challenging to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's poor infrastructure a central point in his campaign and he has spent a lot of money on roads and train routes.
But Mr Joko's administration has been plagued by lack of funding as the election campaign next year.
Mr Joko is also experiencing pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken on a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were removed from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, bow and arrow and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge compensates in the last moment against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League to Chelsea with a score in the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a drop off from Xherdan Shaqiri small 30 meters from Chelsea's target while his team was backwards with 1-0.
He pointed to the ball with his left foot before making a high shot at the farthest pole.
The ball flew high over the field towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was just about getting into the position of getting the ball. Players like Shaq are always trying to get as far forward as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, and I made a single touch, and I didn't think much about it, and I just took the shot.
Chelsea led 1-0 at the semi- lay, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25 minute.
The Chelsea Angriber delivered with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic before he speeded up on the midway and sprinted into the Liverpool runway half.
Kovacic made a quick one-two on the midway.
He then made a long drop that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defense and ended up at the farthest post with a shot with the left foot past the Liverpool Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights Naples in the group game of the Champions League at 15 Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.

Death rates from tsunami in Indonesia are rising to 832
The death rate from Indonesia’s earthquakes and tsunami has risen to 832 reports the country’s emergency preparedness early Sunday.
Many prisoners were reported in the rubbles from buildings that fell after the earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the richter scale. It hit Friday and created up to 6 meters high waves, the spokesman Sutpo Purwo Nugroho told at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a man of 32 suspected of murder after a woman daggers to death
A murder investigation has started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with a stab wound at 755 at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested suspected of murder.
The police have urged people in the area who saw or heard something about stepping forward.
Police officer Brian O'Hagan said: “We are in the early stages of the investigation, but I would urge anyone who stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I would also like to invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken something with Dashcam, to contact us, as they may have information that can be crucial to the investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrive on the spot to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and the police say they are in the process of informing the victims' relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment but is told by the police that no one can enter the building.
He was paralyzed when he heard what had happened.
People are now being told that it takes several hours for them to get back in.
A police officer was overheard telling a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman arrives.
She keeps repeating, \"It's so horrible,
At 14 p.m., there were two police cars in the area of the lockdown and another car just outside.

Parliament's statue of Cromwell will be the latest memorial, which will be the subject of discussion on the rewriting of history.
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts that were carried out by his fanatical, puritanic followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as \"madness\" and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in connection with the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace at Westminster would be a goal.
The picture storm during the English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for his forefather Thomas' actions in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's amazing representation of Cromwell is a testimony to attitudes in the 19th century and part of historiography of a figure which many still think is worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate image is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is absolutely certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognisable figure representing one side of the struggle.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering.
Killer pig attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China according to local media reports.
The man, who is only identified under his surname “Yuan — was found dead with a bloated artery and wrapped in blood near a pigpath on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farm is preparing to give pigs injections of vaccines using pigs on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had allegedly traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pigpath next door was open.
He said that in the pigpath there was a big, blood in his mouth.
A forensic study confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had bitten the farmer to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and injured,” said the cousin, under the surname “Wu — in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings from security cameras showed that Yuan went into the market at 4.40 Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One manager of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while the police collect evidence at the crime scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
It belongs to the rare units, but there are previously registered cases where pigs have attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a pig of 295 kg was forced to a Welsh farmer against his tractor, into his wife's house, scaring the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba CBC News told that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a \"trigger\"
They're just medically ill.
They're naked, they're very curious... they're not trying to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect, he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa are expected to give heavy rain in large parts of the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it moves over the cooler waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will give heavy rain with floods in northern Mexico and southwest America over the coming days.
Rosa had won at 38 m/s, a category 1 hurricane, at 10 Sunday (Danish time) and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure ventriloquist across the Pacific Ocean, which is moving east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula Baja California Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push tropical moisture north into the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm rain in parts of Mexico Monday.
Then the tropical moisture will interact with the low-pressure outlet that comes closer and create heavy rain in the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storm floods, floating falls and possibly landslides in the desert.
The tropical moisture will create rain with up to 51 to 76 mm of rain per hour locally, especially in parts of the southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm of rain is expected in parts of the South-West USA, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There is a high probability of rapid deterioration in storm tides due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It would be a very bad idea to move into the desert on foot when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can transform canyons into rolling rivers and thunder will create powerful local winds and create dust blows.</seg>
The approaching low pressure outlet will provide heavy rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total rainfall exceeding 13 mm, which may result in smaller amounts of liquid falls and smooth roads.
This would be the region's first rainfall in their rainy season.
Spreading tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners Tuesday area and continue Wednesday.
In October there can be large temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences through Central America Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the Central and Eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start on October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.</seg>
It could be up to 26 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long climate view indicates that there is a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million saw Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
Over 20 million saw Thursday's gripping testimony from the nominee to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle continued with stations that interrupted the general programmes to tell about Friday's late development: An agreement composed by Senator from Arizona Jeff Flake, which allowed the FBI to conduct a week's investigation of the charges.
Ford told the senate's judicial committee that she's 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was intoxicated with her and tried to take her clothes off for a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he's 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that, according to Nielsen, 20.4 million saw it on Friday.
The company listed average ratings at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
No viewing numbers were immediately available from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems measuring how many people see programs in offices.
To put it in perspective, it is a ratings that correspond to a match during the NFL playoffs or Oscar distribution.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-borne hosts strongly backed up the appointment of Kavanaugh, lay at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing that lasted all day, said Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.44 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2,52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement stating that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught for open CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning, while protestors yelled at him when he tried to take an elevator to the hearing on the judicial committee.
He was standing with his eyes down for several minutes while he was being reviled, and CNN sent live.
I'm standing right here in front of you, said a woman.
You think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that you have so much power and so many women are powerless.
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing on the committee.
All the television stations covered live hours later, when the judicial committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should proceed to a vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said that he would only vote in favour of the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee in the next week, which the Democrats, who are in the undersales of the Senate, had asked for.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a series of senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flakes' choice had an impact because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of \"learn politics\" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU in order to \"learn politics\" with Britain's future and undermine national interests.
United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain on 29 September 2018.
In a second interview with Theresa May on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson presented her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was “all ridiculous”
Shooting at Wayde Sims: The police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being behind the LSU player's death
The police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and imprisoned, suspected of accidental manslaughter, said the police in Baton Rouge.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the battle.
The police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on, reported the CBS daughter company WAFB.
After the questioning of Simpson, the police said he confessed to the shooting on Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, reporting the lawyer.
The coroner of the East Baton Rouge Parish issued an interim report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a wound from a gun shot from his head to his neck.
Police Department says that a task force from Louisiana State Police, State Police, Southern University Police, and local citizens have assisted the investigation that led to the arrest.
The head of the sports team at LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police in the area for their Omhu and the pursuit of justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
Friday morning, the basketball coach at LSU, Will Wade, said the team was \"knuste\" and \"shocked\" over Wayde's death.
“That’s the kind of thing you’re always afraid of,” said Wade.
Volcano Spews Ash Over Mexico City
Ash vomited from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
The national disaster prevention centre warned on Saturday Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity occurred in the crater and 183 gas and ash discharges were recorded within 24 hours.
The center watched the rum and tremors over several rounds.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car routes in neighbourhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometres southeast of the capital since an earthquake, which measured 7.1 on the Richter scale, shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police come across with Catalan separatists prior to the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after demonstrators who want independence, coincided with intruders as thousands participated in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of the polarizing vote of Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists held intruders back, threw along and powder painting and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There was also a fight later on the day when the police used their poles to keep the fights down.
Over the course of several hours, independence groups called out — nothing forgotten, nothing forgiven — and met Unionist demonstrators who cried out — Long live Spain —
14 people were treated for minor injuries that occurred during the protests, reported the local press.
The atmosphere remains high in the less-favoured region one year after the vote on 1 October, which was declared illegal from Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters voted overwhelmingly for independence, but the election connection was low, and those who opposed the break-up boycotted the vote in a large way.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year, after the police tried to stop the vote during violent clash at voting stations throughout the region.
Independence groups had camped the night by Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer dares to hope that Catalonia can achieve independence.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy having had the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck,\" he said.
Although they had a narrow but important victory in regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum, and many of their best-known leaders have either moved into exile or sat in denition awaiting judgment for their role in holding the vote and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, took up protests on his phone to support the police and said that the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
“There’s getting bigger and bigger tensions,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders, who has been awaiting his trial since last year, announced that he would be running for elections to the European Parliament next year.
“The position as a candidate in European elections is the best way to avoid the setback in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish Government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested, after houses hit by car

The event happened in Ballynagard Crescent Thursday around 19.30 BST.
Officer Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow might have been fired against the car at some point.
Shots from Menga give Livingston victory on 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
The recorders Livingston surpassed the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mengas shot made the difference when Gary Holt's team moved up side by side with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team has not won on the outskirts of the league this season and will meet the leading team of Hearts, which they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will be visited by Rapid Vienna in the Europe League Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, extends their undefeated stripe to six games, and chief coach Holt has still not been defeated since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston's missing chances against cash stay
Holt’s team should have been ahead of long before, they scored, and their direct playing style created major problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but delivered across the line in front of the goal, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the target, after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's cross-cutting header in front of the target.
The home team was content to let Rangers play in front of them because they knew that they could give unheld problems in deathball situations.
And it was under the conditions that the important goal came.
Rangers made a free kick, and Livingston utilized an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created together the setup for Menga, which made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
At that time, Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but struggled to get through the domestic defense, and goalman Liam Kelly was virtually not challenged.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was averted with the feet of the Rangers goalman Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame under another of Livingston's deathball situations.
There were continuous deliveries into Livingston's field, but were averted, and two demands for a criminal park — after Halkett's tackle on the replacement Glenn Middleton and one by hand on the ball — were rejected.
“Peneomenal” from Livingston’s analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal efforts and strong results for Livingston.
Everyone played fantasticly and exceeds expectations of their upward journey.
Their playing style and troubles are largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but a large part of the honor must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he entered.
There were a lot of heroes.
Commander Halkett was amazing and led a well-organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worall on their toes throughout the battle.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
They have at times been really good under Gerrard, but they played below level.
Their endings lacked sharpness - only once had they exposed the home team - and it is a steep awakening for the Rangers, located in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cool
There were smiles and blue skies Saturday (29 September), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to improve relations with the two NATO members.
There has been disagreement over areas such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's approach to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Køln to open a new, large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police held for security reasons a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but lots of supporters appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents — many of them Kurdish — were also noted and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German Government's decision to accept in the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as a hero of some German Turks and ridiculed as an autocrat by others.
Accident on the way in Deptford: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist is dead in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred close to the crossing between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwest of the city around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and there was a rescuer on site, but the man died on site.
The accident happens a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car whose driver escaped from the place, on Childrens Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said police officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road barriers have been set up, bus routes have been replaced and motorists are encouraged to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin Prison.
According to Prison Office, six prison officers are injured in distress in a high-security prison.
There was unrest in the prison HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9.30 BST Sunday, and the unrest is still in progress.
Specialized Tornado officers have been brought in to handle the riots involving eight inmates and are in one wing of the prison.
Officers were treated for minor face injuries at the site.
A spokesman for Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison staff are inaugurated to deal with current disturbances in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear about the fact that those responsible are notified to the police and may end up spending longer behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the prison inspector was treated at the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, alarm guards were called to prison to deal with serious disturbances in which employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm floods (drier areas can benefit)
It is rare for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona, but it is most likely at the beginning of next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa are moving across the desert landscape of the South-West United States and creating a risk of storm flood.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings of storm floods on Monday and Tuesday in Western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones had preserved the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km of the Arizona border
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm of rain with isolated quantities up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to get 25 to 51 mm with the option of 102 mm locally.
For them outside the risk of storm floods Rosas rain can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will be useful because the South West United States is currently experiencing drought.</seg>
According to the United States drought surveillance, just over 40 percent of Arizona experience extreme drought, the second highest category, reports weather.com.
First Hurricane Rosa is expected to hit land on the peninsula Baja California in Mexico.</seg>
Rosa still has hurricane strength Sunday morning with maximum wind force of 38 m/s and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north by 19 km/h.
The storm meets cooler waters in the Pacific and is therefore falling in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit in Mexico with tropical power on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain of parts of Mexico can become powerful and give a great risk of flooding.
“It is expected that there will be a total of 76 to 152 mm of rainfall from Baja California to the northwest Sonora with an option of up to 254 mm — reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the Arizona border early in the morning Tuesday as a tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into the southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
“The primary expected danger from Rosa or the remains of it is very heavy rain in Baja California, the northwest Sonora and the United States’ southwest desert region,” reported the National Hurricane Center.
The rains are expected to create life-threatening storm floods and floating falls in deserts as well as landslides in mountain terrain.
Attacks in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested suspected of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The Teenage Boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 4 BST Saturday.
He was brought to the hospital where his condition reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, the police in Avon and Somerset say.
Officers have invited all persons who may have mobile recordings of the incidents to arrive.
Trump says Kavanaugh was under the democratic party's evil and anger.
“A vote on Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and rude tactics of the Democratic Party,” said Trump at a election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been subjected to “the evil, the anger” of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave a statement in front of the Congress on Thursday and denied strong and emotional accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually abused her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave an explanation of the testimony at the hearing of his charges.
The president said Saturday that the American people saw the skill, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
“A voice at the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that confirms one of the finest legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a fantastic past in public service,” he said to a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh while he spoke of the importance of Republicans meeting up in the ballots in the mid-term elections.
“In five weeks, one of the most important choices will be in our lifetime.
You can't vote for me, but you're actually voting for me, he said.
That's why I'm going around fighting for amazing candidates.
Mr Trump argued that the Democrats were on a mission to resist and block
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, has a person high in the Republican party told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquakes and tsunami, death to rise
At least 384 were killed, and many of them washed away by huge waves that hit the beach when a great earthquake and a great tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves hit the coast at dusk time, sucked many in death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake that measured 7.5 on the richter scale.
“When the tsunami occurred yesterday, people were still doing activities on the beach. They didn’t run immediately and became victims,” said Sutpo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster preparedness GDPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
“Tsunami did not come alone, the dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea by 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
More people managed to survive by climbing into trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The disaster alert has published air photography showing many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to be shaken by euthanasia on Saturday.
The row of earthquakes was marked in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Government of Indonesia for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) stated in a report that the energy triggered during Friday’s great earthquakes was about 200 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb that was dropped over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and it may have made the tsunami larger, said the board.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found trapped under the rubble from collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 had been injured and 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho said that the death rate and the injuries could be greater along the 300 km long coastline north of Palu, the area of Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
Communication “was completely paralysed without information — from Dongala, Nugroho said.
“There are over 300,000 people living here,” said Red Cross in a announcement, adding that their employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” they said.
The board of directors was criticised on Saturday from many fronts not to say that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said that the waves had come within the time when the warning was issued.
In amateur recordings shared on social media, one can hear a man on the top floor of a building who desperately shouts warnings of the tsuamia coming closer to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast and carries away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that cut off communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue effort.
The military has begun to send cargo aircraft with emergency assistance from Jakarta and other cities, reports authorities, but food and basic necessities are still urgently needed among the evacuated.
The airport of the city has been reopened but only for relief work and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death rate after Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's really bad.
World Visitors from Dongala have come safely to Palu city, where employees seek shelter under tarpaulins set up in the courtyard by their account. They came past areas with extensive destructions on the way, said Doseba.
“They told me that they were so many ruined houses, ” he said.
It's really bad.
Even when relief organisations began the harsh work of restoring relief work, complaints came that foreign relief workers with extensive expertise were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, financial support, supplies and staff from abroad must only enter if the area in which the accident has occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It is still a disaster at province level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for Indonesian red cross.
“When the government says ‘OK, it’s a national disaster, we can open up for international assistance, but there’s no status yet”
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing people held firm in the hope that their closest would be the miracles that brighten the dark tales of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Saturday rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paraglids of Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were caught at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were among his students.
“As a paragliding veteran, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon told me how he, in the hours, after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles, had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu who attended the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, resulted in only one gray fly leg instead of two blue.
I think that means the messages weren't delivered, he says.
Twenty takes USD 26,750 while filling up the ATM in Newport on the Levee
Twenty stole Friday morning 26,750 USD from a Brink's employee who was about to meet a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The car driver had emptied the ATM into the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, and Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran up behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag money that was supposed to have been delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on the identity of the thieves, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: “The site previously known as Kanye West,
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change takes place prior to his performance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yidhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande at the show, which canceled for “emotional reasons” said the show's creator.
The name is an abbreviated of his current artist name, but West has said in the past that the name has religious significance for him.
“I believe that ‘yes’ is the most frequently used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’, said West earlier in the year, where he discussed his album title with the Big Boy radio host.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to Just Ye, which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He's one of a number of famous rappers who've changed their name.
Sean Combs has changed between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former partners, JAY-Z, has also switched between small and large letters and changed whether or not the dash is included.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th year of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never ever use the military to suppress the Mexican people.
Tropper shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968 and killed up to 300 at a time when left-wing student movements took root in many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly government grants to students and opening more free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research within the field, says investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. Government have issued announcements on artificial intelligence. However, the United States still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced their plan last year and aims to take the lead in innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030.
“It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough in AI,” said Lee.
The doubling of the budget could double the chances of the next great achievement in artificial intelligence being achieved in the United States, told Lee to CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is CEO of the Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highest-ranking American Othello player, and later he became head of Microsoft Research and director of Google's department in China.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions supported by the US government, such as Robotics Challenge, which was held by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when a new competition would come, so that the next visionaries could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain scholarships from the government, says Lee.
“It’s not China that grabs the academic leaders, it’s the big companies,” said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years employed star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I believe that PhDs in artificial intelligence should have offered work permits automatically.
The Government of China issued their Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The China National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a way similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organisations' distribution of money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence to involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the foundation of Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests over USD 100 million a year in research into artificial intelligence.
However, American legislation trying to set up a national artificial intelligence security commission has been standing still for several months.
Macedonians shall hold a vote on the change in the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to “Republic of North Macedonia” - an action that would solve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province named Macedonia and maintains that the name of their neighbouring country towards the north constitutes a requirement for Greek territory and has therefore used their veto when Macedonia has applied for accession to NATO and to the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but Nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's primary Slavic population.
President Ivanov has said that he will not take part in the vote, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the range of voters will be the 50% required to make the vote valid.
The question on the ballot was: \"Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership, with agreement with Greece,
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price worth paying to create access to associations such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that arose as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I came here today to vote on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU umbrella, because it means more safe life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will comply with the result of the vote and apply it.
The name change would require a majority in Parliament of two thirds.
The State Election Commission said that at 13 a.m. no irregularities were reported.
However, the attendance rate was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
“I voted today because of my children. We belong in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a elector in the capital city of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko took part in the vote in Macedonia on a change in the country's name which would open up for membership of NATO and the EU, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and pulled chairs up in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the vote.
“We are for NATO and the European Union, but we want to get membership with the upped, not by the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of European-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would provide a heavily needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think that a large majority will vote in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the European Union and NATO,” Zaev said after giving their vote.
He said that a \"yes\" result would be a \"assured guarantee of our future,\"
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the vote - less than the required election.
Another poll made by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the vote shall be at least 50 % plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the prodigious government since it took place in May last year.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero fights throughout Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought Brighton's defense in Manchester Citys 2--Sea Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his score coming after 65 minutes.
The Argentinian attacker received a drop on the midway at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran fast past three Brighton defenders before he went on the open track.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He fought past one defender and then ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a delivery to the left and found Sterling.
The English forwarder used his first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to list Brighton goalman Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
“Aguero struggles with some problems with his feet,” told the City-Manager Pep Guardiola reporters.
We talked about him playing about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the moment.
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the immediate head start of the Premier League game.
That target came after 29 minutes.
Aguero received in that sequence the ball deep inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice drop along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before he led Sterling to the farthest post.
The Sky Blues forward poked the ball in the net just before it slipped past targets.
City fights Hoffenheim in the group game of the Champions League at 12:55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim in Germany.
Scherzer wants to drangle Rockies
Nationals are eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to take the castu on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still the possibility of participation in playoffs for Rockies, who have played a game more than Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
At least the Rockies held onto a wild-card square with a 5-2-ser over National's Friday night, but still have their first division title for good.
“Even if we have nothing to play for, we can go to the game knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest level among the audience here in Denver, and that the opponents would play at the very highest level I will face this year.
Why shouldn't I be excited to play under those conditions?
Nationals have not yet signed up for Sunday, but will probably put Scherzer in such a situation as the pitcher.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the spot for the 34th time, trained his throws on Tuesday and would pitche on Sunday, which is usually his rest day.
The right hand player from Washington is located on 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 inserts in this season.
Trump holds the election meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation of his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while he spoke of the importance of Republicans meeting in the ballots at the mid-term elections.
Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
It's one of the big ones - you can't vote for me, but you're actually voting for me. That's why I'm traveling around fighting for amazing candidates - he said.
Trump continued, “You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you can see it happening right now.
And they are determined to get the power back with all the available means. You can see how vicious, how repugnant they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to gain power and control.
The Democrats, he said, have, as a mission-strite against and block-
“And you have seen it over the last four days,” he said, “the Democrats” said, “wrathful and malicious and repugnant and lying”
He referred to the senior democratic senator of the Senate judicial committee Diane Feinstein by name, which triggered loudly the bow from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, wait a minute - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen -
Labour is no longer a spacious party.
They are intolerant of those who express their views.
Since Momentum's activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't really a surprise.
I am just the latest in a number of Labour MEPs who have been told that we are not welcome - alone because we have made our point known.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she took a strong distance from anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorage was to criticize me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically similar problems in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the call for a meeting in Nottingham East Labour on Friday it was stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive”
During most of my eight years as a local Member of Parliament, Friday evening meetings have just been that way.
Today, unfortunately, the tone of many meetings is not so, and the promise of “friendly, gentler” politics lies far back in the past if it ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that differing views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are weighed by whether the leadership of the party can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became a leader when colleagues, with whom I thought I was sharing political standing, began to expect me to make a U-turn and adopt positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with - whether it was about national security or the European Union's internal market.
When I say my opinion in the public - and that is not really what I am saying - a long strip of gross messages follow on the social media calling for the rejection and contradiction of the middle-seeking policy and telling me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments that are being made on me are usually political.
I have deep respect for professionalism and the willingness to fight among my colleagues, who are constantly engulfed in sex or racism, but still continue to fight.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should create a tolerant culture.
But in reality it is no longer a spacious organization and with each vote of censure or change of selection rules the party becomes narrower.
I've been getting a lot of advice over the last two years about that if I lay down my own head and I'm not that loud, then I'm gonna be okay.
But that is not why I went into politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago, when I was in school, I was provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, who had left our classroom in a state of decline, and I set myself to create better public services for those who most need it - whether it has been as a councillor or as a minister in the government.
I have never hidden my policy, nor in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the motion for a resolution on Friday, I would say that when the country turns towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the head of Labour.
But the one message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the local voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no kind of threat of diselection or political suitability will prevent me from acting out of what I think is your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unaccompanied Ayr becomes peak
Two late skates may have got the final result to draw a not quite truthful picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this fantastic entertaining match of the day in Tennent's Premiery.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard and are the only undefeated team of ten.
In the end, it was as much their superior defense as their better use of the chance that carried the home, and coach Peter Murchie had absolutely the right to be satisfied.
“Our battles have been demanding so far, and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Respect to Ayr, they took advantage of their chances better than we did.
Grant Anderson's score after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr ahead, but a yellow card to the Scottish national team player Rory Hughes, who was awarded for the fight by the Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a score, which was not followed up by a kick.
Climo expanded Ayr's behavior with a penalty park just before the half doctor. He scored and then got a solo scratch, so 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's score, followed up by a kick from Baggot, reduced the point difference to five.
There was then a long interruption because Ruaridh Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was carried out of the field on the stretcher. When the game was resumed, Ayr expanded the lead with a scratch from Stafford McDowall and a follow-up kick from Climo.
Working Ayr-Chief Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card, and again Melrose used their extra man with a score from Bruce Colvine without follow-up kick after a period of intense pressure.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson could after a line-out score behind the emerging Ayr cluster.
Climo followed up with a kick within the poles and followed up with a more soon after, the game was resumed after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent the pilot Gregor Henry to the fifth corner of the home track.
Still Game star looking for new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems to take the step towards the restaurant industry, after it came out that he has taken the post of director of an authorized restaurant business.
The 56-year-old, Jack Jarvis, plays in the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main character in along with his partner Greg Hemhill.
The Duo has announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's director of Akakmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but a source suggested to the Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of the Glasgow growing market for restaurants.
“The sea is ours”: Inland Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Seamen patrol the Navy headquarters, which is wrapped in rains, in La Paz.
In public buildings there is a sea blue flag.
Waterbases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are overpainted with the motto: “The sea is ours, it is a right.
It's a duty to take it back.
Throughout the Indian state of Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict about resources in the 19th century is still strong, and the same is the desire to sail on the Pacific again.
The hopes may be at their highest for decades, while Bolivia awaits a judgment from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of voting.
“Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and, of course, awaits with a positive look at the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country and hope that the Hague Court will agree to Chile’s obligation, after decades of discussion, to negotiate to grant Bolivia sovereignty over an area with access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president, who faces a controversial election campaign next year, also has a lot at stake at the verdict on Monday.
We're close to returning to the Pacific, he promised us in August.
But analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will take Bolivia’s party and that no major changes would occur if it did.
The UN Assembly, which has seats in the Netherlands, has no power to transfer Chilean territory and has been ad hoc to prevent it from determining the outcome of possible discussions.
That the International Court of Justice gives judgment only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case was “not complicated”, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have given setbacks.
“The story of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership,” Zárate said.
Morale's warlike rhetoric has put an end to the remaining Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the decision of the Court of Justice was unusually fast.
Monday, Bolivia will have an extraordinary opportunity to open up a new era of relations with Chile - and a chance to “end an era of 139 years with disagreements and gain benefits for both parties,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up access rights to the Pacific” he added.
“The judgment is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless they can trust the United States of America.
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says that his nation will never arm their nuclear weapons if they cannot first trust Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to respect the promises made during a Singapore Summit between the rival leaders.
His comments were repeated that the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo apparently faces a restart of the locked nuclear diplomacy over three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a “desirable dream” to continue sanctions and the US’s opposition to a declaration that ends the Korean war will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to declare as long as Pyongyang has not taken significant steps towards disarmament.
Kim and President Donald Trump both want another summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism compared to whether Pyongyang is serious in terms of abolishing an arsenal which the country most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Modeshows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large headgear, which you will soon be able to buy in local shops
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne raised on the catwalk veiled for a collection of strangely large headgear as part of their SS19 collection. The collection was impressed by the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have dominated Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
The most impressed work from Valentino was a lavish with a feather-like wide shadow covering the heads of models.
There were also other extra large accessories, including watermelons with jewels and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks - just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had joined lips that reminded me more of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like a snoring and masking diver, and others resembled a melted waffle.
And if you continue the big fashion states, you're lucky.
Stil scouts predict that the huge hats could get to shops near you.
The giant hats arrive in the heels of the La Bomba - the straw hat with a 60 cm wide shadow, which is seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratakowski.
The cool mark, which is behind the most impractical hatred spread over the social media, has sent a new great creation down the catwalk - a beach bag in straw that is almost as big as the model showing it.
The orange bass case with bass seeds and a white leather handle was the most eye-catching in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags in ordinary shops next summer. The designer has had such a great influence that it will be hard to ignore demand for accessories in huge sizes.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have many great academic achievements behind them, and it is still in 2018 with yet another unique exam results, which are even strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other efforts in the local environment.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their students and parents.
The independent schools are trying to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can put together and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we find that modern languages remain a popular topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it hits his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it hits the heart.
It is an important reminder that we cannot just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can look at the latest results this year, that languages are highest in statistics with the most completed exams in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign - language students received the A.
The data collected by SCIS’ 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of the students received the A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important competences, which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now perceived as subject-election at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and food-haematics) in independent schools' curriculum and elsewhere.
A study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills carried out in 2014 found that among the reasons why employers could not occupy vacancies, 17 % had language skills to do.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
More job opportunities will in future require language skills, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career young people choose, if they have learned another language, they have a great advantage in the future with a life-long skill like this.
The possibility of communicating directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a head start to competitors.
According to a YouGov poll with over 4,000 requests in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multidigit percent, 15 percent.
It is therefore important to invest in language teaching to those who are children today.
When you can speak more languages, especially those from developing countries, children give a better chance to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, schools differ in which languages are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most important for Britain when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and provides them with the skills needed to achieve success, regardless of what the future holds.
At this stage, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be really important for the country's future in a global business environment and must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be regarded as international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this distinction to Scotland's youth.
I faut bien le faire.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron gets debut for Lakers Sunday in San Diego
Wait time is almost over for fans who will watch LeBron James play his first game for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James is playing in Sunday's opening game before the season starts against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it is not yet fixed how many minutes he plays.
“It’s more than 1 and less than 48,” said Walton on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James most likely won't play the whole game.
After the training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans in relation to Lakers' planned six matches before the season start.
“Where I am in my career, I don’t have to fight before the season starts to get ready,” he said.
Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a stripe election meeting tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first out of five scheduled election meetings next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on the confirmation of Trump's appointed judge for the seat of the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump tries to support the forthcoming mid-term elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when the votes are cast in November.
When is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump’s election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is held at midnight (Danish time) night between Saturday 29 November and Sunday 30 November 2018.
You can see Trump's election meeting in West Virginia online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely be talking about this week's hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court.
But the primary objective of this stripe election is to create momentum for the Republicans who are faced with a difficult choice in November.
The people of President Trump’s campaign team said that next week’s five election meetings are aimed at “creating energy among volunteers and supporters when the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives” according to Reuters.
“Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible now that we enter the busy campaign time,” said a spokesman for the Trump campaign, which would not be quoted by name, to Reuters.
The election meeting of the evening is held in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month, Trump has visited West Virginia, the state, he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to step up to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, who deals with political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team The United States has shown off and tries to keep hope alive before Sunday’s singles
After three one-sided rounds, the Saturday's four-man duells might be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but a concept that players believe - not least in competitions such as this one.
Where would they say there's momentum now?
“They scored six points, and now it’s four, so we’ll probably see that as a momentum,” said Jordan Spieth, before he had his night off.
Of course, Europe has the advantage: they are 4 points ahead and there are 12 more points to play about.
As Spieth says, however, Americans feel that they have a bit of wind in the sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, especially the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both can boast with three points of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The loud shouts of cheer grew as the round went on, and Spieth struck an important pillow that secured victory in duel four, although he and Thomas had been two battles behind after two duells.
His pillow, which secured them the fight in hole 15, met with a similar scream — the kind of scream that shows that he does not think the American team is out of the competition yet.
“You just need to find the inner strength forward and focus on your own fight,” said Spieth.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the biggest story from Ryder Cup.
Europe's remarkable, but sympathetic couples have gained four points in four battles and appear to be faultless.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who didn’t get a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Bogey’s Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way the energy appears to flow both to and from the wild audience, shows that it is them that it will be most difficult to beat Sunday. And it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory were set by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Mostly in sync on each of their holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process against Sergio Garcia, the morning completely in the four-man duells when he formed couples with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes dug the Spanish and the Swede into a hole they were never near to get out of.
Sunday, no one can help you get out of your hole.
The battles with four balls and two teams a two players are so fascinating to look at close team because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can quickly change.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a significant lead before the last day, but the four-man pigeons have also shown that the Team United States has the battle spirit which some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe will create 10-6 for the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe has a great advantage before the last day at Ryder Cup, after they came out of Saturday's four-balls and foursomes with a run over the United States of America at 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two wins over a troubled Tiger Woods and have so far got four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, trying to win the Pocal they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an unprecise American team in the morning of four-balls and won the 3-1 series.
The United States gave more resistance in foursomes. They won four fights, but they were still behind.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12 single matches if they're going to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant who has won four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who together have been nicknamed \"Moliwood\", are after a sensational weekend the only other couple in Ryder Cup's history who have won four points in their first four fights.
They crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls and then beat elegantly a discouraged Woods and the American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought through the first two games Saturday, had little brilliant glimpses, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 fights in the fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well rested for the morning four-balls and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in four-somes and got a 2--ser over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, which is number three in the world.
Europe, however, has quite the right to have it on a slightly windy day south-west of Paris.
Triple major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans by two points Saturday.
They got a hard-on 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four balls and returned later and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the Ryder Cup story that a team has fought back after being behind with four points before the single combat. However, as Furyks currently has the cup, they must only achieve a tie in order to keep it.
Having been second best for two days, however, it seems that they cannot master a counterattack Sunday.
North Korea says that they will not dissipate unilaterally if there is no confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions reinforce their distrust of the United States and that the country will not give up their nuclear weapons unilaterally under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the Worldwide Organization that North Korea had shown “significant goodwill” over the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, running an area for nuclear tests and promising not to further develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we haven’t seen a similar reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security and under such conditions there is no chance that we ourselves will take the first steps and dissipate unilaterally.”
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a “phase-divided” approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps. However, his speech seemed important as it did not unequivocally reject unilateral disarmament, as otherwise had been the case from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint announcement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever between a seated American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work “atomic disarmament on the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has asked for a formal end to the Korean war, which took place in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown resistance to softening international sanctions against North Korea.
“The US insists on ‘atomic disarmament first’ and extends the pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose by force and even opposes the ‘declaration of the end of the war’,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream among people who don’t know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions reinforce our distrust.
The Ri did not mention plans for a summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: “If the nuclear disarmament were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so closed”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ris' speech was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that firing North Korea's rockets against the US mainland was inevitable, after \"Mr. Evil President\" Trump called Kim a \"rocked man\" on suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened the United Nations with “total destruction” of North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for showing courage in terms of disarmament, but said that there is still much to be done and that the sanctions have to remain until North Korea is dissipated.
Wednesday, Trump said that he did not have a timetable for these actions but said, “It doesn’t matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months,”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary for Foreign Affairs Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council must maintain the sanctions with conviction and without mistake until we achieve the total, final, confirmed nuclear disarmament”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons programme.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sideline during the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, while North Korea only a few hours later accused him of silently demanding
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile facility and a nuclear complex if the United States took similar steps
He said that Kim had told him that the “equivalent steps” he demanded were the safety promises that Trump gave in Singapore, as well as the movement towards a normalization of the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take the course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all the bachelor students more sleep. The purpose of the course is to counteract the growing macho culture where you study all night sustained by large amounts of caffeine.
A researcher has shown that students at the world's best university often don't know the first thing about looking out for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has completed the course, which, he believes, is the first of his kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the course after giving a presentation on the effects of lack of sleep on learning.
“ After the program was finished, a girl came up to me and said: “Why do I only get to know this now when I’m at the candidate?
“She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is offered for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleeping habits can improve one's academic and sporting performance as well as one's overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University's Health Area, says that the University has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in serious lack of sleep during the week.
The hourly course consists of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises there is a picture of a dorm room where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to get knowledge of the effects of caffeine and light, and how your sports performance is influenced by lack of sleep and how important good sleeping habits are.
In another part of the course, participants hear about how long sleep shortages increase the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to reflect on their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map of campus.
We know that this will not change the behaviour of students right away.
But we think they have the right to know - just as one has the right to know how cigarettes affect health - Professor Czeisler adds.
The pride that is in taking a “allnighter” still exists, he says and adds that modern technology and increased pressure on students have led to sleep shortages being a growing problem.
The “secret weapon” — against stress, fatigue and anxiety is good and sufficient sleep, he said — it even counteracts weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the brain think that you are starving, why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiar who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler in the course last year when he took one of his courses at Harvard's first year.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and made him work on making it a general course at all universities.
He hopes that the next one will be that all the graduates will be offered a similar course before continuing their training.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm so that they know when to go to bed and when to get up. This can raise awareness of the harmful effects of light from electronic screens that can move at daily rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Measures from Menga lower Gerard and co.
Rangers suffered another defeat on the outskirts, as Dolly Mengas’s goal meant that Steven Gerrard’s uncontinuous team had to go to thank with a defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was looking for their first victory on the outbound since 4-1-trium at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard the only second defeat in 18 games as coach. Thus, there are eight points up to Hearts at the first place by Ladbrokes Premiery.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, which a uninspired Ranger team could not respond to.
Rangers now go down to a sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to a third place after Hibernian with only the finish score to the difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to Rangers, as the line judges Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head by a thrown item that seemed to come from the outskirts.
Gerrard made eight changes in the layout that reached the Betfed Cups semifinal by tons past Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, with the same 11, who shaved a point of Hearts's behavior last week, and he would have been delighted to see his sharp team exhausting the opponents all over the track.
Rangers had the ball the most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should've scored two minutes inside the game when Menga's first drop sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfield player's attempt passed by.
A bar park in depth from Keaghan Jacobs found its way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense player Alan Lithgow kicked past the rear post.
The Rangers took control, however, but played more on hope than they could in the attack game.
Alfredo Morales was not at least satisfied when Judge Steven Thomson, when he and Steven Lawless, subordinated the columbian's appeals about the penalty park when he and Steven Lawless crashed together after 15 minutes' play.
Rangers managed only two shots on target in the first half, but former Rangers' goalman Liam Kelly had no problem with Lassana Coulibly's headshot and Ovie Ejaria's domestic shot.
Although Livis's opening in the 34th minute was something random, it must be said to be deserved for their efforts alone.
Again, Rangers couldn't handle a death ball situation in depth from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took the time to find Menga that could easily kick it in target.
In the pause, Gerrard Coulibaly replaced with Ryan Kent, which almost instantly gave a pot when the player sent the ball into Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the stand to play on their conclusions with many long balls up the track from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have extended the lead in the last part of the battle, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with a safe hand before Lithgow headed next to the goal.
Rangers' entry into Glenn Middleton again appealed for a late penal park after being dried along with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked here the other way.
Årbok: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the yearbook “Sunday Morning ”: 30 September, 1882, 136 years ago today — if we TELLER... — was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm-Hans-Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would eventually lead to the apparatus known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has become a solid component of both science and popular culture, as could be seen in the film “Bells of Coronado — 1950, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans had the leading roles as peasant scientists:
Man: “What in the world is that?
Rogers: “It’s a geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals does.
Evans: “Stop it, now it’s going on.
He died in 1945, a few days before he would have turned 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see — cancer cells
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to “see — cancer cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognise cancer cells during treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory.
They can then see - the protein that is common to many cancers and where they are injected again
A test vaccine is promising in patients with a number of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from patients and change them in the laboratory so that they can “see” the protein named HER2 that many cancers have and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.
HER2 - causes several forms of cancer to develop - including breast, egg, lung and intestine cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, in which immune cells are taken out of patients and “learning” them to attack cancer cells, has been effective in the treatment of a certain type of leukaemia.
Kanye West gave Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL performance.
It didn't go well.
After an inconsistency performance in the Saturday Night Live study Kanye West was driven by when he hailed U.S. president Donald Trump, and said that he himself would be running for president in 2020.
When he had played the third song of the evening Ghost Town wearing a Make America Great Against Against Against the Democrats, he started a thunderous speech and maintained his support for the Trump.
“I often talk to white people who say, ‘Why do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
But if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved away long ago from the United States, he said.
SNL started tonight's show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Legal Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's assault charges.
Even though the footage was not shown, comedian Chris Rock Wests was uptight on the social media.
It's uncertain whether Rock tried to exhibit West by putting the footage up.
West also complained to the audience over poor treatment backstage because of its head covering.
They bullied me backstage.
They said, \"Don't go out there with that hat on.\"
They bullied me!
And they said I was sunk deeply, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see how deep I have sunk, and said that he would wear his Superman hat, because that means that “you can’t decide what to do. Do you want progress in the world?
Try Love.
The audience bowed at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff seemed to be embarrassingly affected, according to Variety with a comment from a person who was present: “There was a toll in the study.
West had been booked as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many by performing with the song I Love It while he was dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candice Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest people: DO NOT LET YOUR COURSE OF THE PUBLISH —
Talkshow host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just as he was, and that's fine.
“But I don’t choose to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothing, or support his art — who embraces and bestows an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And so have we, she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced that he has changed his name to the identity officially known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to have changed his name, and thus follows Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapcolleagues Snoop Dogg has been called Snoop Lion, and the newly deceased musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Knowledge as Prince.

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington dealer out after toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for swinging swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor is pushing for the stereotyping macho hero and saying that these kind of TV characters mean that young men often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
Kit told the Sunday Times Culture that he thinks something has gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem lies in his mind.
“At present I am very concerned — where have we gone wrong in the city with masculinity,” he said.
“If we look at the current problems, what is it, we have taught young men in their childhood?
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is born for?
What are the young men learning from television and on the street that make them feel that they should be men in this way?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
Because it is obvious that something has gone wrong for the young men -
During the interview, he also admitted that he would not make successors to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer and said that he is “full with battlefields and horses”
Kit participates from November in a rerecording of Sam Shepards True West, which is the story of a film director and his brother, who is the thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers it to have met his wife Rose as the best thing about the entire Game of Thrones experience.
“I met my wife because of this series, so it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever,” he said.
Rose played Ygrite, as Kit's character, Jon Snow, falls in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's country estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has published a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, says the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China because of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV this way has been reduced to something near zero, says Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
In one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China's LGBT environment.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalized, but discrimination against LGBT people is allegedly a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry women sooner or later because of the country's conservative values.
Many cases of infection are caused by a lack of contraception in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denys that staff leaked data on Republican senators and thunders against dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
Member of the Representatives' House Maxine Waters denied in Saturday's accusations that a member of her staff has shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The democrat of Los Angeles claimed that the claims came from websites and support the “extreme right”
“Lows, lies, and several horrible lies” wrote Waters in a Twitter turnout.
The published information allegedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of the U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill. It happened during a hearing in the Senate regarding allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support pages like Gateway Pundit of RedState announced that the IP addresses pointed out that the information had been posted by Waters' people, after which they published information about a member of Waters staff, writes The Hill.
“This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie — continued Waters.
“Member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, is by no means responsible for this leak of information.
This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie.
Waters' release quickly got criticism online, including from a former press secretary in the White House Ari Fleischer.
It's an angry denial, wrote Fleischer.
This suggests she doesn't have the right temper to be a congressman.
If you are accused of something you have not done, you must not be angry.
You can't become defiant.
The motives of the prosecutor are not to be questioned.
You have to keep your mind calm.
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' response to the democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, who was criticized for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to take over Waters' place in the mid-term elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
Great, if that's true, he was tweeting.
In Waters' official announcement, she says her staff has contacted the relevant authorities and the orderly forces regarding these fraudulent claims.
“We want to make sure that the perpetrators are found,” she continued. “And that they will be held legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone and everyone in my staff.
Review by Johnny English strikes again — an overwhelming spy comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all recent films with a British impact, and it also seems relevant for the latest action comedy in Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will arid sarcastic self-satire be the country's new export potential?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and the big eyes have got his permission to make roars again again. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comic finding aimed at places where the cinema visitors do not speak English.
He is, of course, the silly secret agent who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a bit of Clouseau, a knife point Mr. Bean and a proper cloth by him who performed a single tone to the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of the Olympics in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the worldwide and international sneaker pants that left chaos in its wake, after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television commercials.
There are some good moments in this latest shot at the tribe of JE.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the propellers were sounding at his helmet.
You can see Atkinson’s talent for physical comedians, but the humor feels quite overwhelming and strangely redundant, especially now that more “serious” films like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer convincing comics as an ingredient.
The sense of humor seems to be directed towards children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's crazy adventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent movie show in the role of Mr. Bean.
The infinitely current starting point for the film is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An Internet hacker has infiltrated England's top secret spy network and exposed the identities of all English agents in the field to the horror of the responsible agent - an unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for a poppy and combatable Prime Minister who is already suffering a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing his best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the manuscript.
As her security advisers inform her that every active spy has been exposed, she is forced to cancel anyone's pension.
And of course it's the clumsy Johnny English, who is now a school principal at a high-class school, but who in secret teaches how to become a secret agent. There are some fun sequences here when English stands for some kind of school of Rock-training in espionage.
English haste back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunite with its hard-toughed earlier right hand Bough, which is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now been married to an overentusiastic but well-meaning submarine captain - a role that was wasted by Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, as they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful five-female, Ophilia Bulletova, the Royal Intelligence Service is completely independent.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is stumbled by the charismatic and scary tech-milliardary Jason Volta — the game of Jake Lacy — who claims to be able to solve England's computer problems.
English and Bough start their furiously risky escapades: disguised as servants, they set fire to a noble French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English creates pure  Ohok as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with Volta's house.
All the cannons are fired off in the film's final sequence, but no matter how well-meaning and energetic it is, there's a sense of child television about it.
Pretty mediocre.
And as I couldn't help thinking with the other Johnny English movies: Can the English film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that gives justice to his talent?
Labour refuses to carry out a four-day work week plan with unchanged pay to the British
Jeremy Corbyns Labour is said to consider a radical plan so that the English can settle for a four-day working week, but get paid for five.
The party allegedly wants business leaders to use their artificial intelligence (AI) savings to give employees an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would have a three-day weekend without going into pay.
Sources say that the idea would be consistent with the party's economic objectives of drawing the country in a more favourable direction for the workers.
Trade Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party said to The Sunday Times: “A political proposal is expected to be published by the end of the year”
“It will not happen in one day, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits with the party’s approach to changing the economy to the advantage of the workers and to the party’s overall strategy for industry”
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the election campaign for the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the aim is not supported unanimously by the Labour Party.
The Labour Party spokesperson said: “A four - day working week is not the party’s policy and is not under consideration in the party.
Labour's shadow finance minister John McDonnell spent last week's party meeting drawing up his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell says he's determined to take power back from ananonymous executives and exploiters in supply companies.
The shadow finance minister's plans also sowed doubts as to whether the current shareholders of water supply companies will get their money back, as a government with Labour could “reject” them on the basis of immoral acts.
He also confirmed plans to get employees on corporate boards and to set up including equity funds, which will distribute 10 percent of the equity value of private companies to employees who are to receive up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their voice
The FBI investigation into accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court with at least a week, and it raises the question of whether the FBI's findings could get the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview shown last Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig something out that could change their attitude.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
Kennedy said, of course.
“When I went into the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened — after the accusations came forward — and said: “Did you do it?
He was steel-seat, determined and unequivocal.
Graham’s voice, on the other hand, seems to have been chiseled in stone.
“I have decided with regard to Brett Kavanaugh, and other things would require a very violent accusation,” he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know Brett strongly denied it - Graham added a reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I can't see it had to change anything.
What is the Global Citizens Festival, and has it done something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday New York is the host city of the Global Citizens Festival - an annual music festival with a very impressive offer of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end the world's poverty.
For the seventh time, the Global Citizens Festival will receive tens of thousands of people on Central Park’s large lawn, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will draw attention to the real goal, which is to end extreme poverty in 2030.
Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international interest organization that fights to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertors must perform a number of tasks or actions, e.g. do voluntary work, write to a world leader, make a phone call or another meaningful act that can raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizens been, now that they have 12 years to reach the goal?
Creates the idea of rewarding people with a free concert real change, or is it just another case of so-called “clicktivism”, that is, people feel that they make a difference by signing a signature collection online or making a Twitter look?
Global Citizens reports that since 2011, they have registered more than 19 million “actions” from their members aimed at different objectives.
They believe that these actions have encouraged world leaders to set binding objectives and policies, equivalent to more than 37 billion dollars, which in 2030 are expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group listed 390 objectives and actions that had become due to their actions, which ran up to over $10 billion which had already been paid or collected.
The Group estimates that, so far, these funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main goals is The Power of Nutrition, which has started in England and is a collaboration between investors and strong individuals. They strive to help children live their full potential - and promise 35 million dollars to remedy nutritional problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the help of the English government, donors, governments of other countries and world citizens like you, social injustice with malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books,” said the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the UK Government has now promised funds to improve nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 online calls. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with nutrition advice.
In response to one of the website’s frequently asked questions, it says: “What makes you think that we can end extreme poverty —
wrote Global Citizens: “It will be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we will stumble and make mistakes.
But like the civil rights movement and the movement towards apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performers of this year's festival in New York. Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman must be hosts.
The United States can use its fleet to “block” for Russian energy exports, says the U.S. Minister for the Interior
If necessary, Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, to expose the US Home Secretary, Ryan Zinke, to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where they operate on the invitation of the rightful government - is a pretext for extending the sale of their energy.
I believe that they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe, he must have said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
“The U.S. has the opportunity with our fleet to ensure that there is free passage on the maritime roads, and if necessary we can also block them, so that we ensure that their energy does not come to the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting held by Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organisation that regards itself as the voice of the American energy consumer.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran and said that they are basically the same.
“The economic potential of Iran and Russia is about using and replacing fuel,” he said, while referring to Russia as a “one-trick pony” whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These opinions come after the Trump administration has aimed at increasing European exports of liquid natural gas, which will replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
To achieve this, proponents of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the inappropriate North Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump has made Berlin Moscow's prisoner.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion expensive Nord Stream 2 line, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of unfair conditions of competition and is merely a result of economic considerations.
“I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose a supplier,” said Russian Minister for Energy, Alexandr Novak, at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with the American Minister for Energy, Rick Perry, in September.
The American position is met by criticism from Germany, which confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem with a third party getting involved in our energy supplies,” said the leader of BDI, Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between the German chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is thinking strongly about running for presidents in 2020, says the senator from Massachusetts
Senator of Massachusetts's Elizabeth Warren, who thinks strongly about running for the presidential election after the mid-term elections, said Saturday.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering setting up.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it takes a woman in front,” says The Hill.
After 6 November, I'm going to be thinking strongly about running for the presidential election.
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump, under the city council, and said that he's leading the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing about our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been pronounced in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
On a tweet Friday, Warren wrote: “Of course the FBI has to investigate the matter before the vote...
However, a Thursday poll shows that most of Warren's own backland does not believe that she should set up in 2020.
According to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of the \"probable\" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not set up.
32% supported the potential candidate.
The survey showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick by 38% for and 48% against a possible position.
Other highly-profiled democratic candidates, discussed in the context of the Presidential elections in 2020, include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden states that he will announce his final decision in January, writes Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palins PTSD at a meeting for Donald Trump
26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after reporting to the army in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, after he has come home, enables me to relate to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers are returning home with,” she told the audience to a Trump voters meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the elephant in space, and said about his son and other war veterans that they have changed and become harder. They go and think whether there is respect for what their colleagues on land and in the air and all the other members of the military have done for the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence against a woman to prevent the notification of domestic violence and possession of a drunk weapon,\" says Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the Wasillas police.
18 States and D.C. support opposition to new asylum laws
18 States and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new American law refusing asylum for victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 States and the D.C. delivered on Friday in Washington a partial declaration in support of an asylum seeker who opposes the law, says NBC News.
The applicant's full name in the trial Grace vs. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union submitted in August against the federal law, has not been published.
She says that her partner and his violent sons, who are gang members, had abused her, but American officials refused her asylum application on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors, who support Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of American asylum seekers tribes, countries with far-reaching problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum legislation overturned a decision by the U.S. Foreigner Board in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants who fled from domestic violence to seek asylum.
The district of Columbia’s Attorney General, Karl Racine, stated on Friday that the new law is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law.
“Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be determined on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle goes against that principle,” says the Party-independent declaration.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law of refusal of immigrants would harm the American economy, since it is more likely that they would become self-employed and supply the necessary labour,
In June, Minister of Justice Jeff Sessions removed the right of immigration judges to give asylum to victims who flee from domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asyl is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or a political stand,” said Sessions in his announcement of the law of 11 June.
Asylum has never been meant to solve all the problems - or just all the serious problems - that people worldwide face every day.
While the death rate doubles, attempts to find survivors in Palu are desperate
For survivors, the situation only got worse.
“It’s very tense,” said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her little fevered boy at an evacuation center in Palu’s broken town.
Every minute, the ambulance comes in with bodies.
We need clean water.
The inhabitants now returned to their broken homes to sort in soaked possessions and save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, also hit by the 7.5 earthquake, could not keep up.
Some of the injuries, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, lay outside Palus military hospital, where patients are treated outdoors due to severe aftershock.
He had tears in his eyes when he told how the violent earthquake shook that hotel room on the fifth floor, he shared with his wife and daughter.
There wasn't time to save ourselves.
I was mast up against a broken wall, I think - said Haris to Associated Press and added that his family was going to wedding in town.
“ I heard my wife scream for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe.
American ambassador accuses China of subtle practices and propaganda ads
One week after a Chinese newspaper, a four-page ad in an American daily newspaper that hit a drum for the benefits of American-Chinese cooperation, accuses the American ambassador of China Beijing to use the American press to spread propaganda.
The U.S. president, Donald Trump, referred Wednesday to China Daily’s paid admission to Des Moine’s Register — Iowa’s best selling newspaper — after accusing China of meddling in the 6th of November Congress elections. China rejects the accusation.
American officials say to Reuters that Trump's accusation of Chinese interference in the American elections marks a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in an escalating trade war, where they have in several ways imposed customs duties on each other's imports.
China’s duty on retaliation in the trade war should be imposed on exporters in States such as Iowa, which supported the Republican party of Trump, considers Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador of China former governor of Iowa, who is a large exporter of agricultural food to China, said that Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a leader of Sunday's Des Moines Register that China is stepping up the use of the subtle methods of running propaganda ads in our own free press.
“By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government uses the proud American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by running a paid ad in Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
“On the other hand, in the Kioskers here in Beijing, you will find only disputing votes. And you will not get a fair picture of the different attitudes of the Chinese people towards China’s worrying economic direction, as the media are under strict control from the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish — his article, even though he didn't say which.
Republicans alienate women before the mid-term election with the Kavanaugh case, warning analysts
While many top republicans support and defend the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh against accusations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that they will experience a counter-reaction in the forthcoming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The case has put the emotions in check, and most Republicans have already announced that like to see the voting process continue.
“This can’t be done about,” said Grant Reher, professor of Political Science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article on Saturday.
Reher said he doubted that the Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona)'s request for an FBI investigation in 11 hours will soften the anger of voters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday — they don’t forget it tomorrow or November” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman of the progressive group MoveOn, according to The Hill this Friday.
On Friday morning, the protesters cried out during a demonstration in the Senate: “November comes, when the Republicans, who control the judicial committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, says Mic.
“The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach a new height,” said independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg to the news medium.
People say it's already reached a high level; that's right.
But it can reach even higher, especially among women swingers in the suburbs and younger voters - 18-29-year-olds - who rarely vote, despite not liking the president,
Even before Ford’s public accusations of the Supreme Court’s sexual abuse, analysts had pointed out that if the Republicans continued to make the nomination, it could be a setback.
“It has become a worse mess for the Republicans,” said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republic National Committee, at the beginning of last week according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final result, or whether Kavanaugh is held accountable; it’s also about how the Republicans have handled it here and how they have dealt with her,” points Guy Cecil, chairman of the Priorities of the United States, a group that supports Democrats in being elected, to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to have shared opinions on who to believe after the testimonys from Ford and Kavanaugh, where the latter has a little more on their side.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 % of the respondents believed in Ford's testimony, or probably believed in Ford's explanation, while 35 % said they believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that they thought that Kavanaugh either probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following a call from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the accusations presented by Ford and at least another, writes Deborah Ramirez for The Guardian.
Ford announced last week under oath to the Senate Legal Committee that Kavanaugh, in full, attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals at a party when they both studied at Yale in the 80s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to create a new internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, launches a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Technology Doctor's latest project is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the plan with Inrupt is world domination.
“We have to do it now,” he said about the start-up business.
It's a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology so people can make their own personal online data collection or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, two-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data collection is that it is completely up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data”
The Inrupt idea is, according to the company's managing director John Bruce, to gather resources, processes and abilities to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contracts and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology developers worldwide can make their own decentralised apps by using the available tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team are not talking to \"Facebook or Google about whether to change everything completely, so all of their business models suddenly become redundant\"
We're not asking for their permission.
Berners-Lee wrote in a paper on the Media Saturday that the Inrupts-mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new internet built on Solid
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the next period of the Internet,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Guest recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War I is hailed
The only minister of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross by fighting during the First World War will be celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Wann won the order on September 29th, 1918, during the attack by Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and never got to know that he had won the highest English military order.
Last Saturday a memorial was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said it was “unbelievably symbolic” that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s orderly achievement.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann on September 29, 1918, led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin, through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from machine guns and artillery.
He later ran to the front line and led with the “greatest courage of man — his people before he alone attacked an artillery and unharmed three cannons.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann at 72 said his grandfather's actions were something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble.
He and his brother James Vann also put a wreath after the parade, as stated by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he “felt very honored to participate in the parade and added that the support of all these people emphasizes the true heroic attitude.
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but instead got Gurli Gris.
Imagine you've been up all night to see the starry Bellator 206 and then being refused to see the main event.
There were 13 games on the program from San Jose, including six games on the main program, and they were shown overnight in England at Channel 5.
At 6 in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to meet each other, the viewers in England were somewhat surprised when the transmission changed to show Gurli Gris.
Some were uninvited after they had stayed awake early in the morning for this particular fight.
A fan on Twitter described the shift to a children's cartoon movie like a kind of sick joke.
“The legislation did not provide for this content at 6 o’clock in the morning, why they had to switch to children’s programmes,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior department president when asked about the broadcast.
\"Grisen Gurli,\" yes.
Bellator's CEO, Scott Coker, said they would work to include English viewers in future planning.
“When it comes to the resend, I think we can make it work,” said Coker.
“But it’s six Sunday mornings over there, and we’re not going to find a solution to it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the change was made, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was actually the law.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We just had five games instead of six, as we normally do, and we tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had “minority” over sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he felt less valuable than everyone else in his upbringing because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said it didn't happen to him until he came into the major classes, that \"all are not like me,\"
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about homosexual rights to give others hope-
He also said that he went less up to winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The usual host on the radio program, which has been running long, Kirsty Young, has taken off for a few months because of illness.
Daley was a guest in Laverne's first program and said that he felt “less worth — than everyone else in his childhood because “it was not socially accepted to like boys and girls”
He said: “To this day, the feelings of feeling worth and feeling different have been the things that have given me the strength to succeed,
He wanted to prove that he was something, he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they learned his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze winner has become a high-profile LGBT champion and used his participation in this year's Common Games in Australia to appeal for a decrimination of homosexuality in several countries.
He said that he spoke out because he felt lucky to live openly without negative consequences and he would give others hope-
The triple world champion said that he had been “surpassed” when he fell in love with a man — the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who was 20 years older than him, but told me that the age difference had never been a problem.
He told me that it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs when going through so much at such a young age - he went to his first Olympic at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June, the couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Dayy, and Daley said that his whole perspective had changed.
If you had asked me last year, it would be all about winning a gold medal, he said.
But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley told me that his father did not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had got tickets to London in 2012 when he would sit in the front row.
I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there at that time.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and it first dawned on me that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead, he said.
The following year Daley participated in the Olympics in 2012 and won bronze.
“I just knew that it was what I had dreamed about my whole life — to dive in front of a home audience at the Olympics. Nothing could beat that feeling,” he said.
It was also the inspiration of his first song choice — Proud of Heather Small — which had meant a lot during the lookout to the Olympics and still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Uskarp Mickelson on the bench for Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday when he plays his 47. game in Ryder Cup, but he has to do something about the shape if it isn't to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who sets the record for the 12th time in the competition, which is held every 2 years, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk because of Saturday's four-balls and four-somes.
Instead of being at the center of events for the United States as usual, the five-time big winner had to act like cheerleaders and practice his game in the hope of straightening up the whips.
Even at the peak of his career he had the most direct drive, why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match for the course at Le Golf National, where the long rough often punishes lost shots.
And if the track was not big enough mouthful, Mickelson will at the ninth game on Sunday meet the always precise winner of British Open Francesco Molinari, who has joined the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who start the 12 single battles, start heavily, Mickelson's battle can be decisive.
Furyk did not express surprising confidence in his teammate.
“He understood his role completely today, gave me a pin on his back, put his arm around me, and said that he would be ready tomorrow,” said Furyk.
He has a great faith in himself.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams before - and also this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought he'd play more, but that's how it went, and that's how it should be.
He wants to be out there like everybody else.
On Sunday, Mickelson Nick Faldo beats the record for the most played matches in Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never been able to completely match his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven undecided, although Furyk said that his presence contributes with something undefinable.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he likes to run to people, and he’s good to have in the team room,” he explained.
“I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes with much more than just the game --
Europe's Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great conduct can quickly disappear
The European Captain Thomas Bear knows from experience that a solid performance before the last day of Ryder Cup's single showdown can quickly become nervous.
The Dane debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a head start of five points over the Americans, but was just about to be caught before the finish with a victory of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice run in Valderrama, we had a nice run in Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we only won exactly,” says Bjørn after watching the 2018 team win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday for a total run of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
It's going to have a full trash tomorrow.
Go outside and do everything right.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal and it's trying to win the trophy, and that's where our focus is.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we also know what is on the other side - the best golfers in the world -
Rejoicing at his players ’ performance on a hard track, Bjorn added: “I don’t take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow's a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow, it's the individual performances that count, and that's something else entirely.
It's great to be out there with a partner when you're doing well, but when you're out there alone, you're being tested on all the parameters as a golfer.
That's what the players need to understand - bring out the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now you're gonna leave your partner, because he's gonna get the best out of himself, too.
It also looks like the opponent Jim Furyk, who hopes for better individual performances than in the partner game with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been in conflict on the last day. First at the winning team in Brookline before he lost when Europe was doing \"Miraklet at Medinah\"
“I remember every word,” he said, when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had spoken to his players in 1999 before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want a good start, as you saw at Brookline, as you saw on Medinah.
When the moment has found a direction, it puts great pressure on the middle combat.
We put our teams together in relation to it and put the players on the field in the order we feel. We try to create magic tomorrow.
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the retreat and facing Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans are playing in the first half of the order.
“I chose this group of players in this order because I think it ensures us all the way through,” Bjørn said about his choice of single players.
Germany’s new warship is being postponed again
The German fleet’s latest frigate should have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War. However, the Germans must wait at least one year yet due to technical problems and an escalating price, writes local media.
The deployment of the largest ship into the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of Frigatter, “Rheinland-Palatinate” has been postponed until the first half of 2019 according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have become part of the fleet in 2014, but post-delivery problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four boats from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, are to replace the aging frigates of the Bremen class.
About them you know that they want a powerful cannon, a large selection of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the latest freaks is a minor need for maintenance: it should be possible to have the frigates away from the home ports for up to two years.
However, the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships - which are said to make Germany appear as an overseas power factor - will already be obsolete when they are inaugurated, writes Die Zeit.
The failed F125 fregat created headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to use the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Not much was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of crucial “software and hardware errors” that made the warship useless in combat situations.
Software errors were of particular importance when ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class must be managed by a crew of 120 sailors - that is only half of the crew from the older Bremen family.
It also turned out that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the fleet's potential for future updates.
The 7000 tonnes of heavy-duty “Rheinland-Palatinate” are said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the price of the project, which includes training the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a huge €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), with an initial price of €2.2 billion.
The problems of the latest frgats are becoming even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's fleet is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the German Government's Defence Committee, earlier this year admitted that the fleet is running out of eligible ships.
The official said the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of service without being replaced.
He complained that none of the frigates from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust Sniper to the Secret Life of the bats
New research from an area in the highlands of Scotland is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape when they hunt.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and will help in the work on future conservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scientists from Scotland's National Trust and follows ordinary bats, dwarf bats, long-dryed bats and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment shall be placed in carefully selected locations in the area to record the activities of the bats during the season.
Data are also collected from NTS personnel and volunteers using handheld detectors.
In-depth analysis of the sound recordings will reveal the frequency of bat calls and show which species does what.
To produce a detailed landscape picture of their behavior, a report is made and a map of the habitat.
Natural conservation adviser for NTS Rob Dewar hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help to determine the benefits of habitat conservation such as the establishment of meadows and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen dramatically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect shipowners and restrict their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger.
In fact, bats are not blind.
But because they primarily hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an advanced echolocation technology to locate insects and to fly around obstacles.
NTS, responsible for the conservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts, who often collect data, inspect nests and sometimes make rescue operations.
The organization has even made Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve in the region of Threeaves in Dumfris and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten of Scotland's bat species.
The district manager, David Thompson, says it is an ideal territory for them.
“Here at Three we have a really good area for bats,” he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees, and all the good habitats.
There's a lot that you don't know about bats, so work here and elsewhere can help to understand what they need to thrive on.
He emphasises the importance of looking for bats before performing maintenance tasks on buildings, as the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and young people. Thus, it is possible to destroy an entire local population.
The bat is at peace and it is illegal to kill, bother or disturb them or their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Project Leader for the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to give a hand with.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we have, we don’t know how the populations develop.
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers sue German journals
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape charges against him for fake news and says that people will promote themselves by using his name.
His lawyers are getting ready to sue the German news medium Der Spiegel, who brought the accusations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he paid her $375,000 to keep it secret, wrote Der Spiegel last Friday.
Some hours after the allegations had been published, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticised the information for being “fake news”
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news, said the five-time winner of Ballon d'Or to the camera.
They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and everything's good - added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel because of the charges they have called, according to Reuters, an unforgivable publication of suspicions about privacy.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player would seek compensation for “moral corruption in a class similar to the accusation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”
The event took place in June 2009 in a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting each other at a nightclub Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player’s room where he would have raped her anally according to the report submitted in City Court in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was... a good guy 99% of the time... gripped by the one percent...
The file claims that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that there was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed in a hospital, but that later she agreed to an agreement outside the court, because she felt that she was “slow about retaliation and worried about being “publicly spoiled”
The 34-year-old now says that she will reverse the agreement, as she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo faced a shift from Manchester United to Real Madrid, when the event should have taken place, and changed in summer to the Italian big club Juventus for 100 million €.
Brexit: Great Britain will always regret losing car manufacturers
Great Britain — will regret it forever — if it lost its position as leading car manufacturer worldwide after Brexit, said Business Minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was \"disquieting\" that Topotecan UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily lower production at the company in Burnaston near Derby.
Clark said we need a deal.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting at the border in case of a Brexit without a contract could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces the auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, where 90% of them were exported to the rest of the EU.
“As I see it, production will stop at our factory if Britain goes out of the EU at the end of March,” said the CEO at Burnaston, Marvin Cooke.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, express fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says they will close their Mini factory in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is about the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of an exit without an agreement.
Topotecan's production runs on a tight schedule where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be problems at the border which, according to the automotive industry, could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for the scheme to store more than a day's production at the Derbyshire factory, and then production would be stopped, the company said.
Clark says that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future negotiations with the EU is \"composite, so that these border checks are avoided\".
We need an agreement. We want the best deal that not only allows us - as I call it - to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity - he told the BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“The opinions of the European Commission and other manufacturers indicate that we need to be able to continue what has been successful in the supply chain”
Tooyata could not say how long production would have stopped, but in the longer term, higher prices would reduce the competitiveness of the factory, which will ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a joint trust worker at the factory, says that his members are becoming more and more concerned: “My experience tells me that as these jobs disappear, they will not be again”
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump’s important meeting with the Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein can “be postponed one week more — when the settlement around the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continues,” said the White House this Sunday.
Rosenstein looks at the special prosecutor Robert Mueller over his shoulder during his investigation of Russian electoral interference, connections between Trump's helpers and Russia and the president's possible obstacle to the trial.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Minister of Justice and thus risk Mueller's independence has been a gossip in Washington for months.
The New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein was considering wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president via the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and the rumor was that he was going to quit.
Instead, a meeting was arranged on Thursday with Trump, who at that time was at the UN headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would rather not fire Rosenstein. But the meeting was delayed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate hearing where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who have accused him of sexual abuse, had to testify.
Last Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate's election.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was at Fox News on Sunday.
When asked to meet Rosenstein, she said: “No date has been set; it could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed a week with everything that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we have to see, and I always like to keep the press up to date.
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press meetings was not due to TV reporters playing for the gallery, but added: “I don’t disagree with them playing up to the camera —
She then said that the direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
“ The president receives more questions from the press than any president before him, ” she said, adding without quoting a source: “We’ve looked at the figures,
Press meetings will still take place, said Sanders, but “If the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We're trying to give a lot of opportunity for this, and you've seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it's going to be in the press conference place when you can talk to the President of the United States.
Trump often receives questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open hearings or press meetings with high-ranking guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York City, the president showed why, when making an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the present journalists.
Minister of Health contacts EU staff in the Scottish healthcare system after Brexit concerns
The Minister for Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and desire that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than half a year before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to paying for applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit have continued, and it seems that decisions will be expected in the autumn.
However, the British Government has also increased their preparation for a possibly Brexit without an agreement.
I know this must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from and outside the EU come with valuable experiences and competences that strengthen and improve health care work for the benefit of patients and the local community.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we would very much like you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie has acute surgery after head injury
The lineback from Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie was acutely operated after having suffered a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, it is reported by Tennessee's Mike Organ.
First coach for Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the incident occurred before the break.
“He went to the sideline and just fell over out there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they put him on a stretcher and took him in for further examination.
A spokesman from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are no details of the type or extent of the injury yet - and Tennessee State is trying to find out when he was inflicting the injury.
Abercrombie is studying in second year and is in the process of her first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five tackles last Saturday before he left the game, which gives him 18 tackles gathered this season.
Foreign buyers charge higher stamp tax when buying houses in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp charges when buying property in the UK.
This move must dampen Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp tax will affect those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects 120 million dollars a year for the homeless.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp tax when buying properties in the UK for the benefit of the homeless.
Tired will be considered an attempt to respond to Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper homes and to go after them with the highest income.
The increase in the stamp tax will affect people and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK. The income from this must be used for the government’s struggle to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The additional fee, which is added to the current stamp tax and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-home purchases and purchases to rent, can reach 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to collect £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new constructions in London are purchased by people living abroad, which makes prices rise and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital city, have become ghost cities, due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new legislative proposal only comes weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in the stamp tax to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping the real estate prices by buying reasons they don't use. He asked May to drop the quotas on cheap housing in order to solve Britain's embarrassing housing situation.
Corbyn has proposed a striking series of house reforms, including the control of rent prices and the reduction of the landlord's ability to put people on the streets if they comply with the contract.
He will also strengthen the possibility of building public housing.
May said: “Last year I said that I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life would be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be true that it is just as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy housing as for hardworking British people.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the valuelessness of sleeping on the street is still too widespread.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to become Scotland’s coach.
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his \"ultimate goal\" is to become Scotland's coach at some point.
The Battle of 42 enjoys the challenge of revitalizing the North East Club, which now has third place in League One, three points from the top.
He changed to the Stadium of Light this summer after looking back St Mirren in the Scottish Premiery last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
“I played a game with the B team, and that’s it,” said Ross BBC Scotland’s Sports Sound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland on Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it has always pulled me.
However, that opportunity would only arise if I were successful in training clubs -
Ross' predecessors who train for Sunderland are Dick Advocates, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach for Alloa Athletic says that he had no concerns about following so established names in such a large club and had previously refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
Now I'm measuring successfully whether 'I can get this club back in the Premier League.'
From the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League, he said.
“It’s not an easy task, but I’ll probably only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there —
Ross is only three years into his career who train after a period as an assistant trainer at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart's training team.
Then he helped Alloa get back after being moved down in the third best row and transformed St Mirren from the diving threat to title winners the following season.
And Ross says that he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a player for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real road to divorce — he remembers about the time in Alloa.
“I honestly thought that coaching was the right thing for me, more right than being a player.
It sounds strange because I did well, made sense and had some success experiences.
But gambling can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to go through on a weekly basis.
There's still the kind of stress and pressure that train, but it just feels right.
I've always wanted to train, and now I'm doing it. I haven't been more comfortable with myself in my entire adult life.

The best time for a beer is Saturdays at 5:30 p.m., showing survey
The heat wave this summer has increased the earnings of England's pubs, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
Sales on pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while sales in restaurants have gone 4.8% down, showing figures.
Peter Martin, who is a business consultant at CGA and has collected the figures, said: “Continued sunshine and England’s unexpected long World Cup have resulted in July following June’s pattern, where the pubs experienced more sales at 2.8%, except that restaurants are harder hit now.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on the sale of beverages managed the best and experienced progress similar to the decline of restaurants.
Pubs with focus on food were in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
Looks like people just want something to drink.
Between pubs and bar chains, sales of beverages increased by 6.6% per month, while food decreased by 3.3%.
Paul Newman, who analyses the service industry, said: “The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to selling on the out-of-home market, weather and major social or sports events are the main factors.
It is no surprise that restaurants are still fighting, although a drop in sales of 4.8% year after year will do very bad at increasing costs.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide a hard needed breathing room -
The total increase in sales total for pubs and restaurants including new openings was 2,7 % in July, which shows the decrease in newly started fires.
Coffer Peach Tracker, who monitors sales figures for the English pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes data from 47 different groups. Their annual turnover is more than £9 billion and they are leading in the area.
Every five children have a secret account on social media that they hide from their parents
Every five children, down to 11 years of age, have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers, study.
A study of 20,000 school students in the 4-9th grade reveals growth in false Insta pages.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content being added
20% of the students said they have a master account that they can show their parents
Every five children down to the age of 11 set up accounts on the social media they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 students from the fourth grade reveals strong growth in false Insta accounts, a reference to the Image Sharing Service Instagram.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content is being laid.
20% of the students said they have a master account, which they can show their parents while they also have private ones.
A mother who fell over her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a teenager who called on others to rape me.
The survey carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistress' Conference (HMC) for private schools found that 40 % of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to holding private accounts.
The leader of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “It’s scary that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where their parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the athletes on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected Board of Scottish Athletics at the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most winning athlete, and President Ian Bettie described the change as a good opportunity for those who decide on sport to benefit from her great 10-year experience at international level.
“Eilidh enjoys great reputation in the athletic world of Scotland, Britain and the rest of the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit from getting her on board,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I will try to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope that I can contribute and help find a direction for sport in Scotland,

Advertisers for breast pump comparing mothers to cows get mixed online reception
A breast pump company has shared opinions online with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers to cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be the world's first silent breast pump, the technological consumer magazine has published a sarcastic music video-inspired advertising to show the freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a diet, filled with hay, to a song in which it reads: “Yes, I milk myself, but you don’t see any tail — and if you hadn’t noticed, this isn’t Yvere, these are my breasts.
The district says: “Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my child, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my bosom...
But the advertising, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has brought controversy online.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received a mixed reception from the viewers. Many say it makes fun of the horrors of the milk industry.
“Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and fed before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth, wrote a user.
Elvie’s breast pump is discreetly matched in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another wrote: “I understand that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump to mothers who are allowed to keep their children?
Another added: “What an insensitive advertisement?
Others defended the ad. A woman admitted that she thought the song was incredibly funny.
I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd have one.
Lactation made me feel exactly like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a brilliant product - wrote you.
Another commented: “It’s a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who pump milk (often at their workplace or in toilets) and feel like ‘cools’.
It is not an advertising that praises or criticizes the milk industry.
At the end of the video the women reveal that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the advertising is based on the fact that many women who breast-feed say they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely silent, has no pipes or snakes and fits discreetly in a suckling bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their children and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, a partner and director of Mother, wrote: “Pump from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between breast-feeding mothers and dairy cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping, while showing in an entertaining and recognizable way the freedom the new pump can give -
It's not the first time the Elvie pump created headlines.
In London Fashion Week a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrants secretly moved to a tent camp at the border of Texas
The number of captive migrants' children has exploded, although the number of bordergoers has not changed. This is partly due to a harder rhetoric and the Trump administration's tighter laws that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared their ability to stay in the country by coming forward and taking a child.
The return risk increased in June when the authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household would provide fingerprints and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Force, witnessed to Congress and told them that they had arrested several persons who sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had a clean criminal record.
“Close 80 % of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors’ households stay illegally in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
So we're still chasing those people, Albence said.
In attempting to deal with children's cases faster, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to meet in court within a month of their detention.
Many use video calls instead of themselves meeting up and speaking their case for legal residence to an immigration judge.
Those who are sentenced to ineligible residence shall be deported quickly.
The longer children stay in custody, the more likely they are to have anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outcomes or escape attempts, says relief workers and reports from the system in recent months.
People who are advamping for better conditions say that these risks are more pronounced in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where the size makes it harder to keep an eye on whether a child is suffering.
They added that moving to a tent village without mental preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to friends can build up traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria informs US, French and Turkish occupation forces that they must withdraw immediately
When the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid al-Mualem, spoke to the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces’ stay in the country is illegal and under the pretext of fighting terrorism and they will “be met with similar means”
“They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions,” he said to the House.
Moualem insisted that the war against terrorism “almost is over — in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this decisive war until we have purged all Syrian areas — for both terrorist groups and “illegal foreign presence” —
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria who primarily train and advise Kurdish and Syrian-Arab forces who are against President Bashar al-Issad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war - torn country.
In the area of refugees, Moualem said that conditions were good enough for them to return home, after which he accused “some Western countries — to spread unjustified fear — that caused the refugees to disappear.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help facilitate these return missions,” he said.
They're policing what's supposed to be a purely humanitarian matter.
The United States and the EU have warned that no help will be given to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel controlled city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
Because of the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack by Syrian forces, supported by Russia, was avoided against the province, where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had \"clear deadlines\" and expressed the hope that military action would go after jihadists from the Nusra front, a starting-point group of Al-Qaeda who would be \"exterminated\"
The UN's envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call soon for the first meetings of the new committee to outline a postwar constitution for Syria and pave the way for a elections.
Moualem has set the conditions for the Syrian Government to participate in the committee and states that the work of the panel must be limited to “to review the legislation of the current Constitution” and warned against interference.
That's why Trump wins another presidential term.
Based on that logic, Trump is probably re-elected in 2020, unless the case of the State and the scandals ends his term of office in advance, which many liberal viewers are hoping for.
In what will undoubtedly be “The most dramatic conclusion to a presidential period ever”
Currently, there is no sign of seeing fatigue.
Since 2014, the ratings of the best broadcast time have almost doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best time to compare with 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. The MSNBCs The Rachel Maddow Show has most viewers with up to 3.5 million on evenings of great news.
“It’s a spectacular that attracts people because it’s not something we understand,” said Neal Baer, who leads the ABC-Drama Designed Survivor about a leader of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress Building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of the “Just the Funny Parts: And a Fear Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club” has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi in Boston before the elections in 2016.
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
- Why, she asked.
He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,' Scovell said.
The box has an entertainment value.
However, unlike any other television program, the stories coming from Washington can determine the case between Roe and Wade whether refugee families can be reunited and the health of the world economy.
Changing the channel is only the most privileged.
And yet it's about more than being enlightened citizens when you see six hours of panel debate, where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of \"deep background\" when he wrote his book \"Fear\"; Paul Manafort's ostrich leather jacket for $15,000 - covered with hubris - wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' living descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
I don't want to see Super Mario the same way.
“Some of the things that make it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, Managing Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of the “Pawn Stars” about the rotating crew and daily surprises of the Trump show (smanships with N.F.L., praise to Kim Jong-un.)
But if you miss a episode, you're off.
When I got hold of Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and saw MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was to be heard in the Senate judicial committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was to be determined.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, ‘It’s the beginning of the end of Western civilization’, Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

Large sums find their way to the close midway elections to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th district receives large sums of money. As a result of a compensatory two-Congressional Districts, two Congressmen are fighting for the same seat.
This newly relocated suburb of Pittsburgh creates problems for the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb opposes another member of Congress, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania’s 12th district, which strongly overlaps with the new 17.
The cards were revised after the January Supreme Court of Pennsylvania convicted that the old territory was unlawfully set up in favor of the Republicans.
The struggle for the new 17th district has begun a struggle for financial resources between the large party committees, the Democratic Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republic Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a highly vigilant choice in March' special elections for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seat has been on the Republican hands for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for aid to China but changed its mind
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already acknowledged Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners kicked Trump's leadership team out.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to recall leading U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after “the recent decision not to recognise Taiwan anymore,” said Heather Nauert, spokeswoman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in an announcement earlier this month.
But only El Salvador was punished, and they received approximately $ 140 million from the United States in 2017 for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which include cutting financial aid and restrictions on admission permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials suspended a summit on security and economic development, which should have continued last year's meeting, which was considered a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
However, in mid-September, the top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway, and thus dropped the considerations of punishment to El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has to address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to send a signal on the importance of the American meeting, said diplomats.
And the three U.S. agents secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh demands or punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson for Bolton from the White House did not wish to comment on the details of the case, which were described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who would like to discuss internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the basis of a condition of anonymity.
Know History
The next obstacle might well be the special prosecutor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to the investigation, for which there is considerable and publicly available evidence.
It is said that Mueller will also direct his investigation into the question of whether Trump's campaign secretly cooperated with Russia on the attack on the elections.
If Congress should come into new hands, Trump will probably be held accountable while he prepares to meet the voters again and, in time, of course, a jury of his companions.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not claim that Trump's finality is inevitable - and the same applies to his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must all make choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
In 1938 German officers were ready to put in a coup against Hitler if only the West could have resisted him by supporting the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and did not take the opportunity to avoid the long bloodbath thereafter.
It is about such turning points that the axis of history is turning around and the unalterable march of democracy is slowing down.
In the United States, there are now several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fire the man who decides the future of Mueller's investigation, Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been warm since this newspaper could announce that he had proposed last year to make hidden recordings of the president and challenged his suitability for office.
Rosenstein says The Times' production is inexplicable.
How do we react if F.B.I.'s recent investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is suspended or not properly carried out or approved to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, more importantly, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will hold Trump responsible?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the very Nazi regime which once occupied my embassy's homeland.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me 60 years later to light Sabbath lights on the table with the swastika.
How can I be anything but optimistic about that in my luggage?

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic ahead of the fight against SK Rapid Wien
Rangers take on Thursday against SK Rapid Wien. After the impressive undecided result in Spain against Villarreal earlier in the month they will have good opportunities to move forward from Group G of the Europe League with a victory against the Austrians.
A knee injury prevented midway player Graham Dorrans from getting the season debut before the 2-2 fight against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a jumpboard for something even bigger.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went to the game with the belief that we could bring something home, and we got a point.
Maybe we could have taken the sting home, but everything was probably a fair result.
I think they were the best in the first half, but we got out in the second half and were the best team.
On Thursday, another great European night will be.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they got a good result in the last game. But with the audience behind us, I am sure that we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
Last year has been hard because of everything that's happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully, we can go on now, put the last season behind us and make a success of it.
Anxious over pension savings makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared for, only a few talked about it to the family.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study reported that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent told them they talked to their children about it.
“Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t do anything to start the conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
That's how you get it going.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not tell them in good time about your wishes.
Use your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices can be crucial factors for costs.
Ask your financial adviser: Your advisor can also help you find out how to pay for your expenses.
Long-term care can, among other things, be financed through a traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payment or self-insurance with your own funds, as long as you have the economy for it.
Get the legal documents fixed: Take the legal struggles in the run-up.
Get a mandate prepared so that you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure that doctors and medical staff comply with your wishes, in case you cannot communicate yourself.
Consider also an economic authority.
In this case, you will appoint a trusted person who can make financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you are not able to do so yourself.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that one of your aging parents needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Get all these details down on paper, so you're ready.
It's not just a question of the economy, who are the doctors, asked Martin.
What medication?
Who's looking after the dog?
Get the plan in place.
Man shot several times with air rifles in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a trip into town.
The victim was in the 40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, diaphragm and hand.
Officers describe the shooting that took place around 02.30 a.m.
The victim didn't see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police call on witnesses to appear.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and a tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Since communications routes are out of play, emergency workers have not been able to receive information from the government Dongala, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake struck.
Here are some facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesian province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379.800.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami struck.
Dongala is a rule that extends over 300 km of coastline on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, which is an administrative region under a province, had in 2017 an estimated population of 299.200.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the Central Sulawesian economy, especially in the Dongala coastal area.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province but takes place mainly in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala, according to Indonesia’s disaster center, have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
In 1996, Dongala was again hit by a tsunami that killed nine.
Indonesia is seismological on the so-called firefight in the Pacific and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the greatest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: On December 26, a violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, including more than half of these in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and not until April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake, which measured 6.8, hit south of Java, Indonesia’s most densely populated island, and triggered a tsunami, which crashed on the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 hit near the city of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake, which measured 7.5, hit one of the Mentawai islands from Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 metres, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake struck the Pie Jaya regiment in Aceh and spread destruction and panic when the population was reminded of the 2004 deadly earthquakes and tsunami.
Not a tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapseing buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists the beach.
Sarah Palin’s oldest son charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice president Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska was arrested after suspicion of domestic violence, preventing the notification of domestic violence and to oppose arrest, according to the report that Saturday was issued by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is in custody of Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a 500-dollar bail without security, reports KTUU.
He was put before the court on Saturday, when he declared himself “not clearly guilty” reporting the network.
Palin is charged for three Class A offences that can lead to a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B infringement that can lead to a punishment of one single day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with crimes.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the assault.
The case is currently pending at Alaskan Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, to have prevented the notification of a violent crime in the home as well as the possession of weapons in the affected state in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of beating her face.
Sarah Palin was criticised in 2016 by veteran groups after explaining his son's violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his posting in Iraq.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia: several hundred dead
At least 384 people have died, after an earthquake on Friday the Indonesian island of Sulawesi struck.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and communication routes and the number of dead is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just south of central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On the social media, videos are circulating that show the moment when the earthquake strikes.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach party in the town of Palu, when the tsunami broke down on the coast.
Public prosecutors are trying to get a terrorist suspect in NYC rarely sentenced to the death penalty
Public prosecutors are attempting to impose the death penalty on Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight persons — a rare punishment that was last convicted of a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov reportedly used a rental car from the Home Depot construction market to execute an attack on a bike path along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who got in the way were caught up.
As a basis for the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov \"intendedly\" killed the eight victims and \"intendedly\" caused serious personal injury, which is required by the declaration of intent of the death penalty in the southern district of New York.
According to the legal document, the death penalty is a possible result of both of these cases.
Several weeks after the attack, a government jury was able to present Saipov for an prosecution of 22 points, including eight charges of gangbangers, typically used by public prosecutors in organised crime cases, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for “extensive planning and preparation”, said the prosecutors, describing Saipov’s execution as “unspeakable, evil and depraved.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, bodily injury and loss for families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” says the intention statement.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since New York's southern district last raised the defendant in a case of the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but ended up getting life-long prison sentences in September 2009.
The death penalty was recently imposed in a state case in New York in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov came from Uzbekistan and, according to the legal documents, showed no evidence of repentance in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was doing well with his work.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, told the cops.
He has denied the 22 points of the charge.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s public defenders, announced that they “of course were disappointed — by the decision of the prosecutors.
“We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and lifelong imprisonment without the possibility of release will only extend the trauma to all those involved,” said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the charges not to go after the death penalty.
The Conservative Minister believes that NIGEL FARAGE should take over the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the army of the people” during a demonstration at the conservative meeting today.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians could mark the pressure of the Eurosceptics after one of Theresa May's own ministers had said that Farage should take over negotiations with the European Union.
Private Conservative Member Peter Bone said to the Birmingham demonstration that Britain would have been out now if Farage had been a Brexit dealer.
May's challenge of gathering in the deeply divided party is highlighted by the participation of conservative Remains in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan on track during attacks by both Brexites, Remains and the EU.
Her allies insist that, despite the setback, she will continue to seek an agreement with Brussels, thereby forcing the eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or kaos,
To the demonstration Leave Means Leave in Solihull, Bone announced that he would destroy the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given him the responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If he was in charge, we'd be out by now, he said.
The minister from Wellingborough added: “I’ll fight for Brexit, but we’re going to scrap Chequers —
On the basis of his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We did not fight world wars to be subordinates to anyone.
We will decide our own laws in our own country.
Bone refused that the public's position should have changed since the vote in 2016: “That the British people should have changed their minds and want to stay in the European Union is totally wrong”
The Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also attended the demonstration and told the journalists: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular in the broad population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the streets and get us elected.
Now drop Chequers and start listening.'
As a tip to May, she added: “Premier ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises,
Farage told the tape that politicians must be able to mark the pressure if they fail to decide from the vote in 2016.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us — the people — and our political class,” he said.
They want to betray Brexit, but we're all here to tell them that we won't let them get away with it.
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “You need to make sure that the political class that is in the process of betraying Brexit can feel the pressure.
“We’re mobilizing the people’s armies here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we’re not stopping until we’ve become an independent, self-government and proud Britain —
Meanwhile, remainers marched through Birmingham before a two-hour take-off in the city centre.
Spreading activists fanned with Conservative Mod Brexit banners after the formation of the group this weekend.
Before the meeting, Labour colleague Lord Adonis made fun of the security problems of the Conservative Party app.
“They are the people who claim to have control of the IT systems and the technology of Canada for border controls, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland,” he said.
- It's a joke.
There's nothing called a good Brexit, he added.
Warren-thinks strongly - to stand for the presidential election
Member of the Representatives' House, Senator Elizabeth Warren, is strongly considering setting up for the presidential election after the mid-term elections in November.
According to Boston Globe, the Democrats from Massachusetts talked about their future during an council meeting last Saturday in the Western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticised Donald Trump, must in November seek a re-election against State Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired at the Trumps Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
You've been wondering if she'd challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the voters at the town hall since Trump took over the office.
One participant asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and that requires a woman in front of us.
Assault in LSU's Sims shooting case
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on Friday at Wayde Sims, the basketball player from LSU.
The Baton Rouge police announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested on Friday for an ET news meeting at 11.
They had on Friday released a video of the shooting to ask for help to identify a man on the footage.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
“Wayde Sims was hit by shots in the head and died of the injuries — said police chief Murphy J. Paul, according to the 247sports medium.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to have been present, in possession of a weapon and to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any trouble and is now in the custody of the East Baton Rouge District police.
Sims was a two-metre high third year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. Last season he played 32 games, started inside ten and played on average 17.4 minutes and scored 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the World Championship, after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a crucial role for the race.
From the lead position, Bottas got a good start and was close to running Hamilton off as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vetel ran into pit as the first, and let Hamilton fight the traffic at the back of the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes car went into a pit later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back in front when the Ferrari rider after some wheel contact reluctantly had to leave the inner court after a double defense on the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was number seven after his 21st birthday.
Then he led into a large part of the race when, in an attempt at a quick end, he failed to change decks to take the fourth place of the Kimi Raikkonen.
He had to go into pit at 44th, but couldn't increase the pace of the last eight rounds, why the Raikkonen secured the fourth place.
“It’s a tough day because Valteri made it great all weekend and really was a gentleman when he let me come by.
The team did an incredible job to secure both first and second place,” said Hamilton.
Really Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a election meeting last Saturday because she insisted that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At an election meeting in West Virginia, the President did not specifically refer to the testimony that Ford had given in front of the U.S. Senate Legal Committee, but said instead that the events in the Senate showed that people were “bad and disgusting and dishonest”
“The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see that anger when you see people who are angry and malicious and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
\"When you look at the sayings and leaks, they say, \"Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Do you remember that?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember her answer... Was it you who leaked the document?
No, no.
I haven't leaked anything.
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything, he added in a imitation of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter of Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh back in July and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I haven’t hidden Dr. Ford’s accusations, and I haven’t leaked her story,” said Feinstein to the comet, according to The Hill.
She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I have done so.
But her denial was not well received by the president, who, during Saturday’s election meeting, said: “I tell you that was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen.
Under the President's continued defence of the nominated judge to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual abuse by three women, Trump suggested that the Democrats use the accusations to benefit their own cause.
“ They do not shun funds in their efforts to withdraw power.
You can see the wickedness, the repulsiveness, they don't care who they have to tromble to gain power and control,\" said the President, Mediaite said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars did it well again after Friday's Elite League game against Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 in Dundee last Saturday.
Giants came ahead quickly with two targets of attack by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were off-limits before Dwyer brought Giants back.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the third Elite League Nederlag of the season for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Friday's fight in Belfast.
It was the fourth session of the season between the pages where the Giants went out as conquerors in the previous three battles.
Dwyer spent the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assistant from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as his assistant when Beauvilier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy first period Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt stood behind the Cownies compensation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants came ahead at the first break when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The household regrouped, and Bouchard counterbalanced again with a fine goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen lead Dundee ahead for the first time in the battle late in the second period, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four out of their five games, are home in Milton Keynes for their next fight on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died to ensure that hundreds of air passengers avoided earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers safely came down onto the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing, after a major earthquake last Friday hit the Sulawesi Island and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks are still destroying the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung's colleagues fled for life, he refused to leave his place in the swaddle control tower in Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained in his seat to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was held at the starting track, was safely in the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was falling apart.
He died later at the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said, according to Australian ABC News, that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from the Balik Papan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
We're a nut-snake, he added.
The authorities fear that the death rate can reach thousands, and the country's disaster response reports that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The death rate is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins, and it is not possible to reach them,” said the spokesman Sutpo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, which is holding a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are flying in emergency aid and supplies.
The 35 - year - old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to Sky News: “A new ambulance of several bodies comes every minute.
There's a shortage of clean water.
All the stores have been looted.
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’re finding.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country’s military: “I am asking you all to work around the clock to carry out all duties related to the evacuation.
If you're ready, he said, CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombrok earlier in the year, where more than 550 people died.
Air crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed in the lagoon of the Pacific Ocean, Micronesia, says that a man is missing, although previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members were evacuated from the descending aircraft.
According to a press release Air Niugini states that on Saturday afternoon a male passenger could not be located.
The airline announced cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned to requests for more information about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew, after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline states that six passengers stayed at the hospital Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is still not clear what caused the crash and the exact order of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very low water.
\"It was really lucky,\" said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers could go in water for life to get to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the crew panicked and shouted and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors working to renovate a dock nearby also helped in rescue work by using a rubber boat to transport persons on land before the plane sank at about 30 metres depth.
Data from Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents with PNG registered airlines in the last two decades but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analysts determine the timeline of the night when a woman was burned alive
The D.A. closed its evidence on Saturday during the appeal for a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
An analyst in the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, gave testimony for several hours as expert witnesses in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used telecommunications information to put together the progress of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said that he got location data from several different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to his previous claims, writes The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time he had claimed that with his friend Michael Sanford, he visited Sanford.
Sanford sat in the witness stand Saturday and told me he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was \"no, because my truck was in Nashville\"
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
He erased her from his life, said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that day.
The High Breed: What is political hip-hop?
A hiphoptrio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that hiphop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They will return to the starting point and make political hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently received a Revival in the UK due to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York nanny sues couples after firing with “racistic” text messages
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory firing after having received a text message by mistake from her mother complaining that she was “still a black person,”
The couple denied that they were racists but compared the case to blackmail.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who is the mother of two, expressed her horror at finding out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up on her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEJ, NOT A LAST PERSON,” wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, the “uncomfortably” Plasco-Flaxman Giselle Maurice fired and said that their former nanny, as from African-American, had been bad at work and that instead she expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day's work and sent home in an Uber.
Now Giselle Maurice is suing the couple to get compensation for the firing and compensation for 350 dollars a day in the six months where she should have stayed with the family, even though this had been agreed without a contract.
“I’d like to show them that you can’t do anything like that,” she said to the newspaper on Friday and added “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple has defended themselves with the fact that they are not racists and that the firing of Maurice was justified because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
My wife had come to send her something she wouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists,\" said Joel Plasco to The Post.
“ But would you leave your children to someone to whom you had been rude, even if it had happened by mistake?
Your baby?
Come on.
Plasco compared the trial to “depression — and that his wife had given birth two months earlier and was in a very difficult situation —
Are you really going after someone like that?
This is not very kind of done, the investment adviser added.
Although the trial is still under way, the Civil Service Tribunal has already written off the couple on social media and cut off their behaviour and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that readers could not relate to a speaking bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was taken up for publication, said of the letter: “It’s hard to imagine being the one who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's pretty fun to read now when you know how popular Paddington became...
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC, before he was inspired to write the children's book about a little piece of clothing, would have been optimistic, even though his story was rejected, and that the 60th year of publishing the books was \"bitter-dead\" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important part of our family” and says that her father in all modesty was proud of his success.
\"He was a quiet man, and he didn't like to brag,\" she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt as if you had a child who achieved something: You’re proud of them, even though it’s not really your profit.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Even though it was his work and his imagination, he used to say it was Paddington's fault.
Said goodbye to a dying daughter over the phone
After the landing, her daughter was taken to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors in vain tried to save her life.
“Nad made regular calls to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn’t survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nad that she would die in the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said: “Tashi, I love you so much, my darling.
I'll see you soon.
See you.
The medicine she had received to keep her heart running slowly lost their effect.
She was dead shortly before, and now her body was shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to get together.
Finally, the grieving Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane with the other passengers who had no idea what she was going through.
No one knew, she said.
“ I bent my head, and the tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Grieving women are trying to stop suicide jumpers
Two women who have lost relatives of suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up a map on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he had a depression, and 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to experience the grief I live through every day,” she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with a infected smile.
His smile was known to everyone.
People said his smiles lit up the room.
But he stopped working before he died because he felt really bad.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him after he killed himself.
Sharon Davis said: “I’m always afraid it’s spreading.
Sharon Davis made the cards to “tell people that there is someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don’t go with your thoughts yourself — you have to talk to anyone —
Sharon Davis' long-standing friend Kelly Humphreys lost her boyfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
\"He didn't say anything about him being upset or depressed or anything,\" she said.
“ Some days before Christmas he began to change.
When the kids opened their presents, he had no eye contact with them at all.
She said that his death was very traumatic for them, but that they have to get through it: “It has created a hole in our family.
It's torn us apart.
But we all have to continue and fight...

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still unsolved while the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for — a limited amount of time — we could perhaps get a little consensus,” said Flake on Saturday and added that he feared that the comet had fallen off his back — in the middle of the locked partial situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to carry out their investigation?
Their restraint is due to the timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if the Republicans, as expected, fail badly, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to elect to the highest judge in the country.
George W. Bush has called Senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House of Bush and thereby met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI finishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the decisive vote and elect him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors during Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from South Korea’s Ministry of Collection and said that there were 1,127 defectors last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human smugglers were contributing to the changed figures.
Pyongyang has not given any official comments.
The vast majority of North Korea’s defectors are eventually offered citizenship in South Korea.
The Government of South Korea states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border offensive up to North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China sees the defectors as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, so they are often forced to return home.
The relationship between North and South Korea - which is technically still at war - has improved considerably in the last few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met to talk about the stranded negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happens after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korea on an overall level.
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed American sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances it is ruled out that we will arm ourselves,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh \"hysterical\" and says he's unfit for the Supreme Court.
The president of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated Supreme Court judges, “hysterically” and said that his temper was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi’s comment came in an interview Saturday to the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had behaved like that, they would have called her hysterical,” said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony in front of the Senate Legal Committee last Thursday.
Kavanaugh dispelled the accusations that he had committed a sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he spoke of his family and his years in high school, he almost cried and was crying.
He also condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him “gross and coordinated characterism,” organized by the left wing, who was angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential post in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not sit in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was prejudiced against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with the statements and the way he went after the Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
The Pelosi way around when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to a Kingdom court if he were confirmed and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I would say that if he wasn’t telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, but definitely in the court he’s in now,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions in relation to Obama's health reform or the abortion case Roe v. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings Kavanaugh did not answer questions as to whether he would reverse certain previous decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It must not happen that a hysterical, preeminent person must contest a job as a judge and expect us to say ‘yes, it’s not just great,” said Pelosi.
And women have to use it.
It is a righteous outcome, for months and years of anger, over which she cannot get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry, ” Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's abnormal.
She continued: “I received much support from a woman who was the boss who said that she also cried when she became angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she became angry and started to cry, she would say to the person she spoke to: “You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
But I'm angry.
And then she just kept coming.
And I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my most obvious memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with an overweight of men, where I often cried with anger, where I was taken by the neck of an older woman - a cold boss, whom I had always been a little afraid of - and pulled out on the stairs.
You must never let them see that you're crying, she said to me.
They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad and they'll pay for it.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Congress of the Democrats from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed in having an affair on a boat named Monkey Business and withdrew as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and found that she could as well set up as a presidential candidate herself.
“It wasn’t a very well - thought - out decision,” she said to me 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and they certainly did not need another candidate.
Some called it the Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was behind with fundraising, so she promised she wouldn't take part unless she collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She found out that some of her supporters, who gave her $1,000 for men, only gave her $250.
They think I'm getting a discount, she thought.
When she gave a talk about her not wanting to stand up, she was overwhelmed by feelings - grateful to the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to raise money and reach voters instead of voters, and anger at sexism - that she got a lump in her throat.
“You might think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls how the press responded to her.
You'd think I was sponsored by Cleenex.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my tombstone?
She was crying.
How the trade war between the United States and China can be an advantage for Beijing
The openings in the trade war between the United States and China were loud, and even though the battle is far from over, disunity between countries can be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
The US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by customsing key Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest escalation this week with new customs duties affecting goods worth USD 200 billion applies in principle to half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has every time reimbursed, most recently by imposing customs duties of 5-10% on American goods for USD 60 billion.
China has sworn to follow the United States all the way, and the world's second-largest economy is probably not giving after just preliminary.
If it gets Washington to withdraw its demands, it means they're giving in, but to China's president, Xi Jinping, it would be too embarrassing to bow to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, American pressure in the trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
“A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the groundwork for an economy that can get out of control in both countries, and it’s actually much more dangerous than you thought,” said Abigail Grace, researcher with focus on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' to receive refugees, believes Foreign Minister
Syria says that it is ready for the refugees to return and ask for help to build the country that has been destroyed by the war of more than seven years.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
“Today the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to have control over the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore a normal state.
All the conditions are now in place for refugees to return to the country they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that hit their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since 2011 when the war began.
A further six million people still in the country need emergency aid.
Mr Al-Moualem said that the Syrian Government would like to receive help to rebuild the affected country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries which helped to support the rebellion.
Europe secures Ryder Cup Sair in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 and beat the American team 16.5 - 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy back when Captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points it required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who found it difficult in most of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake on par 3 on the 16th hole, causing him to lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari managed well on all rounds and became 1 out of a total of 4 players who have received 5-0-0 since 1979, where the tournament's current format began.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 of the lowest ranked European player, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
No. 1 on the World Series, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who might have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in the luggage, Spainrd Sergio Garcia, became the most winning European tournament with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a hard year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm really happy to get the trophy back.
It's a team effort, and I'm glad I could help,\" said a feeling-charged Garcia after the European victory.
He's sending the torch to his countryman John Ram, who fell the American golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 on a single match Sunday.
\"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, and I followed him as a child,\" said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history on 13-21-3.
It's a joke statistics for one of the best golfers ever who's won 14 big titles, only exceeded by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had all weekend problems finding the shape with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The U.S. Captain Jim Furyk, after his team’s disappointing display, said: “I’m proud of the boys because they were fighting for the case.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe a counter-play.
We lost.
The hat for Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We will regroup, and I will cooperate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move on.
I love the 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to light your hat.
We were defeated.
Update on algae flowering: Concentrations are reduced in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that there is a general decline in algae concentration in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to FWC, dispersal is reported in the area around Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, suggesting that the concentration is decreasing.
The flowering of algae spreads over a coast of 210 km from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
There are less blooms about 16 km from the coast of Hillsborough County, but there are fewer than last week.
There are also bloatings observed in Pasco County.
Medium concentrations in or at sea have been reported in Pinellas County during the last week, low to high concentrations in the sea off Hillsborough County, background concentration to high concentrations in Manatee County, background concentration to high concentrations in or in the sea off Sarasota County, background concentration to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, background concentration to high concentrations in or in the sea off Lee County and low concentrations in Collier County.
Breathing difficulties continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
No breathing difficulties have been reported in the northwest of Florida in the past week.
