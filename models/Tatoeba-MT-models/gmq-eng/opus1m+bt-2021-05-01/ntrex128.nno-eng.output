Welsh members of the National Assembly are afraid not to be taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly were recently dismayed at a proposal to change names from an assemble member or AM (Member of the Assembly) to a member of the Welsh Parliament or MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reaction came because of plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
Members of several political parties are concerned that they can be ridiculed.
A member from Labour said that his group is concerned about your “MWP rhymes on Twp and Pwp”
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, \"twp\" means foolish and \"pwp\" shit.
A member of the Plaid Party said that the group “is not naked” and has proposed options.
A Welsh Conservative member said that his group has an \"open mind\" when it comes to the name change, but added MWP is not far from the word \"muppet\".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is not unlike the English Yorkshire dialect in its pronunciation of the letter u.
The National Assembly's delegation, which now writes a bill to introduce the change of names, said: \"The final decision as to which members of the National Assembly are to be called will, of course, be up to members themselves.\"
A Welsh official decision of 2017 empowered the National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the proposals for names, which showed considerable support for calling the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the title of national assembly members, the delegation prefers a Welsh parliamentary member or WMP, while the MWP elections received the most support during the public hearing.
Although the members of the National Assembly may have made other suggestions, the struggle to become a national has given the leader of the delegation, Elin Jones, the main body, to deliver the bill in a couple of weeks' time.
The legislative reform includes other changes to the functioning of the delegation, including rules on disqualification of members of the assembly and the design of a committee system.
Assembly members will be able to vote on their name when discussing the bill.
Macedonians vote in public repudiation to change the country’s name
On Sunday, the selectors are going to use their name to change their country's name to the North-Macedonia Republic.
The popular evocation was determined to resolve a conflict that has been going on for decades with neighboring Greece, whose own province is called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of neighbouring countries in the north represents a claim on the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the public consultation about the name change, said he's going to look away from the result.
Those who support the public voice, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price of joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin are slowing down while the churches of Harlem, New York, strivar
'The old ones I've been talking to said that in the old days it was a bar and a church on every corner,' said Adams.
\"Today there is no part of it.\"
He said he understands why the bars disappear.
\"People socialize in other ways these days,\" he said.
\"Children are no longer in the neighborhood that people visit by the usual.\"
When it comes to the churches, he is concerned that money from selling real estates won't last as long as the leaders believe, 'and sooner or later they're back where they started.'
He added that churches can be replaced by cooperativeities filled with the kind of people who don't care to help the historic places in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy cooperatives in these buildings are white,” he said. “and so comes the day when all the churches are closed down, because it is not likely that these people who move into the cooperatives will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built of white soda before Harlem became a black town - Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin Church a decade later.
The original white Methodist Convention moved out in the 1930s.
A black parish that had the narration in its vicinity moved into the building.
Saint Martin was taken over by a black sock lease by pastor John Howard Johnson, who also rented the boycott of shopkeepers in the 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem where the owners objected to the appointment or promotion of black.
The building suffered great damage in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson’s followers planned to rebuild him, they also ordered a new bell game.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Johnson Senior and successor of Saint Martin, was proud and called the bell game “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who played the bell game in July called it \"one cultural tax\" and \"one historical instrument that cannot be replaced.\"
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the first bell game in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who leaves the church to play the larger bell game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that Saint Martin did not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in St. Martin in recent months has become a complicated story about architects and construction workers, some of whom were added by the laymen of the church, and others by the Episcopal diocese.
Sachrist, who hires the sock and consists of the leaders of the laity, wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the bison ‘would ask the sacristy to pay,’ although the sacristy was not involved in the bispod's addition of architects and builders.
Some members of the sock have complained of the lack of openness from the bispod.
13-year-old damage to shark during humming dive in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday while he dived for lobsters in California on the opening day of the hummar season.
Take her just before 7:00 in the morning near the Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented to the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had divers for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard that the gut called for help; he paddled to the mud with a group and pulled out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought only the gut was enthusiastic about having a prisoner a hummar, before he realized that the guten cried \"noko bit me!
\"Someone bit me.\"
Hammel said, “Heila his collarbone was torn off,” he observed when he reached the gut.
\"I cried that everyone must get out of the water: There is a shark in the water!\" added Hammel.
The guy was taken by air ambulance and taken to Rady Hospital for children in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
It's not sure what kind of shark it was that repented the gut.
Bad guard Captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but that shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles added a serious injury to the upper body.
The authorities linked access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that more than 135 species of shark exist in the area, but most people are not believed to be dangerous.
Sainsbury Store Chains bet on beauty products
The British chain of stores Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenham's beauty products and offer supermarket services at the store.
As part of an investment in Britain's beauty market, worth £2.8 billion, and continue to grow while fashion and interiors go down, Sainsbury's will test their beauty products in 11 stores next year, and several shops if it becomes a success.
The investment in the beauty product is a time when the shelves used to be filled with TVs, microwaves and interiors are now empty.
Sainbury's said they should double the number of beauty products to 3000 products and offer the trademarks Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
They should give the L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand as in the Boots stores.
The shop will also relaunch its own makeup series Boutique and make most products vegan, which will attract several young customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test the hall of its perfumes in two of Sainsbury's shops. The first open in Croydon, London, last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online action and shifting to buying small amounts of food every day from local small shops means that large retail chains need to find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, a manager of Sainsbury's, has commented that shopkeepers will look more and more like department stores, while shop chains are trying to fight the low-cost shops Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's has joined up with the interior chain Argos in hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat stores, since they bought both chains two years ago. Sainsbury's claims that this has increased the food store and thus defended the purchase.
The shop chain's earlier attempt to renew the care and pharmacy department was not a success.
Sainsbury's collaboration with Boots early in the 21st century, but this ended when the parties did not agree on how to share the profit from the pharmacy in the store.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy chain Celesio, who had 281 pharmacy and owned Lloyd's pharmacy chain, for $125 million three years ago.
They added Lloyds still has a role to play and will offer an extended luxury series of skin products, including brand La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: \"We have changed how beauty shelves will look and be experienced to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also added colleagues with special skills to offer beauty tests.
Our trademarks are designed to suit all needs, while the attractive environment and practical locations mean that we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of acting.\"
Peter Jones 'Rassing' after Holly Willoghby withdraws from an agreement worth $11 million
The star of the TV program Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is 'racing' after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a deal with his lifestyle brand worth £11 million to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time to promote their interior and secondary brand True.
The couple's cooperation has been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop mark.
The host of this Morning program, 37, made the news known on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the stars of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, in the midst of the development of their new cooperation on a lifestyle brand to focus on his own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was 'racing' when the Golden Holly confessed during a strained meeting on Tuesday at Jones's business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly's new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - means that she no longer has time to cooperate on the interior and secondary brand Truly.
The collaboration has been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop mark and was supposed to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of $11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to make known that it would not work with Truly, while Jones escaped Britain to calm down in one of his holiday homes.
One source said: \"Trully was definitely at the top of Holly's priorities.
It was to be her long - term plan for the future, and it was to last for decades.
Her determination to withdraw has surprised everyone involved.
No one believed their own ears on Tuesday, Truly was so close to launch.
There is a store in Marlow filled with goods ready for sale.\"
Experts believe that the decision to this Morning host, which is one of the richest stars in Britain, can cost the company millions of dollars because of intense product investment, from pillows to candles to clothes and interiors, and can cause delaying with the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, has been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created the brand Truly together with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman of the board in March.
Para vacations together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's programme I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night: \"We don't comment on his business.\"
Hard talk, \"and we fall in love.\"
He joked about the criticism he was going to get from the media to make a comment that some might experience as \"upresident\" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Said Trump in his customs vote as 'news Talker'.
\"I have given up nothing.\"
He commented that Kim is interested in a new meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step towards the disarmament of the nuclear program in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the nuclear weapons program have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the North Korean Ri Yong Ho top diplomat said to the world leaders of the UN World Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not received a 'representative response' from the United States of America on its early disarmament.
Instead, he added, continue the United States with sanctions to press North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
He said, “It is going great between us and North Korea.”
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship.’
He added that his work to improve relations with Kim has brought positive results - the end of rocket testing, help free hostages and return rents to American soldiers.
He defended his unusual way of dealing with Kim.
'It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in, we had about 200 people standing right there,' said Trump and the point to the group that stood before him.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia destroy island and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign relief organisations were told there was no need for them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s inhabitants had to flee, no declared national crisis is needed for international relief.
\"Unfortunately,\" said Sumbung, \"they have in many cases been very clear that they do not want international help.
While the Red Children put together a team to travel to Palu, it is still not certain if added foreign passports are allowed to work in the field.
Sutpo, chairman of the National Crisis Agency in Indonesia, said that the authorities are considering the situation in Palu to see if international organizations are allowed to provide help.
Although Indonesia is often exposed to earthquakes, the land is not particularly forewarned by the forces of nature.
In the Aceh area, they have built shelters for tsunamis, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
Despite warnings against tsunamis in Palu, there was no alarm, which most likely led to more victims.
Traveling between Indonesian islands is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to treat those injured in the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on improving the infrastructure in Indonesia during the presidential elections, and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railways.
But lack of funding has made it difficult for the administration of President Joko, and next year there is another choice.
President Joko is also under pressure when the sectarian tensions in Indonesia are in debt, while members of the Muslim majority have accepted his conservative belief.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands had to flee when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets and used machetes, arrows, and bows, and other primitive weapons.

\"I saw that Kante came and lost the ball once, and then I shot the ball.\"
Chelsea rented 1-0 after the after-scoring break in the 25 minute of the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Before the target, Hazard gave the ball to Mateo Kovacic before he ran off near the midway into the Liverpool half.

Parliamentary statue of Cromwell will be the last victim of 'rewriting of history'
The removal of the statue would be karma for Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious objects in England that his puritanic followers did during the civil war of the 1600s.
However, the Cromwell League describes Crick's proposal to remove the statue as \"noise\" and \"try to write about history.\"
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell League, said: \"It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace would be a goal.
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was the choir ordered or performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been given the action of his ancestor Thomas for centuries before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent representation of Cromwell is proof of public opinion in the 19th century, and is part of historiography of a figure that many still thought it was worth celebrating.\"
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: \"Cromwell was in the 1800s, and is still today considered a defender of Parliament against external pressure, and in his case, of course, it was against the monarchy.
Whether or not this representation is correct is still a subject for debate in history.
What's certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual that we know represented one side of it distinctly.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering.\"
Murderer pig attack and kill Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China, following local media reports.
The man, with the last name Yuan, was found dead, with a cut of arteries and covered with blood, near a pig binger on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is expected to vaccinate pigs on a guard on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, he found his cousin dead, and discovered that one of the pigs was open.
He said that in the bing there was a big male pig with blood around his mouth.
The autopsy showed that a 250 - pound [250 kg] pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
«Beina to my cousin was bloody and destroyed,» said the cousin, by the name of Wu, to Guiyang Evening News.
Watch camera shows Yuan came to the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Even News that the pig had been locked up to prevent him from attacking others, while the police were gathering evidence of the crime scene.
Yuan's family now negotiates compensation with the market leader.
Even if it's rare, these attacks from pigs have happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, causing serious damage to the man.
Ten years ago, a 295-pound pig kept a Welsh farmer trapped between him and a tractor until his wife frightened the pig away.
After a farmer in Oregon became eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to the CBC News reported that pigs are not aggressive normally but that the taste of blood can trigger the animals.
'They only want to play.
They like to bite a little, they're curious... they won't hurt you.
You must only have enough respect for them,' he said.
Rests of Hurricane Rosa Brings Rain to the Southwest of the United States
As predicted in the weather report, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker over cool waters along the northern coast of Mexico.
Still, Rosa will prepare the rains for North Mexico and South West America in the next few days.
Rosa had a wind force up to 136 km/h and was a hurricane of category 1 up to 5:00 in the eastern time zone of the United States on Sunday, and the Hurricane Center was 620 miles [620 km] southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa's moving north on Sunday.
In the meantime, there is a low pressure over the Pacific that moves east towards the west coast of the United States. Rosa comes nearer Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical humidity northward to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to two inches [25 cm] of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will react with the low pressure and cause thick rain in the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, between three and ten inches [3 and 10 cm] of rain can create dangerous whistles and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will result in rain of between 5 and 7 centimetres per hour in some parts of the southwest U.S., especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimetres of rain is expected in parts of the southwest U.S.; especially over large parts of Arizona.
Hazardous calamities may occur because of scattered terrain and tropical rains.
The danger of tropical rain prevents tourism in the desert on foot.
The rain can turn canyons into embarrassing rivers, and lightning and thunderstorms will bring strong winds and dust.
The coming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the coast of southern California.
Total rainfalls of more than one inch (1 cm) is possible, which can create small particles and smooth paths.
This will be the first rainy city for the season in the region.
Spreading tropical rainy villages will start in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain rises late Monday and Tuesday.
The Four Corners region can wait a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October can testify intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic gets colder, but tropical areas will still be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic differences in temperature, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
There's almost 20 degrees apart between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
The next days, late summer heat will try to build up and spread again.
A lot of central and austress America is expected to experience a warm start on October, with 25 degrees and up from southwards of the big plains to parts of North East America.
New York City can reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term warning indicates that there are high chances of above average temperatures in east-USA through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh's voice
On Thursday, more than 20 million people saw the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court and a woman in charge of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different television channels.
At the same time, the political discussion around the story continued, interrupted in the standard TV shows of different broadcasting companies to reveal the last new hands on Friday: a unity reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that during the next week the FBI will investigate the debt.
Ford told the Supreme Court Committee that she's 100 percent sure Kavanaugh felt like he was drunk trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, during a sensitive raise, he's 100% sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20,4 million people saw the height on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The Society reached this number by finding the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC.
Speak was not clear from other channels that showed the height, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has trouble counting viewers who watch from the office.
To put this in perspective, a similar number of viewers are looking at an American football final or Oscar distribution.
Fox News’ hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the canal was also the one with most viewers during the day with 5.69 million viewers, said Nielsen.
ABC was in second place 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.44 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
People are still interested in the hearing.
Flake was in focus during the drama on Friday.
After being a moderate Republican, Flake declared himself on Kavanaugh’s side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while Protestants called for him on his way to a hearing with a judicial committee on Friday.
He was looking at the ground for several minutes while the Protestants were yelling at him on CNN live.
\"I am standing before you,\" said one woman.
“Do you ask him to tell the truth to our land?”
Some said to him, \"You have power, and so many women are powerless.\"
Flake said his office spoke, and before he went into the elevator, he said he would have more to say under the committee floor.
The Broadcasting Office showed the voice on television when the jury was to vote for or against the nomination of Kavanaugh to the full senate and further smoking.
But Flake said he could only do that if the FBI investigates the claims against Kavanaugh during the next week, which the Democrats have also requested.
Flake was partly overreacted after talking to his friend, democrat, and senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision turned out to have power, because it became clear that the Republicans could not vote for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May owes critics to play politics when it comes to Brexit
The Prime Minister of Britain, Theresa May, owes the critics of her plans to leave the EU to \"play politics\" with the future of Britain without regard to national interests, in an interview with the newspaper The Sunday Times.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to participate in the Conservative Party's conference on 29 September 2018.
In addition to the interview with May on the front of the Sunday Times, an interview with former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, where he is taking action on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, says that the proposal for Britain and the European Union to collect each other's contributions is 'totally absurd'.
Wayde Sims shooting in the United States: The police arrest the suspect Dyteon Simpson for the Sims shooting.
Police have arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), was killed.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and jailed for deliberate murder, says the police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
An official video shows the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, following a report from the WAFB channel, which is linked to CBS.
After his high ground with Simpson, the police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
The commission to Simpson was set at $350,000, reporting The Advocate's local visa.
The coroner in East Baton Rouge published an early autopsy report on Friday that showed that the year of death was a shot in the head walking into the neck.
The Baton Rouge police are thanking the Louisiana State Police Special Forces, their state police, the Southern University police, and local residents to help them find Simpson.
The athletic director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the local police for being \"vigilant in the achievement of justice.\"
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 meter high basketball player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average, he score 5.6 points with 2.6 setbacks per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team is \"treasureless\" after Wayde was killed.
\"This is something we are always afraid of,\" said Wade.
Volcano spews over Mexico City
The Popocatepetl volcano has reached southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Emergency Prevention Centre asks Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after the activity increased in the crater and the centre registered 183 gas and osceluts within 24 hours.
The center had observed several ripples and tremors.
Social media images show thin layers of weeds on cars in various neighborhoods of Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometers south-east of the capital city, since an earthquake with a strength of 7.1 happened in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as \"Don Goyo\" and has been active since 1994.
Police come together with Catalan separatists within the anniversary of their self-restraint
Six Protestants were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters for independent noise with police forces, and thousands of other demonstrators protested against self - control one year after the voice of any exorcism from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces, throwing eggs and powder polish that created dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
The union also broke out later in the day, and the police used batons to prevent escalation.
For several hours the separatists cried out, \"Don't forget, don't forgive\" while the Protestants against self-proclaim, \"Long live Spain.\"
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were treated for minor injuries after protests.
The voice is still pressed in the region and many will still have self-centered one year after October 1st, which was called illegal by Madrid, but became fair by separatists in Catalonia.
Most of the selections were self-explanatory, but there was also a low selectivity among those who were against self-sustaining and boyictting.
According to Catalan officials, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the voice and the valoric union occurred in the region.
Groups who were too independent slept in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
The demonstration still went off the stack, but it had to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, one electrician who shared in the separatist protests with his wife, said that he no longer has the hope of independence in Catalonia.
\"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy to be able to speak for themselves, but now we are stuck again,\" he said.
Although they won the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties who are too independent to hold power this year, while many of their leaders are in exile or arrest while awaiting the trial of their role in the organisation of the people's East and the subsequent Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who filmed protests in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict was headed up by politicians on both sides.
'The tension is increasing more and more,' he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been part of ongoing trials since last year, declared that he will be running for elections in the European Parliament next year.
'To stand as a candidate for European elections is the best way of condemning the backdrop of democratic values and the oppression we have experienced from the Spanish state,' he said.

Menga shot gives Livingston 1-siger over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston Sikrs says
Amid 18 games that train for the Ibrox club in Glasgow, he's excited about the Rangers and Steven Gerrard.
Dolly Menga's shot turned out to make the difference, while Gary Holt's side might even join Hibernian in others.
Gerrard's side has no overshoots in the Scottish Premiery league this season, and will play against Hearts, which they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will be hosting Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has six wins in a row, and main coach Holt has still not lost since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston's missing chances of the away team.
Holt's team was supposed to rent long before they scora, and created more problems for Rangers with their direct gig.
Scott Robinson broke through, but had a low effort against goals, which meant that Alan Lithgow had to work hard after the meeting with Craig Halkett's heading over the goal.
The home team was content to let Rangers play ahead of them, knowing that they could cause trouble for the away team.
And that's how the determining target was scora.
Rangers went to a free kick and Livingston made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson went against Menga, who took a touch and scora from the middle of the punishment field.
Before that, Rangers dominated the ball, but saw that home defense was solid and Keeper Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continues into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save a target.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but he was stopped by Rangers' keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow flew long after the ball was returned from Livingston.
Pasningar was sent back and forth in the Livingston punishment field, while two penalties--after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one by hand--was waved away.
The Phenomenal of Livingston Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont in Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal battle and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Each player played fantastically and still impresses on the curve up.
Their playing and playing style has hardly changed since they returned to the top class, but much of the thanks for the way he has shocked the team since he was trained.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense and organized a military defense, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell throughout the battle.
The Rangers were in contrast not motivated.
Even so, even though they were under Gerrard, they were not good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, and just cut up the home half once, which should make the Rangers realize that they won't reach any longer.
Erdogan gets mixed welcome in Cologne
The leaders of Turkey and Germany smiled under blue skies when they met to eat breakfast on Saturday, September 29, Berlin.
It's the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is hopeful to repair relations between the two NATO countries.
The countries have our own interests in the face of human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's role in the European Union.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police prevented a population of over 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque for ‘security reasons’, but many of Erdogan’s supporters met up to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan - many of the Kurdish - also came forward to condemn Erdogan’s politics and the German state’s decision to welcome him to the country.
The dual Protestants reflected different German Turks, who view Erdogan as a hero, and others, who view him as an autocrat.

Hurricane Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with embarrassing (for drought area)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but it is just such a weather phenomenon that is heading towards Arizona early next week, in the remnants of Hurricane Rosa moves southwest across the desert and creates fear of embarrassment.
The National Weather Service has issued warnings on Monday and Tuesday in Western Arizona and South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the towns Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and can give rain already late Monday.
The national weather service in Phoenix twitra that only 'ten tropical cyclones have had tropical storm or low-pressure status within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that reached 60 kilometers within the Arizona border.”
The last models from the National Hurricane Center report from 5 to 10 centimetres of rain, with isolated quantities up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
It can count from two to five inches [2 to 5 cm] in other regions of the southwest desert, including central parts of Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, with isolated totals up to ten inches [10 cm].
For areas that are out of bounds, the number from Rosa may be a good sign in the dry state.
Although embarrassing is a serious concern, this rainy good area of the southwest U.S. is likely to be exposed to drought.
According to the United States, extreme droughts in over 40 percent of Arizona, the second highest category of drought, are reporting weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is moving across Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
With wind of over 135 miles per hour, Rosa is on Sunday morning, 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.

Trump defeats Kavanaugh \"fell\" under the guise and anger of the Democrats against him
'The voice of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the merciless and unimaginable tactics of the Democrats,' said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has “felt” under the guise and anger of the Democrats were through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave a witness to the Congress on Thursday, and emotionally denied the debt from Christine Blasey Ford that he assaulted her sexually several decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave evidence of her debts during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the \"American people got to see how brilliant and brave\" Kavanaugh was that day.
'The voice of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to one of the finest lawyers today, a lawyer with faultless services in the public,' he said to a lot of followers in West Virginia.
The president also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he talked about how important it is for the Republicans to voice in the middle-ups of the United States.
Five weeks to one of the most important options in our lives.
I don't ask, but I really do,' he said.
'That is why I travel round about to fight for good candidates.'
Trump argued that the Democrats are looking to 'stand up and block'.
The first important voice in the Senate about the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to happen last Friday, said a Republican representative to CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, numbering on the killing increases
At least 384 people are killed, many of them taken by massive waves on beaches, while a powerful earthquake and a tsunami framed the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, reported authority on Sunday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to participate in a festival on the beach of Palu on Friday when the waves, six meters high, struck the beach at sunset, and took many people while they destroyed everything they came across.
The tsunami came after an earthquake of 7.5.
“When warning about the tsunami came yesterday, there were still people on the beach who didn’t leave immediately and that’s how they became victims,” said Sutpo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the crisis relief agency in Indonesia GDPB, in Jakarta.
“As if the tsunami weren’t enough in itself, he took cars, tree trunks, houses; he hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, and added that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climb into trees to avoid the tsunami and thus survive.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos from the air published by the crisis agency show many broken buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
After all, continue to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes could be marked in the area, with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia’s agency for testing and testing technology (BPPT) said that the energy from the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the energy from the nuclear bomb over Hiroshima during the second world war.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, said the agency.
Nugroho said that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the deceased have been found during the rest of the collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 people were injured and 29 are still missing.
Nugroho said that the number of casualties and the size of destructions may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is nearer epicentered to the earthquake.
\"We haven't heard anything from Dongala,\" said Nugroho.
“More than 300,000 people live there,” said the Red Cross, adding that their added and volunteers are on their way to the rough areas.
'This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse' said the Red Cross.
The crisis agency was on Saturday criticized for not informing us that a tsunami had hit Palu, even though the authorities said that waves were coming within the time that was warned.
An amateur video divided on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building that desperately calls out to people down the streets to protect them against the coming wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hits the coast and brings along buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the video immediately.
The quake and the tsunami are a spring break and cut off the communications around Palu, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the naudhelp.
The military has started the process of sending Naed Helploaders from Jakarta and other cities, reporting the authorities, but refugees still need food and other basic needs.
The city’s airfield was reopened for relief, but will continue to be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
The number of casualties in Indonesia exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
They added to the World Vision from Dongala have arrived safely in the city of Palu and have set up tents in their office’s backyard, and on their way to the city, Doseba said.
'They told me they saw many broken houses,' he said.
It's very bad.
While relief agencies start work on helping those affected by the tsunami, some complain that foreign emergency workers with crisis - dealing expertise have been denied entry to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign relief organisations and their associated work cannot begin before Indonesia has declared the area to be a national crisis zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
'It's a crisis at province level,' said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
\"When the state says \"OK, this is a national crisis,\" we can open up for international nad help, but they have not yet updated the status.\"
It is evening again in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, and friends and family of those who are still missing still hope for a miracle, but know that such natural disasters do not end well.
On Saturday, a little guy was saved from the sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was rescued from the remains of a collapsed building, where she had a doctor trapped next to her dead mother for two days.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglidians from the Asian games that were finished earlier this month in Indonesia.
One man called Mandaki said that some of those prisoners in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
\"As one with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have an emotional burden to bear,\" he said.
Gendon said he desperately sent whatsApp messages to the Palu paragliders, who had taken part in the local beach festival, after he heard that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages only showed a gray chin, instead of two blue chins.
'I believe that means that the messages did not appear,' he said.
Thieves steal $26 750 from minibank in Newport, Levee, United States
On Friday the thieves stole $26 750 from a worker at Brink's in what he was about to fill up a minibank in Newport, Levee, U.S.A., following a press release from the Newport police.
The worker had just left a minibank in the entertainment area and was about to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the press release.
While the worker was busy, \"a man sprung up behind the worker\" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses observed several suspects as they escaped from the scene, following the press release, but the police could not determine the number of persons involved in the robbery.
If anyone has information about who was involved, they should call the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rape pair renames Ye
The rapper Kanye West is named - to Ye.
He declared the name change on Twitter on Saturday, and wrote: \"The creature once known as Kanye West.\"
West, 41, has had Ye as his nickname for a while, using the name as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The name change came just before he was to appear on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to drop his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show after she canceled because of \"emotional causes,\" said the program host.
In addition to being an abbreviated of his current artist name, West has said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
'I believe the word 'yes' is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,' West said earlier this year discussing the album title with the Big Boy radiovert.
\"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
The name has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye- only to reflect the good we do, the bad we do, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects on who we are.”
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared his preferred name Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, which has collaborated with West before, has also changed the style of the name with and without hyphen and upper case.
Future President of Mexico promises not to send the military against civilians
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to send military forces against civilians, and soon the country will mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody treatment of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he will “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the military shot at peaceful protestors and killed about 300 people, at a time when left-orientated student gestures spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to students and opening several free universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of access to education have led youths to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double investment in artificial intelligence
Since China is working more actively with artificial intelligence, the US should double its investment in research on the subject, telling the investor and user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the U.S. government spoke of artificial intelligence, although the United States lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China introduced its plan last year, aiming to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
'One doubling of the artificial intelligence research budget would be a good start, since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence,' said Lee.
A doubling of funding can double the chances that the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence is happening in the United States, Lee said to CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book 'AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order' this month via the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the largest artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highest ranking player of the game Othello, and later he worked as a leader in Microsoft Research and was foreman in Google in China.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions organized by the United States, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked how long the next competition will be, so that he will be involved and identify the next visionaries.
Scientists in the United States usually have to work hard to get government support, said Lee.
'It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's the big companies,' said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have rented excellent university students to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen research on artificial intelligence.
\"I thought that doctoral students before artificial intelligence should have automatic retention rights,\" he said.
The Government of China published its plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Association for Science finances students at academic institutions, not unlike the American National Association of Sciences and other state organizations, its way of distributing money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center of artificial intelligence, designed to involve industrial and academic partners, and the White House declared the formation of an artificial intelligence committee.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI (artic intelligence) Next.
The National Science Association invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, no one has worked on the national security and artificial intelligence bill in months.
Macedonians vote in public repudiation to change the country's name
The Macedonian people voiced on Sunday in a public detour if they should change their name to the Republic of North Macedonia to solve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, insists that the name of neighbouring countries in the north represents a claim for their territory and has used veto to vote against membership of Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change of name may undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the people in Macedonia.
President Ivanov has said that he will not vote in public revoting, and a boycott has sowed doubts as to how far the public is going to reach the at least 50 percent of the population it needs in order to be valid.
The question on the public consultation note is: ‘Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership and in agreement with Greece?’
Support players for the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of name change is worth EU membership and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that achieved its own after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
'I am here today to voice for the future of this country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,' said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the voice is not binding under the law, a sufficient number of Members of this House have said that they will follow the outcome of the voice to make her decisive.
In order for the name change to take place, Parliament needs two thirds of an agreement.
The State Election Committee reported that nothing unusual had happened before 13:00.
Only 16 percent had voice, in contrast to 34 percent in previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 of all registered voters spoke.
\"I'm the voice of my children, we belong in Europe,\" said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a elector in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son Dushko, the voicer in Strumika, in the folk voice in Macedonia, to change their names and open their doors to join NATO and the EU on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of public revelry in front of Parliament in Skopje, by setting up tents and chairs.
'We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not to change the name of our country,' Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us under the name Macedonia, we can go to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev has stated that NATO membership will attract investors to Macedonia, which has more than 20 percent unemployment.
“I believe that the majority will vote for the change, by the 80 percent of our citizens will become members of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said, after having a voice.
He said that a 'yes' result can be interpreted as a 'verification of our future.'
A meta-measure last Monday of the Macedonia Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters are going to be involved in public detoxification — something that is less than the necessary number.
Another meaning measurement of the Telma TV channel in Macedonia showed that 57 percent of voters plan to operate on Sunday.
Of these, the canal said that 70 percent would say yes.
For people to close their voice, at least 50 percent voice, plus one voice.
If public detours were not closed, it could damage the policy of the left-wing government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton defense and scorar
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling vraka Brighton defense led to 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday in the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scora for 65 minutes.
The Argentinian tip accepted a midway pass at the beginning of the sequence.
He passed three Brighton defense players and reached open ground.
Suddenly, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender, before he jumped past several others on the edge of the Brighton punishment field.
He got past a pass on the left and found Sterling.
The English tip used its first kick in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton Keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot straight into the right end of the target.
«Aguero still to work with the feet,» said City coach Pep Guardiola to report.
“We talked about him playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scora when he did.\"
But it was Sterling who gave them the sky blue the first advantage of the Premier League game.
That target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep into Brighton territory.
He kicks the ball beautifully along the left end of the course to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball while he led Sterling towards the target.
The sky blue tip kicks the ball into the field just before he slips out of the path.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League phase at 12:55 pm on Tuesday in Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play coils against Rockies in American baseball
With Nationals eliminated from Playoff content, there was no reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has a high sense of competition and hopes to take the \"mound\" on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to playoff for Rockies, who hires one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies watered at least 5-2 against the National's Friday night, but looks forward to closing the First Division title.
Even if we're not playing for anything, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team most likely playing at the highest level so far this year.
Who will not play with such conditions?’
There is still some uncertain woman who is going to start in Nationals on Sunday, but it may happen Scherzer is going \"pitche\".
Scherzer, who in that case starts for the 34th time, throw a 'volpen session' on Thursday and be 'pitche' normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, who comes from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 “strikeouts” in 220 2/3”innings this season.
Trump collects selectors in West Virginia
The president was obscuringly referring to his first election for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke of the importance of the republicans in the mid-term elections in the United States.
“All we’ve done so far is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I don't stand, but I run around everywhere to fight for the best candidates,\" he said.
Trump continued, \"You can see this terrible, terrible group of democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they have no idea that they're definitely going to take back power, you see how awful they are, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we shouldn't give it to them.\"
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to 'reject and block'.
'And you can see it based on the last four days,' he said, 'and call it the democrats 'not so bad and mean and dishonest'
He referred to Senator and Democratic Diane Feinstein, who caused his audience to bow.
“ Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who leaked documents?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I expect--it was really bad body language--the worst body language I've ever seen.\"
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They're intolerant to those who say what they mean
Since the Momentum activists in my local party were smoking to sensuate me, it wasn't surprising.
I'm the last one in a series of Labour-MPs that's been told I'm not welcome - just to see what I mean.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she protested against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for being out of touch with Jeremy Corbyn.
In terms of how important it is to run responsible economies, national security, Europe, and other similar themes that Jeremy ironically was indistinguishable with former tenants.
The call for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said, \"We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive.\"
In my last eight years as Labour MP, Friday night was exactly like this.
Unfortunately, today's meeting was not like that, and the promise of narrower policies is long ago forgotten if it was followed at all.
It has become more and more apparent that different viewpoints are not tolerated in Labour, and that every sentence is judged by the leaders of the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became a party leader, when colleagues I used to be politically united with a sudden expectation that I should change my mind and be united in things I would never agree with - whether it is about national security or the internal market in the European Union.
When I speak in public, it doesn't matter what I say, I always get my mouth shut on social media and people want me to go off while they're criticizing central politics and saying I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who are getting sex-discriminatory and racist gypsy facing themselves every day and who are still professional and do not leave.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time period is how normalized it has been to harass politicians.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should become more tolerant.
In fact, we are no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone; for every mistrust proposal and every change in the party rules, the party becomes narrower and narrower.
I've been getting a lot of advice in the last two years from people who have said I have to take it easy and not be so loud, so maybe people will \"like me better.\"
But that's not why I chose to join the policy.
When I reported into Labour, when I was still going on the school 32 years ago, it was because I was angry with Thatcher and how the government failed the country. My classroom was about to collapse, so I wanted better public services for those who need the most - if it was so as a councillor or a minister of government.
I have never hidden my political entities, nor in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East may have doubted what I stand for and what of the current leaders I don't agree with.
To those who vote for the motion on Friday, I can only say that when the country comes against a Brexit who wants to harm private, local businesses and public services, I don't understand why people care about wasting their energy asking questions about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But actually, I'm not the only message I've got fixed to Nottingham Momentum, but to the voters in the walrus, whether they're Labour-picks or not: I'm proud to be a tinker, and I promise no one can get me to go off or change my policy and prevent me from getting hot in the way I think is best for you all.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr peaks in Scottish rugby
Two late \"tries\" may change the result a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr was intending to win in this very entertaining Tennent's Championship game today.
They are now at the top of the pallet as the only invincible layer of a total of ten.
It was their sovereign defense and ability to take chances that gave their home team and coach, Peter Murchie, good reason to be naked.
\"We've been tested in the last few games, and we're still invincible, so I have to be content,\" he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, \"Ayr toner praise, they were better than us to take chance.\"
Grant Anderson had a try in 14 minutes, where Frazier Climo tried a conversion, like putting Ayr in front, but a yellow card from Scotland captain Rory Hughes from Warriors let Melrose gather, and Jason Baggot took an unconverted try.
Climo got a penalty just before the break, he scora and converted a 'solo try' to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the other half well and Patrick Anderson his \"try,\" which became converted by Baggot, reduced the spinning moon by five points.
There was a long break when Ruaridh Knott became seriously damaged and put on stretcher, and from the restart fauk Ayr forward through a Try from Stafford McDowall, such as Climo converted.
The effective captain of Ayr, Blair MacPherson, got a yellow card, and again Melrose tried an unconverted Bruce Colvine try, at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to deal with Climo without the ball from the punishment show, Scora MacPherson a Try.
Climo converted again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong his box kick and sent \"flanker\" Gregor Henry away from his home team his fifth \"try\".

«The sea is ours» Bolivia hopes the court will open the water road to the Pacific
Sailors patrol marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flag with sea blue flag.
Marine Bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazonaselva are covered with the motto: 'The sea is ours.
and the duty to return to it.\"
In the landlocked Bolivia, people can still remember a coastline lost to Chile, in a bloody conflict about resources in the 19th century, longing to sail back in the Pacific.
These hopes may be stronger than in many decades, while Bolivia waits for the international court sentence to arrive on October 1, after five years of deliberation.
'Bolivia has driven, peace of mind and is alone, and, of course, expects a positive result,' said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians come to look at the rulings of the International Court, hoping that the Hague Court will support Bolivia’s demands and that Chile - after decades of negotiation - gives Bolivia a distinct exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic-born president of Bolivia, who struggled to be elected again next year, has good reason to hope for a positive outcome.
“We will soon return to the Pacific,” he promised late August.
But some analysts don't think the court's going to let Bolivia get access to the ocean and that little would have changed even if they got access.
The Netherlands-based United Nations Court of Justice does not have the power to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia and has suggested that they will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
That the judgment of the court comes only six months after the last negotiations indicates that the case was 'not complicated,' said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
The last four years have far from Bolivia's cause, they've done the opposite.
“The problem of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration,” said Zárate.
Morales, with its combative rhetoric, has killed what was that of Chile's goodwill, meant Zárate.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue negotiations, but it would be extremely difficult to discuss the problem after that.
The two countries have not increased ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an extraordinary opportunity to open up new relations with Chile and a chance to 'set lines at 139 years of inequity and instead benefit both,' he said.
Calzadilla also rejected Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, using this maritime problem to win voices.
‘Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific,’ he added.
'Doom is a possibility to see what we need to do to forget the past.'
North Korea says they won't remove nuclear weapons if they can't trust the United States of America
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says that his nation cannot be the first to abolish, unless they can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to follow up on the lift they gave during the Singapore meeting between the American and North Korean leaders.
Rising its comments comes at a time when the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pomepo, seems to want to start over his locked nuclear diplomat, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the United States has a false hope that North Korea will be in subjection if the United States continues with sanctions and resists any declaration of the end of the Korean war.
Washington is refusing to agree to any declaration of the end of the war without Pyongyang ending first.
Kim and the president of the United States, Donald Trump, both want to hold a new meeting.
But many people are critical that Pyongyang is serious when it comes to the degradation and that the country most likely sees its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plan to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows that massive headaches are the last fashion on the way to a shopping street near you.
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, you don't need to look anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have exposed a series of large and special headpieces in their SS19 collection.
Highly impractical hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creations right on the catwalk.
The most magnificent garment was a lavish, beige Valentino hat with a feather-like, at the brim that covered its models' head.
There's another oversized addition to the fashion show, including a jeweled vasemelon, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple, but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of bizarre masks - just in time before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips sewn together and the like more on Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, complete with the loop and mask, while another looked like a melted ice in the biscuits.
If you like this tremendously dramatic fashion, you can only look forward to it.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hats come to the floor of a shopping street near you.
The oversized hats come right after the \"La Bomba\", the straw hat with the 60 cm wide beam that has been seen on celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratakowski.
The cool brand behind the highest impractical hat, which was all over the social media, has now sent a new creation out on the catwalk - a grey beach bag of the same size as the bikini-clad model that carried her.
The beach bag, with the color of the burnt orange and frits top with a white leather handle, was the most iauge-falling part of Jacquemus's La Riviera SS19 collection during the fashion week in Paris.
Kändis-stylist Luke Armitage commented to FEEMAIL: \"I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the fashion shops next summer - the designer has made such a big impression that I doubt that it is possible to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.\"
John Edward: Global citizens need language skills
Private schools in Scotland are known for being at high academic level, and this will continue in 2018 with excellent exam results, which will only be enhanced by individual and common success in sports, art, music and other social activities.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Skular (SCIS), are working to provide the best services for their students and their parents.
The aim of self - discipline is to prepare its students for further and higher education, career careers and role as global citizens.
As an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a tailor-made curriculum, we see modern languages as popular choice in the schools.
Nelson Mandela said, \"If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, then his heart will be humbled.\"
This is an important reminder that we cannot just sit down in English when we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries.
By looking at the results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the ligatables, with the highest characters for independent sketches.
A total of 68 percent of French students received A.
The data collected from the SCIS 74 member schools show that 72 percent of the students received A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who took German, 69 percent of those who took French, and 63 percent of those who took Spanish also got A.
This shows that independent gossip in Scotland supports out - of - date speech as vital qualities, which children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Languages such as choice are considered equivalent to STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum to independent sketches and other places.
A survey by the UK Adding and Properties Selection in 2014 showed that 17 percent of employers were unable to fill the settings due to a lack of language skills in the applicants.
Thus, language is increasingly important in order to prepare youth for working life.
With several job opportunities for language scholars, these properties are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career a youth may have, if they have learned a second language, they have a proper advantage in the future with such a property.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a advantage in a competitive world.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adult British in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any other language than English well enough to hold a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percent, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language training for our children.
Learning more languages, especially those used in developing countries, may give children a better chance to find good jobs in the future.
In Scotland every language is different from the language in which they teach.
Many glare focus on classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are classified as important in Britain when we look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Regardless of what your child is interested in, there will always be a lot of language to choose from in self - discipline, and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scots of self-involvement are dedicated and want to create a learning environment that will prepare children and provide the properties they need to be closed, regardless of what the future holds.
It cannot be denied that in this global, business-oriented environment, language is vital for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be referred to as \"international communication properties\".
Self-centered skates will continue to offer this choice and thus offer a lack of and high competence for Scotland's young.
I faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council for Independent Skoles
LeBron debuts in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is soon to meet fans who look forward to watching LeBron James debut on the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the pre-song game on Sunday, against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how long to play has not been determined yet.
“It’s going to be more than a minute and less than 49,” announced Walton on Laker’s official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, is telling us that James is most likely to play a limited amount of time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' schedule for the season.
'I don't need preson games at this stage of career to get me ready,' he said.
Trumps West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump starts on a whirlwind of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five planned stops the coming week, including stops at friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation voice pending to choose to fill the Supreme Court's vacant position, Trump aims to build support for future mid-term elections because the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the Congress when voting is due in November.
How long will Trump be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you view it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can view the Trump West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably bring up this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh, who was excited about sexual abuse, with an expected confirmatory voice from the Senate waiting for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the primary goal of this vault of collections is to help the Republicans to meet the November elections and get some momentum (driving force).
So, President Trump's campaign says that next week these five collections are entitled to 'reject volunteers and adherents which the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives', according to Reuters.
'Control of Congress is so critical of his agenda that the president will rise to as many states as possible when we enter the busy campaign season,' explains a spokesman for the Trump campaign who refused to be informed to Reuters.
Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the collection for the evening can be supported by \"Ohio and Pennsylvania and take coverage from the Pittsburgh media\", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who's been asked for in the metastasis measurements.
'It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come and try to give him a boost in the meaning measurements,' said Simon Haeder, a political researcher at West Virginia University, following Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows the stomach for fighting to keep hope alive on singles on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes could only be like this Ryder Cup.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a completely turbulent sport attack, but one that the players really believe in and never more than on competitions like these.
So where would they say that momentum is now?
'They had a six-point lease, and now there's four, so we take it as a little moment, I guess,' said Jordan Spieth walking off for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, know that they have a little wind in their sails, and they have a lot to be encouraged by, not least the kind of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each one has three points from four.
Spieth has our mortal physician from tea to green and he's looking for examples.
The gutural screams of the celebration were higher as his round continued, seeking an important putt to take the match four all-quao.re when he and Thomas had been two down by two.
His putt who won the 15th game was met with a similar scream, the kind that tells you that he means that the American team is not out of it.
“You have actually only had to dig deeply and worry about your own fight,” said Spieh.
There are already each of these players left.
18 holes to form a emblem.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the invincible story of Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange, but sweet couples are four from four and can't do anything wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who would not shoot a bow on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine (the last nine holes on a course of 18 holes) on Friday morning.
That race, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this noisy, dedicated audience, is focusing on them being the players who are going to fight on Sunday, and there would be no more popular players to seal a potential European say when the sun goes down over Le Golf National, than the Fleetwood or Molinari.
I'd rather both at the same time in different holes.
Talking about European honour will still be too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did short work by Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning when he was married to Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the first nine, rough Spanish and Swedish into a hole they never came close to climbing out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to look closely at because of the interaction between opponents, advice they give, and advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in an eye.
Europe has played better than a team so far and takes a significant rent into the last day, but this foursome session also showed that the Team United States has the stomach for the fight that someone, especially Stateside, had doubt on.
Europe takes 10-6 rentals in the Ryder Cup Final
Europe wants a healthy advantage into the last day of Ryder Cup after coming out of laurday's four-balls and four-some matches with a 10-6 lead across the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari rented the charge with two wins over a companion Tiger Woods to take their game so far on Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European page took care of the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a mistful American side tomorrow for four-balls, and took the 3-1 series.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes and won two fights, but they couldn't get in the bottom row.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from the 12 single games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points while he and Molinari called “Molwood” after a startling weekend, is only the second couple who win four points from their openings in four games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in four-balls, they went out so great to beat a layman Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more intrusive 5 and 4.
Woods, who ran through two games on Saturday, showed the sporadic brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four ball and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who suffered for the morning Four Balls, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 and 1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe still didn't get everything they wanted on a decent, winded day southwest of Paris.
Three times the size of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas make a two-point reference to the Americans on Saturday.
They won a brave 2 & 1 says over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-balls and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in the foursomes when they had lost the two holes in the open.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a layer come back from a four-point base and entered single, although as holders, Furyk's side only needs to draw to keep the trophy.
After two days of being the second best, it still seems that a Sunday counterattack will be outside of them.
North Korea says there isn't any talk of arming down one side without trust
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations that if sanctions continue, the mistrust of the United States will continue to grow, and that the country would by no means give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of World Powers that North Korea had made “significant measures” to improve the situation in the past year, for example, they have stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and do not promise to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
'We are still not getting anything similar back from the United States,' he said.
\"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first.\"
While Ri, a famous North Korean, has made several complaints about Washington’s resistance to a ‘phase’ approach to the abolition of nuclear weapons, where North Korea would be rewarded for gradual action, the questioners showed significantly that he did not reject unilateral nuclear destruction, as Pyongyang has done earlier.
Ri referred to a common question issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit ever between a seated American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work for the \"reduction of nuclear power on the Korean Peninsula\" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions in North Korea.
‘USA insists on ‘reduction of nuclear power first’ and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose of coercion, and even resisted ‘the declaration of peace’, Ri said.
\"Believing that sanctions can break us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that when the penalties continue, our distrust will be only greater.\"
Never mind the plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. president highlighted in the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister weighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, in the last five months and added: \"If the party to this nuclear disarmament challenge was South Korea, and not the United States, the Korean Peninsula would not have stopped the way it has done.\"
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the F.N. General Assembly that it was not possible to stop North Korean rockets against the American mainland, after evil President Trump called Kim a rocket man on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work still had to be done and that sanctions had to remain in place for North Korea to phase out its nuclear weapon.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not have a time frame for this, saying: “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia claim that the F.N. Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the actions that have been taken.
But the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told the F.N.'s Security Council on Thursday that: \"The operations of the Security Council still have to be maintained vigorously and without failure until we get the complete, final, verified liquidation of the nuclear weapons.\"
The Security Council has unilaterally increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to give way to Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the F.N. General Assembly and then said that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip was not going well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, but a few hours later, North Korea condemns him to come up with “ gangway-like demands.”
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to disassemble a missile city and also an atomic complex if the United States of America did \"equivalent measures\".
He said that Kim had told him that the \"consistent measures\" he applied for were guarantee guarantees as Trump promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalizing his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are getting enough sleep.
This year, a new Harvard University course has helped all students to get more sleep in an effort to fight the growing macho culture that is studying in caffeine all night. It means using caffeine to stay awake all night to study.
One academic found that students at the university often have little attention when it comes to the most basic - how to take care of yourself.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of his battles in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after discussing the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
“At the end of it a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I told this now, at an adult’s age?’
She said that no one had ever told her the importance of sleeping - something that surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, roll out for the first time this year, explains what is important for how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improves their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the health services of the university, said that the university decided to introduce the course after the students got seriously worse sleep during the week.
The hourly course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dormitory, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches, and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term lack of sleep may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know it won't change the behavior of students right away.
But we think they have the right to know-- just as you have the right to know, the health effects by choosing to smoke cigarettes, added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride over 24 hours still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that sleep shortages are a growing problem.
Making sure that you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even avoided weight gain, since lack of sleep puts the brain in the starving mode and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after he had been a student last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eye and inspired him to press for a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before they start in the prestigious institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when going to bed, and also for waking up, and being aware of the harmful effects of blue light coming from electronic screens and LED lighting, which can convert the inner clock in total, resulting in problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga-target gives Gerrard's men downhill
Rangers went on a new defeat on the road when Dolly Menga's post sent Steven Gerrard's outside page to a 1-los loss on Livingston.
The Ibrox page was on the lookout to take its first sayer on the road side 4-1-trium on St. Johnstone in February, but made for Gary Holt only the second defeat of Gerrard on 18 games of rent, and gave eight points, a round during Ladbroke's rent by the Premier League, Hearts.
Menga beat to seven minutes before half-time, and a Ranger setup with missing inspiration never seemed to equalize.
While Rangers now fall down to the sixth place, Livingston climbs to the third and lies just behind the Hibernian on target.
And there may be additional problems in the ranger storage after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a sore in the head, after an object appeared to be thrown from the far side.
Gerrard made eight changes on the team that swept Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinalane.
Holt, on the other hand, went with Livy 11 who took a point with a drink shot last week, and he would have been excited about the way that his well-known outfit took the quail roof on his opponents every quarter shift.
Rangers might have had the ball the most, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scora after just two minutes, when Menga's first post sent Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's target, but the midwayer failed in his giant charm.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense party, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot far on the retreat.
Rangers took control, but it seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third round.
Alfredo Morellos decided that he would have been punished at 20 meters when he and Steven Lawless crashed, but he judges Steven Thomson wave away his wish to the Colombian.
Rangers made only two shots on target in the first half, but former Ibrox goalie Liam Kelly was hardly concerned by Lassana Coulibaly's head and a silent shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the rules of the game, no one can deny it because they told it only because of the shot.
Again, Rangers failed to handle a deep death ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher beat the ball to Scott Robinson, who was doing great for picking out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard was acting like he switched Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and switched an instant effect when the wingman created a hatch for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly race ahead to block.
But Livingstone continues to outdone the guest team to play exactly what game they liked, with the fact that Lithgow and Halkett forward long shot.
Holt's team could have increased their rent by the end, but McGregor was very happy to stop Jacobs from doing so, until Lithgrow put a long post from the corner mark.
The reserve for Ranger, Glenn Middleton, had a new claim for punishment when he supported Jacobs, but again Thomson ignored it.
Almanac: Inventor of the geiger
And now one page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE REKNER ... the day the physicist Johannes Wilhelm 'Hans' Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger enumerator.
As a scientific carrier all the way back then, the Geiger drug dealer was also a pop culture carrier, as in the 1950 Bells of Coronado film, with the seemingly unsuspectingly lazy cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: \"Was it in all the world?\"
Rogers: \"It's a Geiger counter, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you turn these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms produced by the radioactivity of the minerals.»
Evans: \"Yes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
\"His\" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that asks his name lives on.

New cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to \"see\" red cells and kill them.
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise red cells, as part of the treatment

A sample vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vasin, who teaches the immune system to recognise red cells, experienced the ovarian cancer passing for more than 18 months.
This method involves withdrawing immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory, so that they can \"see\" a protein that is common in many cancers called HER2, and then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: \"Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.\"
HER2 «Encourage the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and teaching how to target cancer cells has worked when treating a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West starts a Pro-Trump-Ditribe, wearing a MAGA hat, after he visits the TV show Saturday Night Live.
Sorry, I didn't go too well.
Kanye West was excitable in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an unlikely performance in which he praised the U.S. president, Donald Trump, and said he was going to stand for election in 2020.
After taking his third song for the night, called Ghost Town, where he was wearing a Make America Great caps, he gave the Democrats a tiger and repeated his support to Trump.
'So many times I speak to a white person, and they say, 'How could you like Trump, he's racist?'
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a number along with the comedian Matt Damon, where Hollywood stars ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate judicial committee on the debt of sexual abuse from Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not sent, the recording to West's Tirad was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to mock West with the article.
Vest had also complained to the audience that he had a difficult backstage because of his main garment.
\"You bully me behind the scene.
They said, don't go out there with that hat on.
They're harassing me!
And then they say I'm in a sunken place,\" he said, according to Washington Examinor.
West continued: 'Do you want to see the sunken place?' says he would 'take on the superman caps, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love.\"
His comments led to exhaling at least twice from the audience, and the SNL cast members seemed embarrassingly affected, reported Variety, with a person who told the publication: “Heil studio was deathless.”
West was picked up as a late substitute for singer Ariana Grande, when her former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confuses many with a performance of the song in Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the Conservative Group of TPUSA, Candice Turner as a twittra: \"To one of the most courageous spirits: TAKING TO AGAINST THE PUBLE.\"
But talkshow-vertin Karen Hunter twittra that West \"just seemed to be the way he is, and it's absolutely amazing.\"
“But I didn’t choose to pay anyone (by buying his music or dress or supporting his “art”) which I believe embraces and pours out ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We are also » let go.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said he was now \"formally known as Kanye West\".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Medrappar, Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and of course the last music player Prince, changed the name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince.

The Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington goes out against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his sword-throwing role as Jon Snow in HBO's powerful medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has gone out on the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen often lead young guys to feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he means something has gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones player Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he knows \"very strong\" to raise the problem.
'Personally, I'm convinced that something has gone wrong with the masculinity.' he said.
\"What have we taught men when they grow up, when does the problem we see now?\"
Kit means that TV is partly responsible for the addition of toxic masculinity because of very human characters.
He continues, 'What is inborn and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, which makes young guys feel that they have to be this unique side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions today - how do we change it?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.'
In the interview he also admitted that he would not do Game of Thrones runner or follow-up at the end of the series this summer, saying he is “completed with battlefields and horses”.
From November, Kit will play in a new recording of Sam Shepards True West, who is the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is an ass.
The actor recently revealed that he is watching the meeting with his wife Rose to be the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
\"I met my wife in this show, so it gave me my future family and my life on,\" he said.
Rose played Ygrite, the achievements of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by the country’s health.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new occurrences were transmitted through six, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV rapidly spread through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the amount of people who got HIV this way was reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health care professionals at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, from year to year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminated in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/HBTQs is claimed to be widespread.
Because of the conservative values in the country, students have asserted that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of pathogens come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has allowed universal access to HIV medicine as part of an attempt to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to add leaky information from the GOP Senator, it explodes in 'hazardous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
United States Rep. Maxine Waers condemned on Saturday claims that a member of her staff had disclosed personal information about three Republican American senators on Wikipedia pages to the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrats claimed that claims were pedalled by extreme-right searches and web pages.
\"Liars, liars and more contemptible lies\" said Waters in a Twitter question.
The published information included informed home addresses and phone numbers for the Americans Sens. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing about sexual assaults against the Supreme Court-elected Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came once after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the article was linked to Waters' office and published the information to a member of Waters' staff, reported Hill.
“This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie,” continues Waters.
\"One of my appendices - who has received his identity, personal information and security compromised as a result of these false and false claims - was by no means responsible for the leak of this information.
This false claim is a false and an absolute lie.\"
The question to Water quickly got criticism on the Internet, among other things from former press secretary in the White House, Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is angry,” wrote Fleischer.
'This suggests that she does not have the temper to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is blamed for something they didn't do, they don't have to be angry.
They don't have to be tough.
They don't have to ask questions about the motive of the debt.
They must be calm and peaceful.\"
Fleischer turned out to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Kavanaugh, who was blamed by critics for seeming angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tries to take over Waters' place in the mid-term election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
\"Great if it's true\", tweet him.
In his question, Waters said that her office had notified “the right government and the law enforcement entities of these false claims.
\"We will see to it that the perpetrators are exposed,\" she continues, \"and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to every one of my associates.\"
Johnny English strikes again - spy shit by weak Rowan Atkinson
It's traditional to look for Brexit-markables in all new films with a British angle, and it works for this revitalization of Johnny England's action-comed spoof-franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the self-ironic satire that deals with how open-minded we are become the new exportability of the country?
In any case, the large, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has for the second time been given his permission to fuck things up - his name signals more than anything else that he is a wide comedian of cinematics in non-English-language countries.
Of course, he's the stupid, secret agent who despite his bizarres wants to spread a little glamour has got a little bit of Clouseau, a dash by Mr Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes a simple tune to the Fire Cars, the theme of the Olympic Opens ceremony in London 2012.
He is also original based on the rising and international mysterious man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard ads, which left chaos behind.
There's one or two pretty eyes in this last JE escape.
I love Johnny English, who approaches a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armory suit while the rotor blades strike his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy is on the screen, but the humor feels quite swung and strangely redundant, especially since \"serious\" movie brands such as 007 and Mission Imposible themselves now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The sense of humor is that he's right on children instead of awake, and to me Johnny England's noisy accident is not so inventive and focused as Atkinson's replicable nonsense in the person in Bean.
The current permanent situation is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the United Kingdom's super secret web network of spies, who reveal the identities of all British agents in the area, to the horror of the agent at work - a unfortunately little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and war hero figure, who already has a complete breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing his very best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but there's not much in the script to work with.
Her informant informs her that when every single active spy has been owed, she has to bring in someone who is retired.
And that means the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works as a teacher of a somewhat elegant aesthetic, but provides unofficial lessons on how to work undercover: a couple of nice jokes here, since English offers a School of Rock-type Academy for espionage.
English is sent back to Whitehall for a nad situation-briefing and reintroduced with his former understanding assistant Bough, replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moving over to a submarine driver's job, an overentuistical role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin's ability to make things look terrible in Hernar Majesty's Secret Services is back too much in the meeting with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful five fatal, Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the prime minister has a dangerous fall under the enchantment of the charismatic technology of the billionaire, who claims that he can solve Britain's computer problems: the nasty Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of farse-like game: disguised as waiters, put them fire on a fine French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggle themselves on board Volta's yacht; and English trigger pure pineapple as he tries to use a Virtual Reality kit to make himself known to the inside of Volta's house.
I'm sure all the stops have been pulled out to the last sequence, but as lovely and unexplored as they are, there's quite a lot of child TV all over the place.
Pretty moderate stuff.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help thinking: Can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
Labour Party Labour denied that they are drawing up a plan for the English to work a four-day week, but being paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is now considering a radical plan that wants the British to work a four-day week - but gets paid for five.
According to the report, managers will pass on savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
Then added could enjoy a three-day weekend - but still get the same pay.
Sources said the idea would 'pass' with the economic agenda of the party and plan to increase benefits for workers.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changed economy.
An older Labour source told The Sunday Times: A policy message is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It doesn't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a wish that fits into the approach the party has to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker, as well as superior to the party's industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its 2017 election campaign.
The ambition is currently not accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: 'A four-day working week is not party policy and it is not assessed by the party.'
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell used last week's work conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to withdraw power from \"unsightly directors\" and \"professors\" in rich businesses.
The plans of the shadow chancer also mean that current water actionaries cannot regain their entire efforts when a Labour Government could make “reduction” because of perceived mistreatment.
He has also confirmed plans to put employees in corporate boards and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds (including ownership fund) to provide 10 percent of the equity in the private sector with contributions, which would receive annual dividends of up to £500, about $5,000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, story in the 60 Minutes program about the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could get them to change their tanks.
The FBI investigation into complaints against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and it raises the question of how far the Bureau could influence some Republican senators to draw their support.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley of 60 Minutes asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would change their mind.
Kennedy seems more open than his partner from South Carolina.
'I mean, of course,' said Kennedy.
\"I said on my way into the earring, I said, 'I have spoken to judges Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that claim came out and said, 'Have you done it?'
He was determined, determined, unknowing.
Graham's voice, however, seemed in stone.
\"I have made up my agreement on Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite charge to change me,\" he said.
'Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it, 'just Graham to, and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
'And all her names could not verify it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes.'
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday is New York’s host for the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a tremendously impressive display of stars and an equally impressive mission; ending poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to Central Park’s large lawn, not only to enjoy watching Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes perform, but also to increase the awareness of the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concerters had to complete a series of tasks, or “actions” as volunteer work; send e-mail to a world leader, call a phone call or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizens been with 12 years left to achieve their goal?
Is the idea of paying people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of \"clicktivism\" - people feel that they make a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen states that more than 19 million “actions” have been registered from its supporters, and have participated in and pressed on a number of different goals.
It is said that these operations have contributed to the announcement by world leaders of commitments and policies of more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group showed 390 commitments and announcements as a result of their operations, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the safe midlane have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important obligations are The Power of Nutrition, a British-based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs who are obliged to “help children reach their full potential”; promises to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from global citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after taking more than 5,000 actions to require Britain to become better at nutrition for mothers and children, the British government announced funding for a project called The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition treatment.
In response to one of the usual questions on the website, they ask 'What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?'
Global Citizens replied: \"It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid pipes lead us, we'll be happy because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the actors who perform this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Fladen as a block to prevent Russian energy exports - interior secretary
Washington can ‘if necessary’ resort to his fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, as quoted by Washington Examiner, International Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a step forward in exploring new energy markets.
'I believe that they are in the Middle East because they want to pass on energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe,' he says.
And follow the official, there are ways and means to take it.
'The U.S. has this river, with our Fleet, to make sure that the highways are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not go to the market,' he said.
Zinke spoke to participants in the event organised by Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group to present itself as the ‘voice to the energy consumer’ in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to managing Russia and Iran, and noted that they were actually the same.
“The economic solution to Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuel,” he said, while referring to Russia as a ‘one-trick pony’ with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations come as the Trump Administration has been on the mission to increase the export of LNG to Europe and to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In connection with this, officials in the Trump Administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the ‘inadaptive’ North Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump made Berlin Moscow’s ‘captive’.
Moscow has repeatedly underlined that the Nord Stream 2 pipe rental, which is redoubled the existing pipe leading capacity of 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's keen opposition to the project is driven only by economic causes and is a judge of unfair competition.
'I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and consumers' choice of suppliers,' said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. holding has resigned from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial, German, and German Industries Association (BDI) has encouraged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
'I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,' said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will 'buy hard' to make Presidential candidate in 2020, the Massachusetts Senator
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she was going to take a 'substantial look' to put as Presidential candidate after the mid-term election.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running as a candidate.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our bad government, and it includes a woman on top,” she follows The Hill.
'After 6 November, I will carefully consider setting up a presidential candidate.'
Warren entered President Donald Trump at the council meeting and said that he 'is taking this country in the wrong direction'.
\"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,\" she said.
Warren has been hugging his criticism of Trump and his high-ranking Brett Kavanaugh.
On a tweet Friday, Warren said 'of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.'
However, a health measurement published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe that it should stand out as a candidate in 2020.
51 percent of Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not be a candidate, follow the Suffolk University Political Research Centre/ Boston Globe investigation.
Thirty-two percent supported such a candidate.
The study showed more support for a round of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other highly profiled democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidate, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd decide officially in January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin's PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) at Donald Trump collection
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after serving in September.
He was arrested and charged with an election event in the home on Monday night.
“Wow my own son goes through, what he goes through when he comes back, allows me to relate to other relatives who are marked by PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers return with,” she said to the audience at a collection for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest \"the elephant in the room\" and said of his son and other war veterans that \"they come back a little different, they come back hard, they come back, they come back and they wonder if respect for what they and cosol data and pilots and all the other military, have done for the country, exists\".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was responsible for physical power in the home against a woman, for disrupting a report on power in the world and the preservation of a weapon while he was under threat, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge to new asylum policies
Athens states and districts of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denied asylum to victims who run from government or government in the world.
Representatives from the 18 states and districts submitted a friend-by-law card Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker in favour of politics, reported NBC News.
The defendant's full name in Grace v. Sessions is suitable for the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Freedom Union) archived in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said that her partner \"and the elected gang members\" abused her, but American officials refused her request for asylum on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the State that support Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who produce a large amount of U.S. asylum seekers, who are faced with widespread gang and power problems in the world.
The new US asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision from immigration laws, which allowed illegal immigrants as refugees from the home to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia Minister of Justice Karl Racine said in a question on Friday that the new policy “is overcoming many decades of national, federal and international law.”
«Federal law requires all asylum cases to be condemned for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an obstacle is contrary to this principle,» said friend-of-court short.
Lawyers further asserted in summary that policy that refuses access damages the US economy and say it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and \"provide necessary work\".
Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to give asylum to victims of refugee abuse and gang power in June.
‘Asyl is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social or political group,’ said Sessions of 11 June in their policy announcement.
Asylum was never meant to relieve all problems - even all serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue work in Palu while the death number doublest in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation became more and more serious.
“It feels very tense,” said 35 years old mother, Risa Kusuma, who trampled his feverish baby son at an evacuation center in the broken city, Palu.
‘At every minute ambulances come with bodies.
Clean water is hard to find.\"
People are observed on their way back to their broken worlds, searching through damaged property and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospital destroyed by the earthquake, with a strength of 7.5, was overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken his back and shoulder, suffered outside of the Palu's Military Hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to still strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eye as he told him that he knew the severe earthquake shook the hotel room he shared with his wife and her daughter on the fifth floor.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the rubble of the wall, I believe, “pronounced Haris to Associated Press, and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife crying for help, but then it kept quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.\"
US Ambassador owes China for bullying with 'propaganda adverts'
One week after an official Chinese newspaper was running a 4-page commercial in an American daily newspaper, highlighting the mutual benefits of trade with the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador against China Beijing owed to use the American press to spread propaganda.
The United States President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to China Daily's payoff in the Des Moines registry - the state of Iowa's largest salsavis - after having owed China to try to interfere in the US Congressional elections on November 6, a debt China denied.
Trump's debt that Beijing was trying to interfere in American elections marked what American officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign of Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an increasing trade war that has seen them in turns increasing taxes on each other’s imports.
China’s return tariffs early in the trade war were designed to match exporters in states such as Iowa who supported Trump’s Republican party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former long-standing governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had injured American workers, farmers and farms.
“China,” wrote Branstad in a section of the Sunday Des Moines register, “doblar no bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In its dissemination of propaganda, the Chinese government benefits from America’s dear tradition of freedom of expression and free press by submitting a paid ad in the Des Moines register,” wrote Branstad.
'In contrast, by the newspaper down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited differing voices and will see no true reflection of the various points that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic path, giving that the media is below the fixed thumb of the Chinese Communist Party 'creeding him.
He added that “one of China’s most progressive newspapers turned off the offer to publish — his article, even if he didn’t say what a newspaper.
Republicans disembark female voters during the midterm with Kavanaugh Debacle, keeping analysts.
Since many top republicans are stand-by and defend the highest-ranking Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple debt of sexual abuse, the analyst has warned that they will probably see a backlash, strangely from women, in the coming mid-term choices.
The sensibilities around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have registered that they already wanted to proceed with a vote.
These things cannot be undone; Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, says to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute impression for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
'Women aren't going to forget what happened yesterday - they're not going to forget it tomorrow, and not in November,' said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman of the progressive group MoveOn on Friday. Washington, DC newspaper.
On Friday morning the Protestant songs “November Come!” while they protested in the hall of the Senate when the Republicans, who run the court committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
'Democratic enthusiasm and motivation come to be outside the diagram,' said Stu Rothenberg, a non-participative political analyst, to the news side.
\"People say that it has already been high, that it is true.
But it can be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds, who, while they don't like the president, often don't vote.\"
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which in detail indicated the allegations of sexual abuse by the Supreme Court Nominated, analysts suggested that a setback could follow if the Republicans pressed forward with confirmation.
'This has become a confused root of the GOP,' said Michael Steele, former leader of the Republican National Committee, early in the previous week, following the NBC News.
“It’s not just about how the Committee has been held or whether Kavanaugh has been seen on the bench, it’s also about how Republicans have dealt with it and how they have dealt with it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities, a group that helps to select Democrats, pointing to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be a little bit divided over who they're going to trust in the cold water of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little bit more sidings with the latter.
A new meaning measurement from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent believed that Kavanaugh probably lied under his witness, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, and, besides, at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified to the C.E.C.C. to the Senate under the jurisdiction of last week that Kavanaugh completely assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominated her sexual organs while they attended a party during their studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web Plans to start a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launchs a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project for technology students, Inrupt, is a company built by Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid lets users select where data is stored and which people can access which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt is 'world domination'.
'We have to do it now,' he said about the start.
\"It's a historical moment.\"
The app uses Solids technology to allow people to create their own \"personal online data storage\" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, memo lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a web browser and everyone at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online store is that it is completely up to the user who can access all kinds of information.
The company calls it \"personal authority through data\".
The Idea of Inrupt, following the Managing Director of John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, processes and appropriate ability to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a insurance platform purchased by IBM and some added developers with contracts to work on the project, as well as a community of volunteers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about not making a complete change, where all their business models are completely turned on head all night.
We do not ask for their permission.
In a medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based network collection.
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute for Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been a voice with great influence in the debate on network neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
‘I’m unlikely optimistic about this next epoch online,’ la Berners-Lee ten l.
Bernard Water: WW1 Victoria Cross Divine Feira
The deity of the only English church who won a Victoria cross during the first world war as a fighter has been fair in its hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Pastor Bernard Vann won the prize on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
Nevertheless, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial was unveiled by his two grandchildren on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was \"brilyant symbol\", that the stone would be unveiled just 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning performance.
According to London Gazette, Lt Col Vann employed her battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918 “through a very thick shovel and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns.”
He then ran up to the front line, and with the greatest galantery, he led the line forward before bringing a field gun forward and beating out three of the group.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's operations were \"whatever I know I could never live up to, but something I'm adamant to.\"
He and his brother Dr James Vann also put a wreath after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was very proud to play a role in the parade, and added that \"the value of a real hero is shown by the support given by many people.\"
The MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, they got Peppa Gris instead.
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see a package called Bellator 206, and you won't see the main event.
The report from San Jose contained 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown live through the night in Britain on channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just in Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald, viewers in Britain were again sedated when the coverage changed to Peppa Gris.
Some were hardly impressed after they had stayed awake to the early hours especially for the battle.
A fan on Twitter stole a switch to the comic book for the children as a \"some kind of sick joke.\"
“It’s public regulation that at 6 a.m. if the inside was not owned like that, they had to switch to the program for the children,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communication, when asked for the transfer.
The Peppa pig, yes.
Bellator corporate president Scott Coker said they're going to work on planning to include British viewers in the future.
'I think when I think about replay, I think we can figure it out,' said Coker.
\"But it is six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday, and we can't figure this out before Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when it went over, there were many lyrics going back and forth, and everyone wasn't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, next time it won't happen.
We keep it to five fights instead of six -- as we usually do -- and we tried to deliver to the fans, and we just went over.
It is a bad situation.\"
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley known himself “underlying” because of sexuality
The Olympic stupor Tom Daley says that in growing up he felt worse than everyone because of his sexuality - but he gave the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went on to go on saying that \"not all are like me.\"
As he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island disks presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others hope.
He also said to become a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular reporter in the cross section show, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off because of illness.
What might look like a loss in the first Laverne program, Daly said he knew himself \"less than\" anyone else who grew up because \"it was not socially acceptable to like guys and girls\".
He said, \"To this day, the feeling of being less than and feeling different is the real thing that has given me the power and the strength to rejoice.\"
He wanted to prove that he was \"noko\", he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-gong bronze Olympic medallion has become a professional LGBT campaign and used its appearance at this year's Common Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decrime homosexuality.
He said that he spoke out because he knew himself lucky to live without any distinction and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - \"surprising me.\"
Daley married Oscar's winner, 20 years older than he was last year, but he said the age difference never had a problem.
\"When you go through so much at such a young age\" - he went to his first Olympic 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone the same age who had experienced similar heights and downs.
The couple were parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Dayy, and Daley said his whole perspective had changed.
\"If you'd asked me last year, he said, \"all I have to do is win a gold medal.\"
“You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Mi Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie.\"
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his dad didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he'd asked about was if they had tickets to London in 2012 - when he wanted to be on the first row.
'I couldn't tell him that you're not going to be in the front row,' he said.
\"I held my hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally admitted he wasn't invincible,\" he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the Olympics in 2012 and water bronze.
\"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - to dive in over a home publication on an Olympic game, where fans didn't feel any better,\" he said.
It also inspired his first song - Pride of Heather Small - that had vibrated with him in the building to the Olympics and still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape his Mickelson on the bench on Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson wants to set a record on Sunday when he's playing his 47 Ryder Cup game, but he has to turn around to avoid it being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event of a record 12th time, was seen on the bench of Captain Jim Furyk in front of Saturday's golf game in four-balls and four-somes.
Instead of being in the middle of the operation, which he has often been for the United States, the five-time big winner splits his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game within the range of the hope of correcting what he does.
Never most competent long-coders. Not even on top of his career, the 48-year-old is the best to match with the long-coded on the tronge, French main course, where balls hit outside if the golf player is not exactly hit.
And if the path itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson meets in the ninth fight Sunday, the exact British Open Master Francesco Molinari, who has joined up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their fights this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 single matches, get to a hot start, Mickelson's game can be absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
“He fully understood his role today, gave me a pat on his back, and put his arm around me, and said that he would be ready tomorrow,” said Furyk.
“He has great confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer, and he's added so much to these layers in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he was playing two games.
I pictured more, but that's how it was, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He will be out there just like everyone else.\"
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup games being played on Sunday.
This can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven halfs, although Furyk said that his proximity caused some intangible properties to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, entertaining, likes to have fun with people, and he’s a good guy to have in the courtroom,” he explained.
'I think the younger players had fun getting along with him too, this week that was fun to see.
He contributes much more than just playing.’
Europe Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great rent can soon disappear
From experience, Thomas Bjørn, the European Captain, knows that a significant lease on the way into the last few days' singles of the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an unpleasant ride.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a side captain of Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came across the finish line with the nose leading with the narrowest margins, won 141⁄2-131⁄2.
'You keep reminding yourself that we had a large rent on Valderrama; we had a large rent on Brookline, where we lost, and on Valderrama, where we watered, but only so,' said Bjørn, having seen the Class 2018 winning 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to rent 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone on that layer that this isn't over.
You're going to full open tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you have the score on the board.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I've said all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we're so well aware of what's on the other side - the biggest players in the world.\"
Happy how his players have behaved on a tough golf course, Bear added: \"I would never take the speaker first.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow there are individual achievements, and there is another thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there individually, you're being tested out of your capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to communicate to players; get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and he must go and get the best out of himself too.\"
In contrast to Bjørn, the opposite number Jim Furyk will be on the lookout for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Fury himself has been at both ends of the reverse operations in the great last days, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe left the Mirakel in Medinah.
'I think about every fucking word of it,' he said in answer to be asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, had gathered his players on their way into the last day.
«We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to get started with the fast start you saw on Brookline, as you saw on Medinah.
When the moment goes a way, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We'll put our line-up corresponding and get the gums going in a way that feels good, you know, we'll try to do something magic tomorrow.\"
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lease the game and meet Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the deal.
'I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way through,' said Bjorn about his picks of singles.
Germany’s New Warships Yet Set Up Once Again
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been ordered in 2014 to replace elderly warships from the Cold War Age, but it will not be there until at least next year due to faulty system and incurring costs, reported local media.
The launch of Rhineland-Palatinate, the leadership of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frgatterne, has now been designated for the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the fleet in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships of the Sea Defense ordered back in 2007, will come as a substitute for the elderly Bremen class Fregates.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful cannon, a series of anti-planes and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to place the newest frigates for up to two years away from the ports at home.
Yet, continuous delay means that the groundbreaking warships, which seem to allow Germany to exercise foreign power, will already be out - of - date when they enter service, note Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 freak made headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There was little known about the reasons for the tournament, but the German media quoted a number of important “software and hardware errors” that made the warship useless if placed on a battle mission.
Software errors were particularly important when ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the workforce of older Bremen fregatas.
It also turned out that the ship is dramatically overweight, reducing its performance and restricting its fleet to future upgrades.
The 700-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the wrong hardware, the price of the entire project - including crew training - is also a problem.
It is said to have reached a dimmering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - starting from €2.2 billion (EURO)
Problems related to the latest frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany’s fleet is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the fleet has in fact 'nearly ended in distributive ships'.
The officer said the problem has been built on over time, because old ships were broken down, but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He regrets that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class of the Fregatets was able to join the fleet.
National Trust Listener in Secret Life of Bats
New research carried out on an ownership in the Scottish highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in the pursuit of food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the normal and soprano piperrelles and also brown long ears and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recordings will be placed at important locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS additions and volunteers will also perform mobile investigations using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bat calls and the species that do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, the science counselor for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitats, natural worlds, are most important for bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work as a purchase of meadows and how it is best to maintain a similar forest area for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and over Britain have significantly decreased over the last century.
They are threatened with construction and development work that affects the sleep and loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as flypapers and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats are not really blind.
Yet, because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to detect errors and obstacles in their flight route.
NTS, responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres [66,000 ha] of land around the country, take the bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out examinations, howl site inspections, and sometimes save lives.
The organization has even created Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve on the Three Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Property Manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
'Here on Three we have a great area for bats,' he said.
“We have old buildings, many veteran trees, and all the good habitats.
But there's a lot about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other property, will help us understand more about what they need to thrive on.\"
He underscores the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance within real estates, since it is possible that endless destruction of a single buffer can kill up to 400 women’s bats and young people, and perhaps destroy an entire local population.
The bats are at peace, and it is illegal to kill, plow, or disturb them, or destroy their clumping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the audience to come in and help.
She said: \"We still have much to learn about our bats, and for many of our species we do not know how their populations are going.\"
Ronaldo rejects parliamentary debt in the lawyer sues German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has marked the warrants against him as ‘false news’, saying that people ‘want to promote themselves’ by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus the Forward has been responsible for choosing an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is claimed to have paid her $375.000 to keep quiet about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live instagram video Ronaldo, 33, to his 142 million followers, says only hours after debt, that debt is 'false news'.
\"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news, says five times the Goldball winner into the camera.
'They want to market themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be known to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and everything good, 'let the player play and smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are committed to suing Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called \"an unacceptable report of suspicions in the area of privacy\", according to Reuters
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for \"moral damage in an amount that accounts for the seriousness of the regulatory breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the last few years.\"
The alleged event is said to have occurred in June 2009 at a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player’s room, claiming to have selected her anal, according to documents submitted at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the assumed event and told him he was \"99%\" a \"good guy\" and failed with \"one percent\".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her photographs taken from the injuries of a hospital, but was later agreed on an equalization because she felt “treasure of retaliation” and was concerned about “to become publicly soft.”
The 34-year-old says she's now trying to change the housing as she continues to be traumatised by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK would forever undo losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would forever undo that if it lost its status as a valuable before Brexit car production, my business secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was “about” that the Topotecan UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
'We need a deal,' said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of limit delays in case a non-contract Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, where 90% was exported to the rest of the EU.
‘My idea is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we’ll see production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke,doyata’s Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have raised fear of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns about what the car manufacturers say are are the risks of supply chains in the event of a non-contract Brexit.
Toyota's production line is driven on a just-in-time basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both Britain and the EU for cars ordered.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, disturbances may arise at the limit which the industry claims may lead to delay and lack of parts.
To keep more than a day's value of inventory at Derbyshire's factory would be impossible, said the company, and thus production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Checkers' plan for future relations with the EU is 'net calibrated to avoid checks at the border'.
'We must have an agreement. We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I say, not just to enjoy the success today, but for us to seize this possibility, 'he told the BBC Radio 4's daily program.
\"Provide from not only Toyota, but other producers are that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.\"
Toyata could not control the length of production, but in the longer term they warned that additional costs would reduce the competitive costs of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the Unite Union at the plant, said that his members are more concerned with: \"After my experience, when these jobs go, they never come back.
A spokesperson said to the government: 'We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU'.
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-ranking meeting with District Attorney Rod Rosenstein could be \"pressed back a week\" as the battle against the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the white house Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Councils Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian electoral interference, links between Trump helpers and Russia and the potential obstacle to justice by the President.
Corrupt Trump wants to join the General of the Attorney Generals or not, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, has been feeding Washington gossip for months.
Earlier in the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed a lease to register conversations with Trump and the opportunity to remove the president by means of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein refused the report.
But last Monday he went to the white house, and it was reported that he was about to step up.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then with the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would 'pretend' not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid crashing with the Senate Commission hearing where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed full vote from the Senate.
Trump his press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: \"There has been no date set; it can be this week, but I can and can imagine that there will be another week delayed because of everything else that happens in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like keeping the pressure up to date.\"
Some reporters may disagree: Sanders has not held a press orientation for the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of orientations was not due to a dissatisfaction with the TV-reporter's game for the gallery, although she said: \"I am not indifferent to them.\"
She mentioned and that direct contact between Trump and the press is going to increase.
“The president holds more press conferences than any president has done before,” she said, “just enough without providing proof of the claim. “We have been watching.”
Sanders says updates will still happen, but \"if the pressure gets the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do it this way, and you've seen us do it often in the last few weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press orientation if you can talk directly to the president of the United States.\"
Trump sometimes accepts questions when traveling from the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It's unusual for the president to hold a press conference alone.
In New York this week, the president might have demonstrated why, where he appeared to lead the reporters without shame, and almost bizarrely.
Health Secretary writes about Brexit fear of EU workers in NHS, Scotland
The Health Secretary has written to EU workers working at NHS in Scotland to express thanks and a wish to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter even though it is less than six months before the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to taking on the costs of applications that have the status of residents of the EU working in delegated public services.
In the letter Freeman wrote as follows: \"In the summer, negotiations on withdrawal between Britain and the EU have continued, and it is nearing the expected conclusion of the harvest.
Nevertheless, the British government has stepped up preparations in the event of no agreement.
I understand this must be a difficult time for all of you.
Therefore, I will now repeat how much I value the contributions to all added, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU, and beyond, bring with them valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the health sector and benefit patients and society.
Scotland is a very clear diver home, and we would like you to stay here.\"
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing acute surgery after head injury
Linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays the Tennessee State Tigers, went through an acute operation after having sustained a head injury when the team lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports The Tennessee newspaper.
The main training for Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told the reporter that the damage occurred just before the break.
'He came to the sideline and collapsed, in a way' said Reed.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing it on a stretcher and taking him behind for further evaluation.
An official Tennessee State spokesman told WSMV that Abercrombie had completed surgery at the Vanderbilt medical center.
There is no detail about the extent of the damage yet, said Harris, and added that Tennessee State is still trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie goes to college for the second year and is in her first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five roofs before he got hurt in Saturday's fight, and is now up in 18 total this season.
Foreign buyers have to pay a higher document fee when purchasing ownership in Britain
Foreign buyers have to pay a higher document fee when purchasing property in the United Kingdom. The extra income is to be used to help the homeless follow the new plans of the conservatives
Determined will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
Increase in document fees will be added to those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
Statskasse expects an increase of up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Theresa May today will announce that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in Britain, and the extra income will be used to help the homeless.
This decision will be viewed as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s attracting young voters who tend much to be inclined to offer reasonable housing.
The increase in document fees will be added to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain, and the extra money will strengthen the government’s desire to reduce the number of intruders.
The fee, which is added to the current document fee, includes the higher levels introduced two years ago at the two-year-old farm and rental settlement sites, may be as much as 3 percent.
The Treasury expects that the decision will be made up to £120 million a year.
About 13 percent of London’s settlers are bought by residents outside the United Kingdom, which makes prices higher, and it becomes harder for first - time buyers to enter the residential market.
Many well-known areas of the country - especially in the capital city - have become ghost cities because of the large number of foreign buyers who most of the time stay in other countries.
This new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson would cut the document fee to help several young people buy their first home.
He appealed to a large construction company to keep up the prizes by getting real estates, but not using them, and asked Theresa May to give up the quotas on reasonable housing to fix Britain's 'burstadsskam'.
Corbyn has announced a series of interesting suggestions for urban reforms, including controlled rentals and the closure of open-ended exhibitions.
He will and give greater power to build new settlements.
May said: \"Yesterday I said I would dedicate my position to bringing back the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
That means fixing the broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build a life here.
Nevertheless, it may not be true that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in Britain, or in foreign companies, to buy settlements as it is for hardworking British residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has been too far away, and the adjudication by being axes is real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
The boss of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his \"ultimate ambition\" is to be the manager of Scotland at some point.
The shot (42) scurries over the challenge of revitalizing the club from the north-east. Currently they are in third place in League One, only three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, having led St Mirren back to the Scottish elite series in the previous season.
'I wanted to play for my country playing.
I got a B-land battle, and that was it,\" said Ross to Scotland BBC Sportssound.
\"But I am raised to see Scotland in Hamden together with my father, and there has always been something that has pulled me back.
The option can only come if I have success as a club-manager.»
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he hasn't been anxious to come after so many established names in such a big club, since he's previously turned off approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
\"For the moment, success for me will be measured if I 'can get this club back in the Premier League.\"
On the basis of the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they belong at home in the Premier League,\" he said.
'It's not easy to get them there, but I can probably only think of myself as successful if I can get the club back there.'
Ross is only three years into his career as a manager, after a period of assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month period in Hearts' training equipment.
He then helped Alloa to recover from the third level, transforming St Mirren, who was about to move down to the title winner of the championship series the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did while playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkik, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
\"It was enough a crossroads,\" he says of leading Alloa.
\"I thought being a manager would be much better for me than being a player.
It sounds bizarre, because I did it well, lit it well and liked it relatively well.
But gambling can be tough.
There are a lot of things you have to get through every week.
I still notice when it comes to stress and the pressure on the job, but it feels right to be a manager.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I am. It's the most comfortable I've ever felt in my own body in my whole adult life.”
Sunday, September 30, you can right the full interview at Sports Sound, Radio Scotland, between 12 and 13.
The examination shows that the perfect time for a pint is at 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday
The heat wave of the summer has led to an increase in the intensity of pulverizing pubs in Britain, but it has increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, the room increased by 2.7 percent in the food industry - but in the restaurant industry it went down by 4.8 percent, showing the statistics.
As Peter Martin, who is responsible for the statistics, said: \"At the sun, and the fact that England was in the World Cup longer than planned, July followed the pattern of June where pubs went up 2.8 percent, only that restaurants became even harder.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurant business just got worse in July.
Pubs and bars selling drinks made it significantly better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubars selling food, got and felt the decline in the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It may seem that people only want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars, the drinking room had increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food had dropped by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, an analyst for travel and leisure at RSM, said: \"The outcome is the continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather, as well as the impact of a huge social or sports event, will still be the main factors when it comes to the outdoors industry.
It is no surprise that the restaurant industry is still going to wear off. A fall in the hall of 4.8% annually would be bad to get at the top of a laxing cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for food driven operators. Time will show if the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can provide a prolonged breathing space.»
The total salsauking across pubs and restaurants, including openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the tapering of branded products.

One in five children has secret profiles on social media that they hide from parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - has secret profiles on social media as they hide from parents and teachers, showing an investigation
Examination of 20,000 further students reveals an increase in false Insta profiles
This news has increased its fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a \"head\" profile they show parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - creates profiles on social media as they keep secret for the adults.
A survey of 20,000 students on the moving board revealed a strong increase in fake Insta profiles - a reference to the Instagram Image Sharing Platform.
The news has increased its fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students say they have a sterile head profile they refer to parents, while they have private profiles.
A mother who stumbled over the secret side of her 13 - year - old daughter found a teenager who was encouraging others to “elect me”.
The research, made by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistress' Conference (HMC) on different skulars, found that 40 percent of the between 11 and 18 years had two profiles, and half of these admitted to have private users.
The manager of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: \"It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create places online where parents and teachers cannot find them.\"
Eilith Doyle becomes the vote of the Atletane in the Scottish regime
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as a non-administrative director in the annual general meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most decorated trackman in Scotland, and director Ian Beattie describes the event as a great opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from her extensive international experience over the last decade.
“Eilidh has a great deal of respect across Scotland, the United Kingdom and the civil society of the world, and we are sure that the right of free movement in Scotland can benefit from getting her into the regime,” said Beattie.
Doyle said, \"I am eager to act as a voice for the practitioners, and I hope I can contribute and help sports in Scotland.\"
The American, who has gold from both 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996 among his total four Olympic gold and now is a regular guest at the BBC, was unable to go after a drop.
On Twitter he wrote: \"Today it is a month since I was struck.
I couldn't move.
Doctors said it was only time to tell me if I was going to be okay or to what extent.
It has our exhausting work, but I've recovered quite well, learned to go again, and today I do flexibility drills!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!\"
Split online units on breast pump commercials comparing mothers to milk cows
A breast pump company has split opinion on the Internet with an advertisement that compares mothers to milk cows.
To mark what is described as ‘the first quiet, seductive breast pump of the world’, the technology company Elvie released a small false advertisement inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom of the new pump to mothers who extract milk.
Four real mothers dance in a high-filled barn with cows, to a song that includes text like: \"Yes, I am milking myself, but you don't see any tail\" and \"If you don't notice it, this isn't spinner, it's my tits.\"
The reference continues: 'Pump it out, pump it out, I feed these kids, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies'.
On the other hand, the advertising published on the company’s Facebook page has created controversy on the web.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it illuminates the “fear” of the dairy industry.
\"Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to become pregnant and food to produce milk, only that the calves are trusted from the only days after birth\", writes one.
Elvie breast pump is discreet in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another remarked: “I understandably traumatic for both mother and child
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?\"
Another added: \"For a advertising remover.\"
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she seemed to be “fine.”
'I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd have one if I was still a grandmother.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
This ad is a little crazy, but I took him for what he is.
This is a brilliant product, wrote one.
Another commented: “This is a fun advertisement for mothers who pump (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This is not an ad that boasts or judges the dairy industry.»
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they have all danced with the dish pump wrapped in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is perfectly quiet, has no leases or pipes, and is discreetly within a breast-fed bra, giving women freedom to move, hold their young, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: «Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it tends to be a wave and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers who extract milk and milk cows, we want to put search lights on breast pumping and challenges associated with it, and at the same time demonstrate the unlikely liberation of the new pump, in a entertaining and recognizable way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During the Moteuka in London, a mother showed up on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children move in silence to a tent camp on the border to Texas
The number of prison immigrant children has peaked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the strict policy of the Trump Administration has introduced makes it more difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that standing up to a child may threaten their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk of this increase in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members will be forced to submit fingerprints and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, from Congress and Customs Enforcement, witnessed the arrest of dozens of people who have applied to be sponsors of single minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested persons had nothing on their record.
“Nearly 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and much of these are criminals foreigners.
So we're going to keep on persecuting these human beings,\" said Albence.
According to camp officials, new rules have now been introduced to deal with the children. Rules require that some of them now have to be in court before a month has passed, against earlier 60 days.
Many people will participate in video calls and not during personal meetings, to get their say try to have an immigration domain.
Those who are not eligible for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or runaways, they say added to the camp, reports that have appeared in recent months say the same.
People say that these concerns are greater in large facilities such as Tornillo. Because of the size of the facility, it is more likely that a child’s wear is ignored.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or say hate, of veins, can strengthen traumas that many people are already struggling with.
Syria requests U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also asked for Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country is now at war in the eighth year.
Moualem, who acts as Deputy Prime Minister, said that leading forces remain illegal on Syrian soil during the shoot-down of fighting terrorism and “will be treated from it”.
He said to the assembly: \"You must withdraw immediately and without instructions.\"
Moualem insisted that “the war against terrorism is almost over” in Syria, how more than 36,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to “fight a sacred battle until all Syrian territory has been reinsa” for both terrorist groups and “illegal presence of prowess.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and consulting both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are against President Bashar al-assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - torn country.
When the refugee problems were discussed, Moualem said it was safe for them to come back, and he blamed some Western countries for having “stripped irrational fear” of the environment that caused the refugees to stay away.
\"We have asked the international community and the humanitarian organisations to prepare for the return,\" he said.
'They make politics out of something that would be a purely humanitarian problem.'
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major insurrection, has created an opportunity to continue pushing forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkey agreement averts a major attack by Russian-stressed Syrian forces in the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem underscores that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against jihadiar, including warriors from the Nusra Front, associated with Al-Qaeda, who “will be wiped out.”
The UN emissary, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to gather soon the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to draw up a postwar law for Syria and pave the way to the elections.
Moualem lays down conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the Committee and says that the panel's work should be limited — to review the nature of the current constitution — and to warn against interference.
Kvifor Trump is going to win another semester
With that logic, Trump will win the 2020 re-election if not, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the presidency is due to scandals and national law.
No doubt that would be “the most dramatic ending of a presidency ever.”
At the time of writing, there are no characters that the viewers have gone tired.
Since 2014, CNN has double its rating in the best shipping time to 1.05 million, while MSNBC almost has triple its to 1.6 million.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in best time, from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has a doctor at the top of the cable racing with as much as 3.5 million viewers on evenings of big news.
This is a fire that people are being shut down because it's something we don't understand, said Neal Baer in the ABC Drama, Designated Survivor, who's about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress Building.
Nell Scovell, old comedy writer and author of the Just the Funny Parts: And a Fear Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
She's thinking of a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Why?
\"Because he makes me laugh,\" he replied, following Scovell.
It's the entertainment value of the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, Washington’s history may determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant family members may be together and greet the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes further than being an informed citizen when you find yourself in the sixth hour to see a panel of experts debating Bob Woodward's use of sources of deep-depth background — for the book \"Fear,\" Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of ostrich seal to $15,000-one garment thick of arrogance - said Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniel's unsavory description of Trump's, eh, anatomy.
Personally, I'm never going to look at Super Mario the same way again.
\"Parts of what he does to make it feel like a reality program is that he gives you something every night,\" said Brent Montgomery, daily leader at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creates by \"Pawn Stars\", about the show that goes leading with Trump's employees and daily disputes (enter into a fight with NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).
You cannot miss a single episode, otherwise you no longer hang out.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was over 25 degrees and the sun outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat in and looked at MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He couldn't turn away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate Commission and the future of the Supreme Court hung in a thin thread.
\"I think when we did all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, \"This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,\" said Fleiss.
\"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.\"

Money from outside streams into the densest intermediate match
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th district sees an abundance of money, thanks to a conversion of the districts of Congress that led to two seated members fighting for the same seat.
The recent remodeling of the Pittsburgh suburb brings forward the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district through a special elections last spring.
Lamb fights against another resident, Republican Keith Rothfus, today representative of the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, who largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The map was redrawn after the January University of Pennsylvania decided that the old districts were illegally designed to benefit the Republicans.
The competition for the 17th district has launched a arms draw on the funding of the campaigns, between the major parties their monetarys, the Democratic Congress Committee and the Republican Congress Committee.
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a button says in a closely followed special elections in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat had been a Republican for over a decade, and President Trump won the district with more than 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats little advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador because of support for China, but withdrew
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing with no negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama for the partners to throw out the Trump organization's leader group.
The State Secretarys decided to bring the U.S. leaders back on diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama over the “last decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan ” — said Heather Nauert, the State’s spokeswoman, in a statement on time this month.
But punishment was only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development, and financial support.
The medical penalties, which contained cuts for financial support and targeted limitations in view of visas, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings developed, North American and Central American officials postponed a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year that was considered a step forward to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid - September, the top administrators informed them that they wanted the conference to proceed and put a stop to the assessment of the penalty for El Salvador.
It has now been said that Vice President Mike Pence will meet the conference, which has been scheduled in the middle of October, as a signal of the relevance of the administration to the collection, said the diplomats.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new tough messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton would not comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by an outside analyst who works closely with the administration and also spoke under the supervision of anonymity.
Study history
One waits for special adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice, which is now significant proof of in the public protocols.
According to the reports, Mueller should have turned the focus on the investigation against whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia's idea attack on our choice.
If Congress should trade directors, Trump will have to stand in place in this body, preparing to overwhelm the voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
There's a lot of \"quad\" and I don't mean to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable - nor for his counterpart in Europe.
It is the choice to consider all of us on both sides of the pond that will affect the length of the battle.
In 1938 German officers were ready for a coup d’état against Hitler, only the West had resisted him and helped the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and missed a possibility to avoid the oars of bloodbath this led to.
The course of history revolves around such a turning point, and democracy its inexorable march is accelerated or postponed.
The Americans are facing a number of these turning points right now.
What will we do if Trump kicks Deputy Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been on deep water ever since this newspaper revealed that last year he proposed to listen to the president in secret and speculated on whether he was unfit for his role.
Rosenstein's victory The Times' description is inaccurate.
\"How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or he is accepted by the Supreme Court despite threatening allegations of sexual abuse, and dishonest testimony?
And above all, in the middle of the election, will we vote for a Congress that holds Trump responsible?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're wrong because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country in which I have my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, she sent me off guard to light Sabbath lights on the table saying the Swastika.
When this is my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before the meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers accept Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that saying over the Australians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a good starting point to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevents the midway player Graham Dorrans from doing his first performance this season before the 2-2 result against Villerreal, but he thinks Rangers can use this result as a leapboard for bigger things.
\"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team,\" said the 31-year-old.
'We went into the fight with the belief that we could get something, and came out with a point.
Maybe we could take it to the end, but everything in all is a draw probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we came out in the second half and was the better one.
On Thursday, there's still gonna be a big European night.
Hopefully, we can get three points, but it'll be a tough fight. They got a good result in their previous game, but with the audience behind us, I'm sure we can run on and get a positive result.
The last year has definitely been tough, with everything that's happened to my injuries and changes to the club, but now everything feels good.
The stable is good and the gutans thrive; the training is good.
Hopefully we can run on now, put the previous season behind us and be successful.»
Women lose sleep over this fear of pension savings
Despite the fact that participants in an investigation had clear thoughts about how they would be taken care of, few talked about it with family members.
About half of those who participated in a survey from the insurance company Nationwide said that they talked to their spouses about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
\"People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they don't take the necessary steps to have that conversation,\" says the vice president of Nationwide, Holly Snyder.
Here you go.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of yourself if you do not make your wish known well in the process.
Work with a counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these options may be a major part of fixing the costs.
Pick up a financial advisor: Your counselor can also help you find out how to pay for these expenses.
The finance options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance, a cash-value life insurance to help pay the expenses, or your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Create legal documents: Refuse legal matches before starting.
Get a health authorisation in place so that you designate a person you trust to monitor your medical treatment and to ensure that professional deals in accordance with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
You can also consider a proxy for your finances.
You should choose a person you trust to make financial decisions and make sure that your calculations are paid if you do not have the option yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Make sure your old parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down all of these details in a written plan, so you are ready.
'It's not just the finances that it's about, but who's tired?' asked Martin.
\"What kind of medicine is that?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have the plan ready.\"

Earthquakes and Tsunamiar in Indonesia
At least 384 people are killed by a powerful earthquake and one tsunami that met the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, public officials claim, and the number of dead is expected to increase.
Without the ability to communicate, auxiliary workers have not received any information from Dongala, a region north of Palu near the epicenter of the tremor with a strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, estimated at 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary at the time of the quake and the tsunami.
Dongala is an area that stretches more than 300 km along the northwest coast of the island.
The region, which is an administrative region lower than a province, had in 2017 an estimated population of 299 200.
Fishing and guarding are the berebjälk of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel extraction is and is important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, following the Indonesia disaster relief office.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed and several hundred houses were destroyed by a tsunami in Dongala.
In 1996, the west side of Dongala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is in the seismic Aging in the Pacific and becomes a common framework of earthquakes.
Here are some of the big tremors and tsunamis in the last few years:
2004: A huge earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226 000 people along the Indian Sea coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of huge earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A shaking of strength 6.8 hit south of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that crashed into the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.

The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested and charged with authority at home
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice president Sarah Palin, has been arrested, charged with assault.
Following a report released by the Alaskan state police, Palin (29) was arrested for suspicion of power in the world, interference in the reporting of government in the world, and opposition to arrest.
According to the police report, he picked up the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the crime.
Palin is being held in custody in the Mat-Su prison, and is being held against bail $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared “not guilty” when asked, reported the network.
Palin faces three Class A abuses, which means that he can be imprisoned for up to a year and receive $250,000 in fines.
He has also been charged with class B abuse, which can be punished with one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin's been charged with anything criminal.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Mama, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
Saka's up in the veteran court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was targeted for attacks in the world, intervened in a reporting of power in the world and to hold a weapon while he was intoxicated in connection with the event.
His lover had claimed that he struck her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for having linked his son’s powerful behavior to PTSD, which stems from when he served in Iraq.
An earthquake and a tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 persons have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake, with its strength of 7.5, triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of worlds.
Electricity and communication networks are down, and the number of casualties is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit just outside the central part of Sulawesi, north of the capital city of Jakarta.
Videos showing the dramatic moment of shaking are flirting with social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors want very rarely the death penalty for suspect in New York terrorism.
The New York federal prosecutors want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been committed for a federal offense in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) shall have used a Home Depot rental to conduct an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway on the lower Manhattan in October, where he drove down pedestrians and bikers on the road.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must be able to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “by will” and that he “willfully” caused the serious, bodily damage, following a note recorded in the southern district of New York.
Both of these events may be the basis for a possible death penalty, says the legal document.
Week after the attack, a federal jury handed over a list of 22 charges, including eight charges for murder cases involving money blackmail, usually used by federal prosecutors in connection with organized crime, and a sighting for power and the destruction of motor vehicle.
The attack called for \"essential planning and surrendering\", said the prosecutors and state how Saipov carried out the attack as \"disgusting, cruel and depraved\".
«Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov causes damage and loss for the family and veins of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco», says the note.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last southern district in New York City has condemned capital punishment in a case.
The aim, Khalid Barnes, was condemned for killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a capital punishment was executed in a federal case in New York City was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were sentenced to conspiracy to commit espionage to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both were prepared in the electric chair.
Saipov, original from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of repentance in the days and months that followed, following legal documents.
He told the detectives that what he did was best, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after watching ISIS videos on the phone, says the charges.
He also asked for the ISIS flag in the hospital room, said the police.
He has not declared himself guilty on all charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, says they're \"expectable drawer\" with a decision to the prosecution.
\"We believe that deciding to go after the death penalty rather than accepting a declaration of debt for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only unlink trauma from the event for all involved\", said Patton.
Saipov’s defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Tory meiner Nigel Farage should rent Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to \"mobilize the People's Army\" today, during a protest at the Tory International Council.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said that the politicians had to 'feel pressure' from the Eurosceptics, as one of Theresa May's Members suggested that he rent negotiations with the EU.
The conservative, mean Member of Parliament, Peter Bone, told the protestors in Birmingham that Britain “had been out” no, if Farage was Minister of Brexit.
With May’s challenge to reconcile its deeply divided ranks has been underscored by a separate protest in the city, held by Tories who wants to stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep the plan with the Chequers compromise on the right track after attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
The Allies insist that she press for an agreement with Brussels, despite its withdrawal, and force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and its 'kaos'.
Bone told Leave Means Leave grouping in Solihull that he would like to 'throw Chequers'
He suggested that Farage should be given a decent rank and be held responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
He said, “If he had ruled, we would be out now.”
The MEP from Wellingborough added: 'I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject Chequers'.
In order to say resistance to the EU, he said: 'We do not fight worlds to be subordinated.
We will make our property promises in our own country.\"
Bone rejects the claim that the mass of the people has changed since the 2016 election: \"The idea that the British people have changed their meaning and want to become is quite false.\"
Brexit champions from Tory, Andrea Jenkyns, also took part in the march. She told the reporters: \"I only say: Prime Minister, listen to the people!\"

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets closer to the title after the jurors give say over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valteri Botta qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orderly orders from Mercedes came to play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start on the race, and let Hamilton take care of himself in what he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vetel was first into the depot and let Hamilton get into traffic at the back of the loop, which should be our decision.
The Mercedes ran into the depot a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after some action side-by-side that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the inside in danger of not being able to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started, on his 21st anniversary, in the rear row and was in seventh place at the end of the first round.
After that, he leads large parts of the race as he went for a quick finish with the goal of driving past the 4th Kimi Raikkonen.
He entered the depot in the 44th round, but could not speed up the last eight rounds while Raikonen got fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valteri did a great job all weekend, and was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job that has both first and second,\" said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein on a election day due to her instigation that she did not read the letter from Christine Blasey Ford where she appeals to the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh for sexual abuse.
During a speech at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not mention the witness Ford had given the Senate Commission directly, but rather commented that what goes on in the Senate showed that people were \"bad and ugly and talking untrue\".
“The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and bad and uncomfortable and talk untrue,” he said.
\"When you look at publications and leaks and say, \"Oh, I didn't.
I didn't.'
Thinking about dives?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak it?
Do you think of her answer... did you leave the document - \"oh, uh, what?
Oh, no.
I won't let it.'
Wait a minute.
Lak, no, we didn't let it, he added, while he imitates the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with details of charges against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was played earlier in September - but Feinstein refused to leak from her office.
'I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't draw her story,' said Feinstein to the Committee, following The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, for which she asked.”
But her denial did not fall on good ground with the president, who commented on it at the Saturday election: \"I win you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe it didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen.\"
While he continues to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been charged with the bad sexual behavior of three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the charges for their own gain.
\"They are determined to take back power in every way they see it necessary.
You see badness, terror, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control,\" said the President of Mediaite.

Air traffic controllers lose their lives to ensure that hundreds of planes escape earthquakes
A pilot in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after losing his life in what he continues to ensure that a plane of hundreds of passengers got safely into the air.
More than 800 persons have lost their lives, and many are missing after a great earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong demand continues to disrupt the area, and many prisoners are in wreckage in the city of Palu.
However, despite his associates ’ escape for life, Anthonius Gunawan Agung (21) refused to leave his post in the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, although wildly swinging.
He stayed behind to make sure that the plane on the runway, Batik Air Flight 6321, took off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower as he thought it would collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
The chairman of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decisions may have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News Australia.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in a larger city.
Unfortunately, he walked away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
He added, “This is a heartbreaking thing.”
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the number of casualties will increase to thousands, while the country's crisis relief agency says access to the small towns of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
«The number of dead increases while we find bodies trapped under buildings. Many of them we cannot reach,» said the bureautist Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 20 feet [6 m] have destroyed Palu, which will keep a mass funeral on Sunday.
Nadi aid comes in with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said to Sky News: “An ambulance with several bodies comes at every minute.
It's hard to find clean water.
The small shops have become robberies.”
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross struggles to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find when they arrive.
This is already a tragedy, but it may get much worse.\"
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday and said to the military in the country: \"I ask you all to work around the clock to do everything they can to help with the evacuation.
Are they ready?\" reported CNN.
Indonesia was first caught by earthquakes in Lombok this year, and 550 people died.
Air controller in Micronesia: Air Niugini is reporting now man missing after lagoon plane crash
The airline operating an aircraft that crashed in a Laguna in Micronesia, Pacific, reports that a man is missing, after earlier saying that all 47 of the passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane before it sank.
Air Niugini said that from Saturday afternoon, they don't know where the human passenger is.
The airline said they work with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline gave no more details about the passenger, and his age and nationality are unknown.
Local boat owners helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water when it tried to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Government officials said on Friday that seven persons have been sent to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and everyone was in stable condition.
It's still unknown what caused the crash and what actually happened.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
'It was extremely good,' said Jaynes.
Jaynes added that he and other passengers were able to wade through the water, which came up to life, to the nadu exits on the plane before it sank.
He said the flight crew was panicking and screaming, and he incurred a head injury that was not serious.
The U.S. Navy said that sails in the nearby area, working on a Kai, also saved passengers with a rubber boat that they used to transport passengers to land before the plane sank on about 30 meters.
The data from the Aviation Safety Network website show that 111 people have died in the controllers of PNG registered airlines in the last 20 years, but none of them flew with Air Niugini.
Analysts make timeline during the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutors presented all evidence of Saturday during the appeal trial for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice's analyst Paul Rowlett quoted several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He presented to the jury how he copped recordings from mobile phones to find out what happened the night Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the defendant Quinton Tellis (29).
According to the newspaper The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett told us that he used location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was together with Chamber's night she died, in contrast to what Tellis explained earlier.
When the location data showed that Tellis’ cell phone was with Chamber’s cell phone while he said he was with friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford quoted on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
Then he asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford his car that night, Sanford said that he \"Low, because my car was in Nashville.\"
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
But their mobile phone plans showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers died, Tellis deleted messages, calls and Chambers' contact information from his mobile phone.
'He destroyed her from his life,' said Hale.
The defense is due to end the case on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to go to the jury later the same day.

New York Children’s Passes sue couples for fired after “racistic” text message
A New York babysitter sues a couple to fire her based on discrimination after she received a miscasted text from her mother who complained that she was \"one black person.\"
The couple have refused to be racist and have compared the prosecution with 'expression'.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was dissatisfied when she saw that the baby nurse she had added, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work for the first time in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEI, ONE ONE A SVART PERSON,” wrote Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent him to the babysitter Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, the inappropriate Plasco-Flaxman child-career Maurice fired, saying that the previous child-career, who was afro-American, had done a bad job, so now she wanted someone from the Philippines, according to The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day of work before they sent her home in an Uber.
She wants $350 a day for the job she should have had, even if it was out of contract, where she was supposed to live with her family.
'I want to show them that it's not okay to do that,' she said to The New York Post on Friday, and added, 'I know it's discrimination.'
The couple refused to be racist, saying that firing Maurice was the only thing they could do after insulting her, because of your fear that she would take revenge.
'My wife had sent something to her that she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” said the husband Joel Plasco to The New York Post.
\"But would you let someone you have insulted your children, even if you didn't mean to insult them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it.”
Plasco compared the prosecution to \"expression,\" saying that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a very difficult situation.
\"Are you really going to take on a person in such a situation?
That's not a nice thing to do,' said investor Plasco.
As the matter goes on, the public has been quick to judge the social media couple and criticized them for their behavior and logic.
The publisher behind the Paddington books was afraid people wouldn't like a talking bear, revealing a new letter.
The daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the approval of the first book, commented: \"It is difficult to imagine what it was like to read the book for the first time before it was published.
It is very fun to know now how successful Paddington was.”
Jankel said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected. She added that she had mixed the women during her 60th anniversary book, because her father died last year.
In the case of Paddington, who she portrays as “a very important member of the family, ” she noted that her father was proud of his success inside.
\"He was a rather quiet man, and he never boasted,\" she said.
\"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having children who achieved something: you will be proud of them even if it isn't really you who is behind it.
I think he saw on Paddington's success that way.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave praise to Paddington himself.\"
My daughter was going to die and I had to say goodbye to her phone.
When she landed, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice in no hurry, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
'Nad called regularly to say it was really bad, that they didn't think she was going to make it,' said Ednan-Laperouse.
\"Then Nad called to say she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, \"Tashi, I love you so much, dear.
I'm coming to be with you soon.
I'll be right there.
The medical doctors had given her so that her heart would insist that pumping was slow on the way out of her system.
She was already dying, and now her body was about to shut down.
I just sat there, knowing that this happened.
I couldn't wait or scream, because I was in a room surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep everything in.\"
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now suffocating over the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane with other passengers who had no idea what she had just gone through.
\"No one knew anything,\" she said.
“I sat with my head bent while my tears fell.”
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I knew how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.\"
Grieving women hang notes on the bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lose their loved ones who commit suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have attached notes to a bridge in Wales to inspire and get people who are mindful of taking suicide to change their minds and dial their numbers.
Davis his son Tyler was 13 years old when he started to struggle with depression and took his life when he was 18.
\"I don't want any parents to feel the way I know me every day.\"
Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, said that her son was a talented cook with a smile that infected her.
“He was known to everyone because of his smile.
They said that his smile lit up every room.\"
But before he died, he ended up at work, because he was in a \"real dark place.\"
In 2014, Tyler’s 11 - year - old brother first found Tyler after taking his own life.
Davis said: \"I am still concerned that the little brother may have been affected by Tyler's death.\"
Davis wrote the note \"To let people know that there are other people out there who care and who they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit there alone, you need to talk to someone.\"
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davis for many years, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mother.
\"He never told him that he was sad, depressed, or anything,\" she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we’ll realize that he’s starting to behave differently.
He was in the basement emotionally on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts, he did not see them alone.”
She said that his death was very traumatic for the children, and they continue working through the trauma: “It’s a big void in our family now.
We're all fucked up.
But we all must fight to live on.\"

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin line while the FBI starts the investigation
'I thought that if we actually got something like what he's asking -- a limited investigation -- maybe we could get a little solitude,' said Flake on Saturday, and added that he's afraid of the committee 'come together' in the middle of a partisansan backlock.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They hesitate because of the timing.
Midvals in the United States are only five weeks away, November 6, and if the Republicans do not do well, this will make it difficult for them to choose Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called Senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley that way, then he was the secretary of Bush.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
They're going to vote in the Senate, 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Kavanaugh is able to gather at least 50 votes in the Senate, and with 50 voices, Mike Pense, the vice president of the United States, can give him the last voice and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
Number of defectors in North Korea going down under Kim
Number of North Korean defectors to South Korea have crashed since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, reporting a South Korean legislator
The Park Byeong seug referred to data from the South Korean Department of Unit, saying there were 1127 defectors last year — compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter boundaries between North Korea and China and more expensive smuggling fees are the main reasons that the number has fallen.
Pyongyang has not spoken publicly.
Most of the North Korean dropouts get Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most refugees through China have the longest limit of North Korea and are easier to cross than the severely protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China views defectors as illegal immigrants and not refugees, and often sends them back under compulsion.
The relations between North and South Korea - which are still technically still at war - have improved in the last few months.
This month the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met to negotiate the disarmament of nuclear weapons.
These conversations come after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they became the sole force of working for a nuclear Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, owed the United States nothing since then.
“Without being able to rely on the United States, we cannot trust that our country is safe, and in such a situation we cannot dissipate our weapons first,” said Ri in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh \"hysterical,\" saying he can't serve in the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, “hysterically” and said that he has too much temper to serve in the U.S. Supreme Court.
Pelosi called Kavanaugh \"hysterical\" in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
'I know that if a woman had behaved like that, she would have been called 'hysterical',' said Pelosi of the testimony to Kavanaugh over the Senate Court chair on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and refused all charges that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the opening speech to Kavanaugh, he was very emotional and sometimes cried out with lumps in his throat as he spoke of his family and years onward.
He criticised the Democrats in the Committee, calling the charges against him “gross and a planned attack on his reputation,” organized by liberal politicians who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves he can't serve in the Supreme Court because it shows that he's prejudiced against democrats.
\"I believe that the way he behaved in disqualifying him, and what he said about the Clintons and Democrats,\" she said.
Pelosi objected when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh off if he was elected to the Supreme Court, and if the Democrats gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
\"I can say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he can't serve in the Supreme Court, nor in the court he's turning now,\" added Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is a judge of Washington D.C.'s federal appeal court.
Pelosi also said that as a democrat she is concerned about potential judgments from Kavanaugh against the law known as Obamaare and the case of Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative judge.
In his hearings to confirm Kavanaugh, he avoided answering questions as to whether he would turn certain decisions in the Supreme Court.
\"It's not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person in the Supreme Court who expects us to say he's great,\" said Pelosi.
And women have to swing the sword.
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of rage, and she can't get it out without crying.
“We wept when we are angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
'I don't think it's unusual, do you think?'
She continues, \"I received much help from a woman in a high corporate position, who said that she branch when she was angry, but developed a technique where she told the person who made her so angry that she branched, \"You might think I'm sorry because I cried.
I am angry.\"
And then it just keeps going.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears act like a way to get the mind out, but many people misunderstand.
In one of my strongest memories of a former job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I sense anger, and a woman older than me took me on my neck — she was a cold leader for whom I had always been terrified — and pulled me out at a time.
\"Never let them see you cry,\" she said to me.
'They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and they watered because they made you cry.\"
Patricia Schroeder, who at the time was a congresswoman, a democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, Hart was taken to be trusted on a boat called Monkey Business, and withdrew from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought that she might as well make choices as president himself.
'I hadn't really thought it through enough,' she said to me while she laughed 30 years later.
\"There were already seven other candidates who made choices, and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Some people call the situation Snow White and the Seven dwarfs.
Since the campaign had already taken place for a while, it had not collected enough money, so she promised it would only be silent if it were able to collect $2 million.
It was impossible.
She discovered that her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
\"Do they think I'll get a discount?\" she asked.
When she declared that she would not make choices anyway, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and aim for the voices instead of the delegates, and anger against sex discrimination, that she began to cry during the speech.
\"You should have thought I had a nervous breakdown,\" Schroeder said about how the press responded at the time.
\"You should have thought that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I wonder, what are they going to write on my tombstone?
‘Ho branch’?
How the trade war between the United States and China may be good for Beijing
The opening balance of the US - China trade war was desert waters, and while the battle continued, a tear between the two countries may be one advantage for Beijing in the long run, says experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump shot first shot this year at taxing important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The battle escalated this week, with tariffs on articles worth over $200 billion, which in effect means that half of all goods from China to the United States are taxed.
Beijing has taken home and set tariffs of between five and ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States for every shot they fire off, and the second largest economy in the world will most likely not end with the first.
To get Washington to stop, China has to do as the United States will, but bowing to the United States is too embarrassed for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Yet, experts say that if Beijing keeps its head cold, the American pressure can have a positive effect on the long - term Chinese economy by reducing the degree of dependence between the two economies.
‘The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Beijing can cause both economies to fail is more dangerous than people have dared to admit earlier,’ said Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for American Security, a thoughtmie.
Syria 'ready' for the return of refugees, says the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says they are ready to accept refugees who will return voluntarily and ask for help to rebuild the land that has been destroyed after more than seven years in war.
When he spoke to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said that the situation in the country is making progress.
\"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,\" he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas damaged by terrorists in order to regain normal areas.
All governments are now in place for refugees to return voluntarily to their country of origin from the ground of terrorism and unilateral economic measures beyond their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian government would accept help to rebuild the damaged country.
But he stressed that they will not accept assistance or help with conditions from countries that sponsor the rebellion.
Europe secures saying in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 as they beat the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 in Le Golf National Outside Paris, France.
The USA has now lost on European soil six times in a row, and they have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown of that team to the Danish captain, Thomas Bjørn, reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson cut most of the tournaments and hit the ball in the water from the tee at Hol 16 par 3, and therefore gave the word to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari did well in all his rounds and became one of four players who have ever received 5-0-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5/64 of the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's tallest rank, was 2 and 1 after Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who divided eight Ryder Cupar, became the most winning European with 25.5 points in the career.
'Of course I didn't heal, but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
How grateful Thomas chose me to trust me.
I'm so, so happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help,\" said an emotional Garcia after the European Says.
He's turning the stick on to landman John Ram, who beat the American golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in single game on Sunday.
\"I know a tremendous pride in beating Tiger Woods, I am raised to look at him,\" said Rahm (23).
Woods lost all four of his fights in France, and now has a merit list of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup up through the career.
A remarkable statistic from one of the world's best players, which has won 14 big titles and is only turned on by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team went off to find the fairway all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who impressed with high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, the U.S. Captain, said after a disappointing display from his team, \"I'm proud of these queers, they fight.
There were periods this morning when we made it hot for Europe.
We fought.
The hat for Thomas.
He's a stand-alone captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with PGA in America and our Committee on Ryder Cup and get on with it.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
One has to take off his hat.
We were beheaded.”
