AM in Wales is worried to “be a puckon...
Some AM, members of the Wales National Assembly, are confused about a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Wales Parliament).
The proposal comes after plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the parliament of Wales.
AM throughout the political spectrum is worried about being ridiculed.
An AM for Labour said his group was worried because \"it rhymes with Twp and Pwp --
For readers who can't Welsh: Twp means stupid in Welsh and pwp means poop.
An AM for Plaid said that the group was generally dissatisfied and has proposed other options.
A conservative walere said that his group is \"open\" for the change in name, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W is spoken in Welsh like the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently putting together legislation for the change of name, said: “The final decision of what members of the congregation should be called is clearly up to the members themselves —
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh congregation the right to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the Assembly for the Wales Parliament.
In respect of the title of AM, the Commission proposed Welsh Parliament Members (Members of the Wales Parliament) or WMP, but MWP received the greatest support in a public consultation.
AM suggests other options, but problems with reaching a consensus may cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the amendment within a few weeks.
The regulatory framework for the amendments also includes other changes in the way the assembly works, including rules for disqualification of an AM and the design of the comitology system.
AM may vote on what to call them when debating legislation.
Macedonia shall hold a referendum on the modification of the country's name
On Sunday the voters will vote if they change the country's name to \"Republic of North Macedonia\"
The referendum is an attempt to end a dispute that has been going on for decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has for a long time insisted that the neighbouring country's name represents a claim in its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the referendum on the change of name and has said that he will ignore the outcome.
However, the referees of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of names is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's goblins when the churches in Harlem come across trouble
Old people I'm talking to say there was a bar and a church on every corner of the day said Mr. Adams.
Now there's neither, nor...
He said it's understandable that the bars disappear.
\"People hang out in other ways these days,\" he said.
\"Bars are not like the area's living room anymore, where people go on a regular basis--
In the case of the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be sufficient as far as the leaders expect and that, sooner or later, they will end up on box one again.
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with real estates filled with people who do not help remaining churches.
“The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white,” he said. “This will eventually lead to all the churches being closed down, because those who move into the apartments will probably not be members of the churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had a nearby church took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black assembly led by pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott by shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when the pastor Johnson Assembly planned the renovation they also built the clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the music game \"the poor bells\"
The expert who played the bell game in July had another name for it: “A cultural treasure — and an irreplaceable historical instrument —
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world’s first bell game played by a black musician — Dionisio A. Lind, who moved on to the larger bell game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
The events of the last few months at St. Martin's are a complicated story with architects and entrepreneurs - some hired by the church's playthings, others by the Episcopal Foundation.
The Church Meeting - the church’s governing body made up of laymen - wrote to the founder in July and expressed a concern that the founding would “try to transfer the cost ” to the church general meeting, even though the church council had not been involved when the foundation hired architects and entrepreneurs.
Some congregation members complained of a lack of transparency from the foundation.
Shark is hurting 13-year-olds who dive after lobsters in California.
Last Saturday a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who appeared after lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack took place just before seven o’clock in the morning, near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shout for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he at first thought that the boy was only happy to have found a lobster, but then he realized that the boy screamed: “I have been bitten,
I've been bitten.
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he noticed that the entire keybone had been torn up.
“I called out to everyone to get out of the water. ‘There’s a shark in the water!’,” said Hammel.
The boy flew to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition indicated to be critical.
It's unclear what sharky it was.
Bad guard captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim suffered trauma on his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's entering Britain's beauty market
Sainsbury's gets on Boots, SuperDrug and Debenham's with department store-like beauty walks with beauty specialists.
As part of a significant push into Britain's beauty market at £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the decline of the fashion and household markets, the larger walks of beauty will be tested in 11 stores across the country and implemented in more stores next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the supermarket's attempt to fill the shelves previously raised by TV sets, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said they're going to double their beauty offering to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing selections from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space with selected areas, as in stores like Boots.
The store chain also re-launchs its boutique brand so that most of the products are vegan, which many young customers demand.
In addition, the perfume reseller Fragrance Shop will test stand in two Sainsbury's shops - the first stand opened in Croydon, southern London last week and the second one will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend to buy smaller amounts of food every day in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their stores will look increasingly like department stores in an attempt to fight cheap shops like Aldi and Lidl with more services and products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos-stand in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitat stands since they bought both chains two years ago, which according to them has increased the sale of food and made the acquisition more profitable.
The former attempt by the supermarket to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a facelift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a dispute as to how the revenues from Boot's sales in the supermarket would be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, who owns Lloyd's Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
They argue that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an extended range of luxurious skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial manager, said: \"We have given our walks of beauty a new look and a new feeling to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can advise customers.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all needs, and with an attractive environment in smooth places, we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping,
Peter Jones-Rassing - after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the deal of £11 million
Dragon Den-star Peter Jones is “Rassing” of the fact that TV representative Holly Willoughby withdraws from a deal of £11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
Their business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop.
This Morning representative, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons Den-star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their luxurious lifestyle brand at the last minute, to focus on his new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, at a tense meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday, when the TV favorite admitted that her new contract - worth up to £1.5 million - she no longer focused on their brand True, with leisure clothes and accessories.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and expected to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she left Truly on Instagram, Jones flew to one of her holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly was clearly Holly’s top priority.
It would be her long-term future for the coming decades.
Her decision to withdraw shocked all those involved.
No one could think it happened on Tuesday, so close to launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold at the headquarters in Marlow -
Experts believe that this Morning representative's decision to withdraw can cost the company several million because of significant investments in everything from pillows and candles to clothes and the risk of further delays in the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Three-child mom Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role as chairman in March.
The couples are vacationing together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production companies.
Willoughby is going to be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the I'm a Celebrity on ITV.
A source near Jones said last night: \"We don't comment on his business.
And then we fell in love.
He joked that the media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider to be unworthy a president - and that he was so positive about North Korea's leaders.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a “news address ” voice:
I haven't given up on anything.
He said that Kim wants a second meeting after Trump celebrated their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been under way.
More than three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diploma Ri Yong Ho said to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a “equivalent response” from the United States after North Korea's first disarmament step.
He noted that the United States, instead, continues sanctions designed to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his followers.
- He said North Korea's doing great.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship.
He said that his attempt to improve the relationship with Kim has had positive results - an end to rocket tests, freed hostages and returned remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this full-packed arena, we'd have about 200 people here-- said Trump and pointed to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake ruin island in Indonesia, hundreds die
Following the earthquake at Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population had lost their homes, it was not called an emergency permit, which is required for international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they are not asking for international help, which complicates everything,” Ms. Sumbung said.
Save the children gather a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear if foreign staff can work there.
Mr Sutpo, the natural disaster agency spokesman, said that Indonesian officials evaluated the situation in Palu to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the aid work.
In view of Indonesia's constant earthquakes, the country is still miserablely unprepared for the wrath of nature.
It has been built tsunami protection in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The absence of a tsunami in Palu, even though a warning had been issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions, it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that has been anchored in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure in its election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and trains.
But poor funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration for next year's elections.
Mr Joko is also under pressure by continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christians and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, bows, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge announced last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute in Stamford Bridge, London, on Saturday.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal when his team was behind with 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick at the away pole.
The experiment flew high across the target area towards the upper right corner of the network.
The ball finally fell over the hope of Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended up in the net.
“I just tried to end up in a position to get to the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
- I saw Kante approach and didn't think much about it, but I just kicked...
Chelsea led with 1-0 after the first half after a goal in the 25th minute from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker poured a passport back to Mateo Kovacic, spinned off near the middle field and sprinted to the Liverpool side.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go by the middle field.
Then he received a great kick that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard ran from the defense and got the ball in the net at the far pole with a left foot kick past the Liverpool Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday.
Chelsea is opposed to Videoton in the Uefa Europa League in London at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday.
Tsunami mortality rate in Indonesia rises to 832
The death rate for the earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people were reported to have got stuck in the ruins of buildings that had fallen in the earthquake of 7.5, which struck on Friday and triggered waves of up to six meters, said the firm’s spokesman Sutpo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380 000 inhabitants, was full of brutes from buildings that were falling apart.
Police arrest, 32. Suspected of murder after a woman is cut to death.
A murder investigation started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 p.m. with a knife wound on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police have asked people in the area who saw or heard something to come forward.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: \"We are at an early stage of the investigation, but I ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information essential to our investigation -
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived at the place to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police inform the victim's closest relative.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but the police said no one can get in or get out of the building.
He got speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents of the building have been informed that it will take several hours for them to come back in.
A police assistant told a man that the whole area is treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared on the spot.
She says, \"It's so horrible - over and over again.
At 14:00 a.m., there were two police cars inside the lockdown and another just outside.
A number of police assistants were inside the lockdown with an overview of the apartment building.

Parliament's statue of Cromwell's latest victim of arguments about rewriting history
A banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal \"badge\" and try to write about history.
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be drawn into the ongoing debate on removing statues,
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
The wrong Cromwell might be sacrificed for what his forefather Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the opinion of the 19th century and is part of historiography for a man whom many consider to be still to be hailed.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Many, perhaps more in the late 1800s than now, consider that Cromwell defended Parliament against outside pressure, in his case from the monarchy.
If this is a proper representation, it is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has undoubtedly affected the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person representing one side of the matter.
His achievements as a lord protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated.
Murder pig kills a farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, who was only identified with his surname Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood in a path on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post this Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccine into pigs in a pigpath on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He is reported to have travelled with his cousin from neighbouring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a pigpath nearby was open.
He told me there was a big pig hen in the snout with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic study confirmed that the 250-pound pig had killed the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and twisted,” said the cousin who was identified with the surname Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 this Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to avoid more attacks while the police collected evidence on the site.
Yuan's family and market participants are reported to negotiate compensation for his death.
It's rare that pigs attack people, but it's happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and caused serious damage to the man.
Ten years ago, a pig of 300 kilos pushed a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “catalyst”
They're just playful.
They're very curious, they don't want to hurt anybody.
You just have to show them respect, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa for extensive heavy rain to the Southwest
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it travels over cooler waters on the north coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flooding rain to northern Mexico and southwest America in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind force of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at 5 EST in Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a train is formed across the Pacific Sea and is traveling east towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula Baja California as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture north into the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching tree will create vast rain in the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, clay flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5-7.5 cm of rain per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5-10 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the Southwest, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly impaired conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is certainly not recommended that someone go into the desert on foot when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into flowing rivers and thunderstorms lead to strong local winds blowing around sand.
The approaching tree may bring local heavy rain to parts of the southern California coast.
It is possible with a total of over one cm of rain, which can lead to mud streams and tail roads.
It would be the first rain in the area during the rainy season.
Some skingrade tropical rains will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more extensive later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October can mean intense temperature changes throughout the United States, when the Arctic cools down but the Tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes at short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in central America on Sunday.
There is almost ten degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of the Central and Eastern United States are expected to get a warm start on October with about 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of the North-East.
New York could get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about five degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a great chance of warmer temperatures than the average in the Eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million watched Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation
Over 20 million looked at Thursday's arresting testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault that was supposed to have taken place in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued and the normal shipment was interrupted for Friday's last minute-twist - Arizona Senator Jeff Flakes' deal with the FBI where they got a week to investigate the charge.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she's absolutely sure Kavanaugh kept silent on her when he was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said he's absolutely sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers last Friday was higher than the 20,4 million reported by Nielsen.
The average number of viewers calculated at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other TV networks that showed the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has problems counting people looking from offices.
Comparely, there are as many viewers as for a football match in the playoffs or Oscarsgalan.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, had most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long interrogation, according to Nielsen.
ABC had the second most of them with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.44 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still high after the hearing.
Flake was the focus of Friday's drama.
After the Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS filmed protestors screaming at him when he tried to take an elevator to an interrogation with the Jewish committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the demonstrators yelled at him, as was shown in the live broadcast of CNN.
I'm standing right in front of you, said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They also said: \"You have power when so many women are powerless,
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors were closed he said he would have more to say after the hearing with the committee.
The TV networks sent live several hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted if they would pass on Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the entire Senate.
But Flake said he was only going to do it if the FBI were to investigate the charges against the nominee over the next week, which the minority democrats have claimed.
Flake was partly convinced by his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to the Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flakes' decision had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of “political games” around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for political games - about the future of Britain and to undermine the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's customs duties was “fully unreasonable”
The Shooting of Wayde Sims: The police arrest suspected Dyteon Simpson for the LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and arrested for murder, said the police in Baton Rouge.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost his glasses in the battle.
Police found the glasses on the spot and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After questioning with Simpson, the police said that he confessed that he shot Wayde to death.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to Advocate.
The coroner in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a bullet wound in the head and into the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police escape forces, the police state legal lab, Southern University police and residents in the area for assistance with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their \"continuity and the pursuit of justice\"
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98-metre-long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
Last Friday, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said that the team had been crushed and shocked by Wayde's death.
“You’re worried about things like this all the time,” said Wade.
Volcano ash over Mexico City
Ashes from the Popocatépetl volcano have reached the southern part of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned in Saturday’s Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity had been discovered in the crater and the registered 183 emissions of gas and ash over the course of 24 hours.
The center discovered several mules and tremors.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ash on windscreens in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano 72 km southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police are meeting with Catalan separatists for the anniversary of their independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after the protesters of independence struck together with the riot police while thousands participated in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on secession by Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists held back by the Krallpolis threw eggs and color powder on them, which led to dark ponds on streets which are usually full of tourists.
Fights also broke out later in the day, and policemen used their batons to stop them.
For several hours, the independence groups “never forget, never forgive — while the Unionists cried out —long live Spain —
14 people were treated for minor injuries caused by the protests, according to local pressure.
The atmosphere is still tense in the region, longing for independence one year after the referendum on the first October which was considered illegal by Madrid but was hailed by Catalan separatists.
An overwhelming majority voted in favour of independence, but participation was low when most who opposed the election bojkotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1 000 people were injured in violent conflicts last year when the police tried to stop the vote at election stations in the region.
Independence groups camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but had to take another route.
Elektron Narcis Termes, 68, took part in the protest of separatists with his wife and said that he no longer believes that Catalonia will become independent.
Last year, we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy in being able to vote, but now we've stuck - he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal gain in regional elections in December, Catalan parties who are for independence have had difficulty keeping the momentum up this year, as many of their most well-known leaders live in self-inflicted exiles or are in custody waiting for trial about their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his mobile phone, said that the conflict had been set on by politicians on both sides.
- He said it's getting more excited.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been arrested since the end of last year, announced that he will be running for next year's elections.
“Walking to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the understatement we have experienced from the Spanish Government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after cars drive into houses

Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
A crossbow may also have been fired against the car.
Menga gives Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured profits
Livingston shocked Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss of 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mengas's strike turned out to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was split in two with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side still hasn't won a win in Premiership this season and meets Hearts, with eight more points, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers Rapid Vienna in the Europe League will welcome on Thursday.
Livingston extends his payline to six games - head coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against cross visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before they scored; their fairness gave Rangers all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his performance across the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could just shoot wide after gliding in to measure Craig Halkett's nodding across the goal.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could attack in certain games.
And that is how the decisive goal was made.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to give Menga a chance, which scored from the centre of the target area.
In that situation, the Rangers had dominated the ball, but the home team's defense was impenetrable and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely left alone.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Ranger's goalie Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot wide from another of Livingston's determined games.
Crossings constantly entered Livingston's target area and were handled without any problems. Two penalty demands — after Halket's challenge by the exchanger Glenn Middleton and one by hand — were dismissed.
“Penomenal — From Livingston — Analysis”
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal display and results for Livingston.
Each one was outstanding and continues to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their playing style and staff have barely changed since they returned to the upper level, but Holt deserves the honor of galvanizing the team since their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a well-organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell straight through.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their moments under Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball did not last the measure - they only opened the home page once - and it is part of a wake-up watch for the Rangers, which is in the middle.
Erdogan gets a mixed welcome in Cologne
Saturday the smiles and blue skies were on Saturday (29 September) when Turkey's and Germany's leaders had breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - to repair the relationship between the NATO allies.
They have become attuned to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world's largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed that they prevented 25 000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many followers gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators - many of them Kurdish - also heard their voices and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to Germany.
The duelling protests show the fragmented views of a visitor who is considered a hero of some German Turks and condemned as a one-violence ruler of others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in crash by car
A biker has died in a crash with a car in London.
The hook took place near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-run road in Deptford, southeastern London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and the nurses were called there, but the man died at the scene.
The hook takes place a few months after another biker died in a refugee accident on Childrens Street, about 1.5 km from the crash last Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said they're trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Roads have been blocked off and buses have been redirected and drivers have been asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in thumb
Six prison guards have been injured in a high security prison for men, according to Prison Office.
The disorder broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and is still going on.
Specialized Torna Dockers have been called there to deal with the unrest, which involves eight prisoners on a wing.
The guards were treated in place for minor damage to the face.
A spokesperson for Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison staff have been sent there to handle the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for damage.
We are not tolerating violence in our prisons and are clear that those who are behind this will be brought to the police and may have increased prison sentences.
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, riot police were called to prison to deal with serious unrest in which staff were attacked with poolballs.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City by flood (dry areas can benefit)
It is rare that tropical low pressure reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves forward over the desert in the Southwest, with the risk of sudden flooding.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings of sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, and bring rain late on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of the Arizona border -
National Hurricane Center's latest models predict 5-10 cm of rain, with isolated quantities of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwestern United States, including central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, probably get 2.5-5 cm of rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without the risk of sudden floods, Rosas rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Flooding is very serious, but some of the rain will probably be beneficial because the Southwest U.S. is suffering from drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reported weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first travel across the peninsula Baja California, Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane force this Sunday morning with a maximum wind force of 135 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and traveling north in 20 km/h.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, which calms it down.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico’s land mass as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico can get heavy rain, which represents a significant risk of flooding.
The total rain is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm - reported weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm and reach Arizona's border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
“The greatest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very heavy rain in Baja California, the northwest Sonora and the desert in the southwest of the United States,” said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening floods and mud streams in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three boys in their teens and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST last Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the situation is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, said the police in Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking anyone who could have filmed what happened to his cell phone to come out.
Trump says Kavanaugh led, evil, anger - from the democratic party
“A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party,” said Trump to his followers in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered from the evil, anger of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified to the convention last Thursday and denied strongly and emotionally Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he sexually molested her several decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified before Congress about his accusation.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people saw the brilliant, the quality and the courage — at Kavanaugh that day.
“A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most skilled legal minds of our times, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public,” he said to his followers in the audience in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about the importance of Republicans voting in the coming mid-electures.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
He said I can't do it, but I can do it.
That's why I'm going around fighting for sovereign candidates.
Mr Trump claimed that the Democrats are trying to resist and hinder
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to information provided to CNN by an assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number rising
At least 384 people died, many were swept away when gigantic waves crashed against the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities of Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu on Friday when up to six meters high waves crashed towards the beach in the dusk and swept out many to a safe death and destroyed everything in their path.
Tsunamine came after an earthquake of 7.5.
“When the tsunami warning came yesterday, people stopped on the beach instead of running immediately, and they fell victim to the tsunami,” said Sutpo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesia disaster agency GDPB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
“Tsunamine was not alone but dragged cars, logs and houses along the way,” Nugroho said. “Tsunamine had traveled on the open seas for up to 800 km/h before the hit coastline.
Some climbed up trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Photos released by the emergency agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and have collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
After-shock still hit the coastal city last Saturday.
The line of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesia Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology BPPT stated in a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake last Friday was 200 times the atomic bomb released on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made the tsunami larger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the destruction as “wide” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found during the crash of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and injuries could be even worse along the coast line 300 km north of Palu, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
The communication from Dongala was completely paralysed without any information, Nugroho said.
“There are over 300,000 people living there,” said the Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse, they said.
The firm was criticised on Saturday for not informing it that the tsunami had struck Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had appeared within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is heard screaming frenetic warnings about the tsunami to people on the street below.
Within a few minutes a wall of water will crash towards the beach and sweep away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and the tsunami led to a massive blackout that interrupted all communications around Palu, which made the rescue work difficult for the authorities.
The military has started sending cargo flights from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated people are still in great need of food and other supplies.
The city airport has been opened for relief work and remains closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Employees from the World Vision in Dongala have made it to Palu where they seek protection during tarpaulins at the farm outside the office, but they saw destruction along the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
They said they saw a lot of broken houses, he said.
It's very bad.
Support teams have started the major assistance work, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and employees from abroad may be used only if an exemption permit is issued after a disaster.
This has not yet happened.
“It’s still a regional disaster,” said Auli Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the authorities say it’s a national disaster, we can let in international aid, but that status has not yet been announced,”
When the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of missing people were still hoping that their loved ones would prove to be the miracles that brighten dark natural disasters.
Last Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday rescue workers rescued a woman who had been stuck under fire for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, Indonesia's National Screen Flying Team coach, had trained two of the missing screen pilots in front of Asian games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
As a paramedic, I have my own emotional burden — he said.
Mr. Gendon told me that the hours after the screen pilots heard that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he desperately sent whatsApp messages to the Palu participants who attended the beach festival.
But his messages only got a gray bock, instead of two blue.
I think that means the messages weren't delivered, he said.
Thieves take $26 750 during the ATM refill at Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning the thieves stole $26 750 from a Brink's staff who filled a ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The car driver had emptied a ATM in the entertainment facility and would deliver more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While he was busy, another man sprung up behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
According to the press release, the Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on the identity of the perpetrators shall contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rappers change their name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes name - to Ye.
He announced the name change on Twitter last Saturday and said: “The creature that is formally known as Kanye West —
West, 41, has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title of its eighth album, which was released in June.
Name-change is coming before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yidhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the program, which set out for “sensitive reasons” — according to the programme’s creators.
Ye is a shortening of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious significance for him.
“I think that ‘yes’ is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” said West earlier this year when he talked about the title of his album with the radioist Big Boy.
- So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means 'only', to only Ye - a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a mirror of who we are...
He's one of a number of famous rappers who've changed their name.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, which has previously collaborated with West, has previously written its name with and without hyphens and capitals.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico recently elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the military against civilians now that the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody retribution against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza last Saturday to never use the military to oppress the Mexican people,
Tropper fired weapons against a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968 and killed up to 600 people during an era when left-wing student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans with monthly grants to students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and inadequate educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
USA should double AI funding
Now that China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research in the field, according to the inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment comes after several parts of the US government have made statements about AI, despite the fact that the US does not have a comprehensive formula AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of becoming a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for the next breakthrough within AI,” Lee said.
A double that large budget can double the chance that the next major AI breakthrough will be made in the United States, said Lee to CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was previously published in the month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most outstanding AI companies — Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that hit the highest rated American Othello player, and later he was in charge of Microsoft Research and was CEO of Google’s China department.
Lee mentioned previous technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as Robot Challenge from Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what next would be to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government, says Lee.
“It’s not China that takes the academic leaders from us, but the companies,” said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed leading university personalities to work on AI.
Lee said that new immigration policies can also help the United States with the AI innovation.
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctoral students within AI,” he said.
The State Council in China issued its development plan for the next generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation grants funding to people at academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organisations handing out money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
American legislation that would create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not made any progress in months.
Macedonian referendum on change of name
Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum on the country's name to be changed to \"Republic of North Macedonia\", which would solve a decades of old dispute with Greece which has prevented its attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, claiming that the name of its northern neighbours is a requirement for its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but Nationalist opponents argue that the change of names would undermine the identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority.
President Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts if the minimum 50% participation required for the referendum is to be considered valid.
The question on the ballot in the referendum is: \"Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU with the agreement with Greece,
However, the supporters of name-change, including Prime Minister Zaev, argue that it is worth renaming if it enables Macedonia, one of the countries that was formed when Yugoslavia was split, to join the EU and NATO.
“I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they intend to follow the outcome in order to be considered decisive.
The exchange of names requires a majority of two thirds of Parliament.
According to the State Electoral Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 13 o'clock.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last Parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I am voting for my children, we belong in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in the Macedonia referendum on the country's change of name, which would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia 30 September 2018.
Outside Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents that have been set up by those who boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and Europe, but we want to take our heads in the air, not sneaking through the back door,” Kavardarkov said.
We're a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asian integration -
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership of NATO would lead to much needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
“I think the absolute majority will vote ‘yes’ because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said when he voted.
He said that one \"Yes\" result would be a \" attestation for our future\"
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies, between 30 and 43% of voters voted in the referendum, which falls below the minimum attendance required.
According to another survey by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of the participants were voting on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them were going to vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be counted, 50% of registered voters plus one vote will have to be taken.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious backlash of the Western-oriented government's policy since it took over in May last year.
Look at: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero is going through all of Brighton's defense to make a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's win at 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian striker got a pass from the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and went into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around a defender and ran from several others at the edge of Brighton's target area.
Then he pushed a pass to Sterling to the left.
The English forwarder used his first kick in the target area to return the ball to Aguero, who used the right foot to beat Brighton's goalie Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
\"Aguero has a problem with his feet,\" said City's manager Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
- We talked about him playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that moment,
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial takeover at the Premier League game.
The target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's remir on that game.
He sent off a nice kick along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple kicks and led Sterling to the away pole.
Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net moment before it ended up out of reach.
City meets Hoffenheim in the group game of the Champions League at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from the playoffs, so there was no need to force one to the start.
But competition-oriented Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only about Rockies, which is located a game ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still has a chance to finish the game.
Rockies got a wild card place with a win of 5-2 over the Nationals last Friday night, but is still looking for his first division title.
“We’re playing about nothing, but we can get a chance to rub rubber in the knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the other team would play at higher level than any other team I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be there?
Nationals have not announced their starting point for Sunday yet, but according to reports they lean against letting Scherzer throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, heated the noise last Thursday and would throw on his normal resting day.
Washington's right-handed pitchers are 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 inserts this season.
Trump is making a speech in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he talked about how important it is for Republicans to vote in the forthcoming mid-term evaluations.
- Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the great, great... I can't do, but I can do it. That's why I go around fighting for sovereign candidates.
Trump continued: “You see a terrible, terrible group of radical democrats, you see it happening here and now.
They are determined to take power back no matter what it takes, you see their wickedness, their terribleness.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take over power and control. That's what they want, power and control.
Democrats, he said, struggling to “stand up against and prevent...
You've seen that for the last four days, he said, and he called the Democrats angry and mean and horrible and false.
He mentioned the Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, who sits at the Senate Jewish Committee, which was met by the high-rising from the spectators.
Remember what she said?
'Did you leak the document?'
'Eh, eh, huh?
No, no, I'm expecting a ...' It was really bad body language, one of the worst body language I've ever seen --
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They don't tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a series of MPs from Labour who are told that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament Joan Ryan was treated in a similar way when she faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe - ironically similar to Jeremy's previous leaders.
In the communication on the meeting with Nottingham East Labour this Friday, it said that \"we want meetings to be welcoming and productive\"
For most of my eight years as Labour's local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been exactly that.
But now, unfortunately, many encounters are not, and the promise of -more friendly, more gentle - politics has been forgotten long ago, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly apparent that deviant views are not tolerated within Labour, and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether the party's leaders accept it.
This started immediately after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues whom I thought before had a similar political view that I expected me to make a complete conversion and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed to - whether it was the national security or the European internal market.
Every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - a tens of wetts of social media that require me to be deposed, criticize my own policy and say that I shouldn't even be in Labour.
And this doesn't just hit me.
The fact is that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that are directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the professionality and determination of these colleagues when they face a stream of sexist and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the greatest disappointments of this policy of yours is the level of insults now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, however, we are no longer this broad church, and with every distrust and change in the selection rules, the party is becoming increasingly narrower.
I've been getting a lot of advice over the last two years about flying under the radar and not being too straight, so it's ordering itself...
But that's not why I became a politician.
Ever since I joined Labour as a school student 32 years ago, provoked by Thatcher's government neglect which literally caused my primary school classroom to collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most - both at local level and as Minister of Government.
I have never hidden my political views, and that includes the latest election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused by my views on policies and subjects where I do not agree with the current leadership.
To you who promoted the claim last Friday, I just want to say that when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services, I do not understand why someone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour Party leaders.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency - Labour members as well as others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threat of deposing me or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Oslagna Ayr on top
Two attempts at the last minute may have distorted the result a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Championship match.
They are now on top, the only unladen side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, that gave the home team the prize, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested during our games so far and are still unladen, so we’re of course happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: \"Ayr deserves it; they took better chances than we did.
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr management but a yellow card for Scotland's Captain Rory Hughes, who was released by the Warriors for the game, let Melrose let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's leadership with a penalty, and at the end of the first half he scored and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead of 17-5 in the pause.
But Melrose got a good start on the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was converted by Baggot, reduced management to five points.
It was then a long wait for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the plan, and after the restart Ayr management increased again with an attempt from Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting Captain Blair MacPherson then got a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of cool pressure.
But the home team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the penalty line out behind Ayrs maul.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent away the flanker Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt of the home team.
Still Game star seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems ready to enter the restaurant business after it was discovered that he has been appointed CEO of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old, Jack Jarvis, plays in the BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays together with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemhill.
Duo has announced that the coming ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to plan for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's CEO of Akakmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source at the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to enter the Glasgow-flower restaurant industry
“The sea belongs to us”: Kustlös Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific again
Seamen patrol a rigged headquarters for the fleet of La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue flag.
The Navy bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon carry the motto: “The sea belongs to us.
It's our duty to recover it.
In coastal Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still strong - and there is also a longing to sail again on the Pacific.
This hope is higher than in several decades now when Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on the first of October, after five years of reflection.
“Bolivia has the operation, a atmosphere of unity and peace, and certainly awaits the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the international court’s decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will judge in favour of Bolivia’s demand that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, has to negotiate with Bolivia to allow them to take their own way to the sea.
Monday's decision also has a great deal of importance for Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president, who is facing a controversial re-election struggle next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts think it is incredible that the court is judging Bolivia’s advantage, and that much would not change even if it does.
The United Nations Court of Justice, based in the Netherlands, does not have the right to assign Chilean territory and has suggested that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision is announced only six months after the final arguments indicates that the case was not ‘not complicated’ said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years may have been more damaging than promoting Bolivia's chances.
“The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
She claims that Morale's aggressive rhetoric has drained Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, did not consider that the Court's decision had been taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given an outstanding opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile - and a chance to - put an end to 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit - he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the issue of the sea as a political crucible.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific,” he said.
The decision is a chance to realize that we have to move on from the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament demands confidence in the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that the nation will not arm its nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the two rival leaders.
His comments came when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of solving the deadlock of nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a \"desirability\" to continue sanctions and US protests against a statement that ending the Korean War will ever subjugate North Korea.
Washington hesitates to agree to the statement without Pyongyang starting up significant nuclear disarmament first.
Kim and President Donald Trump both want another summit.
But there is widespread scepticism against Pyongyang’s really going to get rid of an armory that the country probably sees as its only chance of guaranteeing its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line huge headgear on the way to shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a selection of tricky, oversized headgear for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which dazzled the stylons at Paris fashion week.
Amazingly intrudered hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designers have sent off their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino's main creation was an excessive beige hat with a feather-like wide hat brim that completely took over the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a wizard hat and even a pineapple — but they are not intended to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre worms, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had joined lips and rather resembled Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a wet suit with a loop and a dive mask, and another looked like a melted glass slide.
And if you continue the enormous courage, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hoods may be on their way to shops near you.
The oversized hats come shortly after La Bomba - the straw hat with a brim of 60 cm that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratakowski.
The cult brand behind the incredibly intractical hat that has taken over social media sent out another great creation on the catwalk — a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the swimsuit held in it.
The Rafia bag in the terracotta, with electrofiafransar and a white leather handle, was excellent in Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris fashion week.
Kändisstylist Luke Armitage said to FEEMAIL: \"I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the shops next summer - the designer has had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories -
John Edward: Language skills critical for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain outstanding academic achievements and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, which are only strengthened by individual and collective advances in sport, art, music and other community engagements.
With up to 30,000 students in Scotland, schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement adapted curriculum, we see modern languages continue to be popular and requested subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's test results show that languages are at the top of the list, with a maximum of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign - language students received the final Higher Grade A test.
Data collected from SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 per cent of those studying Mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French, and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages that vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages such as subject selection are now considered to be as important as natural knowledge, technology, engineering and mathematics on curriculum in independent schools and beyond.
A study conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills 2014 concluded that employers had difficulties filling their vacancies for various reasons, with 17 per cent attributed to a lack of language skills.
With this said, language skills become all the more necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs requiring language skills, these skills are becoming necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of their career choice, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries, automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adults British published by YouGov 2013, 75 percent said that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation in it, and where French was the only language totaling up in a two-digit percentage (15%).
It is therefore so important to invest in language teaching for our children.
Being able to speak several languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance to find meaningful employment in the future.
In Scotland each school will teach different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important for Britain before 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and have them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In a global economic environment, it is undoubtedly languages that remain crucial for the country's future, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as “international communication ability”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
I faut bien le faire.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Lakersdebut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who look forward to seeing LeBron James make debut for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's first season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he plays has not yet been decided.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” said Walton on Laker’s official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers’ preseason schedule.
-I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to get ready,\" he said.
Trumps West Virginia Promotional Events, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is doing his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five planned performances next week, including events in places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Pending a confirmatory vote by its candidate for the Supreme Court’s vacancy, Trump aims to build support for future mid-term elections, as the Republicans risk losing control of the Congress for the forthcoming November elections.
What time is the Trumps West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trumps Wheeling, West Virginia campaign events are scheduled for 19:00, tonight Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trumps West Virginia-Rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to deal with this week's interrogation of the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, who was excited by accusations of his sexual abuse, with an expected delay in voting from the Senate for up to a week while the FBI's investigation of the case is ongoing.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help the Republicans get some meat on their legs before November elections.
Thus, President Trump said that these five assemblies next week aim to “engage volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the hectic campaign,” said a spokesman for the Trump campaign who did not want to be named Reuters.
The night’s events, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh’s media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has fallen behind in the public opinion polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come there to try to give him an increase in opinion polls,” says Simon Haeder, a state scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA fights to keep hopes alive for Sunday's singles
After three unilateral sessions, the couple competitions in Saturday afternoon could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The motion's swinging pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but something that the players really believe in, and more than ever before, before competitions like these.
So what moment is this about now?
“They had a six point line and now it’s four, so we wear it as a small moment I guess,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points of advance with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have a little wind in the sail, but they have much to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and combed home three points out of four were.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to green and is a good example.
The wine trope balded even higher as his round continued and he lowered a decisive putt to take the game four all-square when he and Thomas had been behind by two after two games.
His Putt who won them the game of 15 met with a similar roar, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
“You really need to dig deeply and worry about your own game,” said Spieth.
That's all that all these players have left now.
18 holes for victory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's unquestionable story.
Europe's odd but adorable couple are four from four and now nothing can go wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who didn’t make a bogey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back down the ninja on Friday morning.
These performances and audience reactions state that they are players to beat on Sunday and there are no more popular players who could come home a potential European win when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Representing both, simultaneously in different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, along with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on front nine lowered the Spanish and Swedish into a hole they never even got near to crawling out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you out of the hole.
Four ball and foursome are so fascinating to look at closely because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a law so far and taken a significant lead before the last day, but this foursome session also showed that the Team United States has a struggle that some, especially on the side of the United States, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup the last day
Europe will have a strong advantage on Ryder Cup's last day after coming out from Saturday's four ball and foursomes matched with a 10-6 lead across the United States.
The inspired duon Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two wins over a siege Tiger Woods and combed home as many as four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European law, which fought to keep the cup they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American law that never really got started in the morning's 3-1 lightball.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursome and won two games, but that was not enough for victory.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single matches to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, named \"Molliwood\" after a sensational weekend is just the second couple to win four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup's history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a fireball, they beat an exhausted Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more stringent 5 & 4.
Woods, who went through two games on Saturday, showed a sample of single moments of brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fireball and foursome, and hence seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning's four-ball and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 & 1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe did not have a partwind all the way, but it was a pleasant, windy day just southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the landmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They brought home the victory with 2 & 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four ball and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in the foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history, one team has come back from a four-point underposition in the single matches, however Furyk's side just needs an undecided result to keep the cup.
After being the second best for two days it looks like a counterattack on Sunday can be difficult to get through.
North Korea says they'll ever disarm unilaterally without confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations last Saturday that continued sanctions deepened their distrust towards the United States and it was not possible that the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation’s Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant steps to demonstrate its goodwill, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, removing installations for nuclear tests and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technologies.
“We do not, however, see a similar response from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to an approach divided into stages for the nuclear power that would result in North Korea’s reward as it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant, since it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution, as Pyongyang had previously done.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a seated American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work towards the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has been looking for a formal end to the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first dispose of its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also turned down negotiations to relieve severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on the first round of settlement — and increases the pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose by coercion and even object to the “declaration to end the war”,” Ri says.
“The notion that sanctions can get us on our knees is a wishful dream for those people who lack knowledge of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that U.S. leaders highlighted in the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korea’s leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the party to this issue of nuclear disarmament had been South Korea and not the United States, the Korean peninsula’s nuclear disarmament would not have reached such a deadlock,
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's future ability to reach the US mainland with rockets was inevitable after \"Mr. Evil President\" Trump called Kim a rocketman on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened “to destroy all the North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take action for disarmament, but said that much work remains to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeframe for this and said that “if it takes two years, three years or five months — doesn’t matter,”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: \"The maintenance of Security Council sanctions must continue with force and without failure until we realize a complete, final, verified disarmament--
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to suffocate the funding of Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri at the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made. North Korea, however, accused him a few hours later of asking-gang-like demands-
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear crisis complex if the United States took similar measures,
He said that Kim had told him that the \"equivalent measures\" he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and moved towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has led all doctoral students to improve their sleep habits in an effort to combat the growing macho culture to study through caffeine-filled “dysurias”
An academic study found that students at the world's leading universities are often careless about the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after discussing the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
- At the end of that, a girl came up to me and said, \"Why can't I know this until now, in my last year,
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was organised for the first time this year, explains to students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improves their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University's Health Services, said that the University decided to introduce the course after discovering that the students suffered from severe sleep failure during the week.
The hourly course covers a range of interactive tasks.
In part of the course there is a picture of a student room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another part, participants are told how long-term sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that it will not change the behaviour of students directly.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes, - Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in that “deepness” still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on the students meant that sleep scarcity was a growing problem.
To ensure that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's “secret weapons” to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain because insomnia puts the brain in a state of hunger and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiar studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course and has read one of his courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course was an eye opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before they start their studies at the high-performance department.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” issued by electronic screens and LED lighting, which may turn you around in the daytime, resulting in in fallback problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengas target lowers Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered yet another loss today when Dolly Mengas strike sent Steven Gerrard's uneven side to a 1-0 bottom team in Livingston.
The Ibrox page was looking to take home its first win on the road since February 4-1 triumf on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his team eight points after the Ladbrokes Premiership leader Harts.
Menga hit to seven minutes before half-time and Rangers never managed to smooth out the result.
While Rangers now fall down to the sixth place, Livingston climbs to the third and is just behind the Hibernian on target difference.
And there may be more problems on the floor of the Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a main year after an object was thrown from the far end.
Gerrard made eight changes to the semifinal of Betfred Cup.
Holt on the other hand went with the same Livi 11 who took a point of Hearts last week and he would have been happy at the way his well-made game exceeded the opponents every time.
Rangers must have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
It should have been a goal already two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass released through Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his big shot and shot outside.
A deep-fried kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached since captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the rear pole.
Rangers took control of the game, but it seemed to be more hope than faith in their games during the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelo surely felt that he should have had punishment when he and Steven Lawless crashed, but Judge Steven Thomson wavered the Colombian call.
Rangers managed to score only two goals in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly readily received Lassana Coulibaly's nick and a domestic kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Lily opening shots in the 34th minute may have gone against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their kneeling deserved it.
Again, Rangers failed to handle Jacob's permanent situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher looked after Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the exchange gave almost immediate effect when the outer edge hit the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block the experiment.
But Livingston continued to get the opponents to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett which swept up long pass after long pass.
Holt's side could have strengthened his leadership at the last stage, but McGregor did manage to stop Jacobs before Lithgow nodded off the corner.
The Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton had yet another late demand for punishment when he was beat with Jacobs, but once again, Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now one page from Sunday’s calendar: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today...the day of the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm-Hans-Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geigerometer.
Geigermeter has become the foundation of science since then and is also great in pop culture, as in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado” with the leading role in the seemingly unlikely Cowpoke researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
MAN-What on earth is that?
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger meter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms produced by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: “Yes, it pops now.
He died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see — cancer cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then-see - a protein that is common to many cancers and then re-injected
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognise cancer, saw her ovarian cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can “see — a protein common to many cancers called HER2 and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: \"Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine
HER2-promoting the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and teachers - the way one targets cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA cap, after his SNL performance.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was buffed out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a slumping appearance praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying that he himself would be running for the post in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he was wearing a Make America Great caps, he railed against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
-So many times when I'm talking to a white person, they say: \"How can you like Trump, he's racist,
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago, he said.
The SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon where the Hollywood Star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's judicial committee about the charges of sexual abuse made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it was not broadcast, the playback of West's performance on social media was loaded by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to drive West with the post.
West had also complained to the audience that he had been harassed backstage for his headbond.
They bullied me backstage.
They said, \"Don't go out there with that hat on.
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm falling low, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: \"Do you also want to lower low--and said he'd put my supermancape on, because that means you can't tell me what I'm allowed to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Test With Love
His comments attracted more burop at least twice from the audience and employees from the SNL seemed genated, reported Vriety. One person said: “There was a death stake in the studio.”
West had come in as a late substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with their appearance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the Conservative Group of TPUSA, Candice Turner who tweeted: “To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU TO DO TO THE MOBBB
But the host of the chat show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West simply “was itself and it’s absolutely wonderful —
“But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his art — who I think embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
So are we. She added.
Before the show told the rapper on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now the creature previously known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapparkolliglig, Snoop Dogg has called itself Snoop Lion and of course the deceased musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Doom for attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been accused of attempted murder after a man stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, said the police.
The defendant is expected to attend the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington beats toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his sword-throwing role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has said negatively about the stereotype of macho hero and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thinks that \"something has gone wrong\" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her fellow actor in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also she 31, admitted that he knows \"very strongly\" to deal with the problem.
“I personally feel pretty strong, right now — where have we gone wrong with masculinity,” he said.
How have we raised men in view of the problems we see now?
Kit believes that TV may partly be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued “What is native, and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they must be in a certain way to be a man?
I think it is really one of the great issues of our time - how do we change it?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men -
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do any Game of Thrones followers when the series comes to an end next summer and says that he is ready with battlefields and horses.
From November, Kit will play in a new recording of Sam Shepards True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks that the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience from Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife thanks to the show, so it gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, in which Kit's character Jon Snow falls in love, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family owner in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820 000 people have been affected in the country, says the health authorities.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through six and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV is spread rapidly through certain parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected by HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people from year to year.
HIV infection through intercourse is an urgent issue in China's HBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminated in China in 1997, but discrimination against HBTs is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men sooner or later will marry women.
Many of the cases of infection are due to insufficient protection at the time of intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses that staff leaked the data of the GOPsenator, hides on “hazardous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
The US congressman Maxine Waters condemned on Saturday claims that one of her employees had posted personal data on three Republican American senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Demokraten claimed that these claims were spread by extreme right-wing websites.
“Ligs, lies and more reprehensible lies” said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The released information reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers for Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing about the charges of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Water's office and released the information about a member of Waters staff, reported Hill.
“This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie,” continued Waters.
My staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims - were in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie.
Water's statement quickly got criticism online, including from the White House's previous press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is angry,” wrote Fleischer.
This suggests she doesn't have the temper to be a member of Congress.
When accused of something they did not do, they must not be angry.
They can't be defiant.
They must not question the motive of the doubter.
They must be calm and sensed.
Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water's response to the democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of having seemed angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who candid to devote Waters in the middle of the current term, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
- Much about true - he tweeted.
In her statement Waters said that her office had warned — appropriate authorities and law enforcement about these fraudulent demands.
\"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed,\" she continued, \"and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions which are destructive and dangerous to all my employees,
Recension by Johnny English Strikes Against - powerless spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit benefits in every new film with British tilt, and the same seems to apply to this re-recording of the latest Johnny English action comedin - a series of spy-parodys who were kicked off in 2003 with Johnny English and got new life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the satir of what manifestly bad we are to become the nation's new export product?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his rubber face has got his license to screw things over for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation for biopublic even in non-English-speaking countries
Of course, he's the crazy secret agent, who, despite his bizarre claims of smoothieglamour, has got a little bit of Clouseau, a grunt Mr Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the Olympics in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There are one or two nice moments in the latest JE film
I loved when Johnny English approaches a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the rotor blades struck his helmet for a short time.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is displayed, but the humor feels quite low-counted and strangely redundant, especially since the “serious” movie brands such as 007 and Mission Imposible themselves now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels as if it's adapted to children instead of adults and to me Johnny English is not as strange as Bean and focused as Atkinson's silent film-bravades.
The constantly topical issue is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the United Kingdom's super-secret web network of spies, which exposes the identities of all UK agents in the field, to the agent in the service's great dissatisfaction - an extremely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last straw for a prime minister who is a poppy and hard-working figure, who is already suffering from a complete collapse of his political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing his very best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but the script does not offer much to work with.
Her intelligence adviser informs her that when every single active spy is busy, she must use someone who has retired.
And that means the tribal Johnny English in person, now employed as a teacher of any wealthy institution, but offering unofficial lessons in the art of working undercover alongside.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his previously long-lived sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, a jolly-hock-sticks-roll where Vicki Pepperdine is near waste.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terribly wrong with Her Majesty's Secret Service and comes across Olga Kurylenko's beautiful female fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister will fall hard on the charismatic tech-billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain's computer failure: the unfortunate Jason Volta, who is played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odyssey of Farstaded Appetizers: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury boat; and English trigger pure pineapple when he tries to use a VR headset to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta's house.
There are certainly a lot of jobs behind the last sequence, but even though the film is both charming and fast, it has an air of children's TV around it.
Pretty moderate everything.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can't help but think: couldn't British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour deny that a plan is being drawn up for British to work a four-day week but get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's party Labour is considering a radical plan that the British work a four-day week - but get paid for five.
The party claims that managers hand over savings made through the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but keep the same pay.
According to sources, the idea would fit with the party's economic agenda for the benefit of the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A senior representative in Labor told The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be published by the end of the year.
“It will not happen in one day, but a four-day working week is an effort that fits into the party’s attitude towards balancing the economy in favour of the worker and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, even the Party of The Greens who promised a four-day working week during its election campaign in 2017.
However, this objective is not endorsed by Labour as a whole.
A spokesman for Labour said: “A four-day working week is not the party’s policy, and it is nothing the party agrees on —
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said that he was determined to take power back from unintentional leaders and snores on state companies.
The shadow chancer's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies cannot get their entire stake back, because a Labour government can make “deductions” because of what they perceive has been wrong acts.
He also confirmed plans to put workers in corporate boards and to create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds where 10% of the private company’s equity is transferred to its employees, which will then receive an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy report in the TV program “60 minutes” about whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the Agency's investigations could cause any Republican senators to change their position on the matter.
In an interview sent on Sunday, the 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would lead to their changing their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his partner from South Carolina.
Kennedy said.
I told you when I went into the hearing, I've been talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, the claim came out, and said, \"Have you done it?
He was determined, convinced, unmistakable.
Graham’s voice, however, seems unshakable.
He said, \"I've already decided about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynami tank.\"
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it, - added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And all her names couldn't verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormously impressive display of stars and an equally impressive mission; to fight world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to the Central Parks Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event: to fight extreme poverty before 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, according to a 2012 statement, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international pre-language group that hopes to fight poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you were not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or actions, such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling or other meaningful ways to raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizens been with 12 years to reach their goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just about so-called “clicktivism” people who feel they make real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen states that more than 19 million documents have been registered - from its supporters who have fought for a variety of goals.
It says that these measures have helped to spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies that correspond to more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The Group estimates that the funds collected so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the UK between investors and actors who are committed to \"helping children to develop to their full potential - promising to give Rwanda 35 million dollars to help fight malnutrition in the area after getting more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make social injustice as malnutrition is a footnote in history,” said the ambassador for the partnership Tracey Ullman to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 measures that require Britain to improve the diet of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes diet programmes targeted at 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the usual questions on its website: “What makes you think that we can fight extreme poverty”
Global citizen replied: \"It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartite movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who perform this year's events in New York, the hosts of which are Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use its fleet in a 'blocked' to prevent Russian energy exports, says the Minister of Home Affairs.
The government may, if necessary, resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy players from entering the markets, including the Middle East, has revealed the US Home Minister Ryan Zinke, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria - especially where it appears on the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, Europe’s southern parts,” he said.
And according to him, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The US has the ability to, with our fleet, make sure that the shipping routes are kept open and, if necessary, apply blockades, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants in the event organised by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group calling themselves the voice of the energy consumer in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they really were the same.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia as a “dayly country” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Opinions come after the Trump administration has aimed at increasing the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of the Trump Administration, including President Donald Trump of the United States, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the inappropriate North Stream 2-pipeline project, which according to Trump made Berlin Moscow prisoner.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of 11 billion dollars, which is to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
They argue that Washington's opposition to the project is only driven for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and consumers’ choice of suppliers,” said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American position was backfired by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has encouraged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I strongly dislike the fact that a third party is disrupting our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a \"ordinary thinker\" if she's going to run for president 2020, says Massachusetts's Senator.
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a “ordinary thinker” about her participation in the presidential election after the United States mid-term elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider setting up as a candidate.
“It’s time for women to get to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman on top” she said, according to The Hill.
\"After 6 November, I'm going to take a great thinker to run for the presidency...
Warren weighed into President Donald Trump during the council meeting and said that he was taking this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m deeply worried about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been free-speaking in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said, \"We need, of course, an FBI investigation before we vote,
However, a vote that was released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own supporters did not believe that she would be able to do so by 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of the-Faith-Malchusett's voters said that the senator should not be able to do so, according to a study by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% for a potential candidacy and 48% against.
Other highly-profiled democratic names that are discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26th, spent a year in Iraq after recruiting in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
“What my own son is going through, what he is going through now when he’s back, I can relate to other families who have experience of PTSD and part of the trauma our soldiers are returning with — she said to the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest for the elephant in the room, and said about his son and other veterans that they'll come back like other people, they'll come back hardened, they'll come back and wonder if there's respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and pilots and all the other members of the military have given the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and accused of domestic violence against a woman, attempted to prevent a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in drunk state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, as well as the District of Columbia, support the questioning of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial trial aimed at a new American policy denying asylum to victims of gang violence or violence at home.
Representatives from the 18 States and the district submitted a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the claimant in the case Grace v. Sessions submitted by the American Civil Liberals Union in August against the policy has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner — and his violent gang members — abused her, but American officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The lawyers of the states who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries that produce a large number of asylum seekers, such as nations that face major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy amended a decision of the 2014 immigration authorities allowing illegal immigrants to seek asylum in order to escape domestic violence.
The District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law”
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances to which the claim applies, and such a provision is contrary to that principle, according to the Friend-of-the-court report.
Lawyers further argued in the report that policies that deny immigrants' entry harm the American economy and argue that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and to deliver the necessary labour,
Minister of Justice Jeff Sessions ordered in June judges in asylum cases no longer to grant asylum to victims who fled domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asyl is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a certain social group or political opinion,” said Sessions when the policy was announced on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems - including all the serious problems - that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the death rate is doubled in the pursuit of survivors
For the survivors, the situation looked worse.
“It feels very excited,” said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted his beautiful boy in a evacuation center in the city of Palu.
The ambulance is picking up dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is a commodity
The inhabitants were seen returning to their ruined homes, rooted through water-damaged possessions and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, injured in the 7.5 earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who was affected by a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the hospital Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continued strong aftershock.
With tearful eyes, he said that the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
We couldn't escape.
I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, I think — Haris told the Associated Press and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it kept quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of bullying with propaganda adverts
One week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four - page ad in an American daily newspaper on the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the American ambassador accused China that Peking used the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily paying an extra in Des Moine's Register - the state of Iowa's best selling magazine - after accusing China of trying to participate in the US's 6th Congressional election, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in American elections marked what American officials told Reuters where is a new phase in an escalating campaign from Washington intended to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Peking and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war with elevated tariffs on each other’s imports.
China's retribution tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in States such as Iowa supporting the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Peking had injured American workers, farmers and companies.
China, written Branstad in a discussion article on Sunday's Des Moines Register, \"now doubles the bullying by posting propaganda ads into our own free press,
“The government of China uses America’s dear tradition of freedom of expression and free press to spread propaganda by publishing paid advertising in Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
“In contrast, in the news desk on the street here in Beijing you will find a limited number of differing votes and will not see any true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have on China’s troubled economy, because the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party with an iron hand,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China's most outstanding newspapers was nobbling the offer to publish — his article, even though he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans scare away female voters for the mid-term election through Kavanaugh-fiascott, warn analysts
Since many top republicans defend the Supreme Court’s nominated Brett Kavanaugh who faces several charges of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a setback, especially from women, during the forthcoming elections.
The feelings about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the elections.
It is not possible to turn back the clock,\" says Grant Reeher, professor of Political Science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published last Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)' last attempt at an FBI investigation will suffice to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November,” says Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to Washington, DC.
On Friday morning, the protesting-November, as they demonstrated in the hall to the Senate building, when the Republicans who control the judicial committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go into the roof,” said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, for the news site.
People say it's already loud, that's true.
But it could be higher, especially among women indecisive voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote
Even before Ford’s public testimony with charges of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate of the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a setback could follow if the Republicans pressed through the confirmation.
“This has become a confused mess for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It is not just about the Committee’s vote or final vote or whether Kavanaugh is coming through, it is also about how Republicans have dealt with this and how they have dealt with her,” said Guy Cecil, head of Priorities USA, a group that helps democratic electoral campaigns, for the news channel.
But the Americans in general seem to be divided over who they should believe in in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, and the latter seems to be the one they believe in most.
A new opinion poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied under his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, as well as those of at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford witnessed to the Senate Court Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh violently attacked her at age 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court exposed her sexual organs while attending a party during their time as a student at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of World Wide Web plans to start a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of World Wide Web, launches a startup aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The most recent project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people get access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is “world domination”
We have to do it now, he said about the startup.
It's a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own online data store- or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all are available in a browser simultaneously.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it is completely up to the user who can access any type of information.
The company calls it \"personal authorization through data\"
The idea with Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some programme developers to work with the project and a group of volunteer codes.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to \"Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are placed on the high side overnight.
We do not ask their permission.
In a post at the Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994 Berners-Lee became the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality in recent months.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about this new era on the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest rewarded with Viktoria cross during World War I is celebrated
The only priest in the Church of England who was rewarded with a Victoria cross during World War I is now celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his action during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was never told that he had been awarded the most prestigious prize of the British military.
A memorial was unveiled by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was \"Brilly\" symbolic that the stone would be exposed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded with the prize.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin — through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns —
He later rushed up to the line of fire and led with \"great bravery\" the line forward before he alone decided the battle.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were something I know I could never live up to, but something I'm very humble about--
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he “felt very honored to play a role in the parade — and added that “a real hero’s against is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people —
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and instead got to watch Greta Gris
Imagine this, you've stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 just to be denied watching the main event.
The show from San Jose included 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown live at night in the UK on channel 5.
At 06:00, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the program suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were not impressed after keeping awake to the early morning hours to watch the game.
A fan on Twitter described the program change to a cartoon child program as “a sick joke”
“It was the government’s decision that the content was not appropriate so early in the morning, so they had to switch to child programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president for marketing and communication when asked about the broadcast.
-Greta pig, yes.
Bellator’s CEO Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to better include British viewers in the future.
“I think we’ll be able to find a solution with regard to the rerun, said Coker.
“But there are six in the morning on a Sunday there and we will not be able to solve this to Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the program shift upset a lot of people.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was really a government issue.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will show five games instead of sex - as we normally do. We took water over our heads in our efforts to satisfy the fans.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he felt inferior to his comrades during his childhood because of his sexuality - but it also encouraged him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize he wasn't like everyone else until he was in high school.
When he spoke in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals in order to give others-hop-
He also said that he cared less about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The popular show's regular programme manager, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off because of illness.
During his one-time performance on Laverne's first program, Daley tells how he felt less worth than others during his childhood, because \"it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls\"
He said: “This feeling of feeling less worth and feeling different has been a real source of the power and strength to succeed,
He wanted to prove that he was someone, he said, so that he didn't betray everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medallion has become a high-profile proponent of HBT rights and used its appearance at this year's Common Games in Australia to convince more countries to decrime homosexuality.
He said he took the floor because he felt he was lucky to be able to live openly without restrictions and wanted to give others-hop,
The three-time world champion said that his love for a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - came as a surprise.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age — he participated in his first OS as a 14-year-old and his father died of cancer three years later — he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age with similar life experiences.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Dayy, and Daley said that his whole life perspective had changed.
- If you'd asked me last year, it was only about winning gold, he said.
But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie.
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that Dad did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about were if they received their tickets to the Olympic Games in London in 2012 - where he wanted to sit on the first row.
- I couldn't tell him: you won't be able to sit on the front row Dad, he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally admitted he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at OS 2012 and won bronze.
I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - to dive in front of a home audience in an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling,\" he said.
It also inspired his first song - Proud of Heather Small - a song that had followed him up to the Olympics and who still gave him the shakes.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will score on Sunday when he plays his 47 Ryder Cup match, but then he has to fix the shape to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four-balls and four-somes.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he has often been for the United States, the five-fold winner spent his day between acting cheers and practicing on his game in the hope of having a chance to show off his ability.
He has never been the straightest of drivers, not even on top of his career, and the 48-year-old is not in shape in front of the tough track on Le Golf National, where the long bus often punishes hard.
It's not just the banana that discourages, in the ninth game on Sunday, Mickelson meets the champion Francesco Molinari, who, together with the novice Tommy Fleetwood, won all four games this week.
If the Americans, which are 4 points in front of the 12 single match, have wind at first, Mickelson’s match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say much more.
“He totally understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on his back and put his arm around me and said that he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
His confidence is nothing wrong with that.
He is a celebrity and he has added so much to these teams in previous seasons and during the past week.
I probably didn't think he'd be able to play two games.
I thought he could do more, but now it's the way it is, and we have to settle for it.
He wants to be out there, just like everybody else.
On Sunday, Mickelson passes Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never fully lived up to the heights of his individual results.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk said his presence brought other qualities team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, smart, likes to joke with people and he’s a good guy to have on the team,” he explained.
“I also think the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds so much more than just games--
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can soon be a memory alone
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in the last day's singles in Ryder Cup can quickly change into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made her debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a team under Seve Ballestero's leadership held a five-point advantage over the Americans but finally won with the smallest margin with the result 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You are reminded that we led a great deal at Valderrama, we led a great deal at Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with distress and little,” said Bjorn (in the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and lead with 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will prove to me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow we give everything.
Go out and do everything right.
This isn't over until we see the point on the board.
Our goal is to try to win this podal and that is where our focus is.
I've been saying that all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we're well aware of what's waiting on the other side - the best players in the world -
Björn was satisfied with the performance of his players on a tough golf course and added: “I would never manage this myself.
Tomorrow, there will be new challenges.
Tomorrow it is the individual achievements that apply, and that is a completely different matter.
It's fun to be out with a partner when you're doing well, but when you're out there on your own, your capacity as a golfer is fully tested.
It is the message you need to convey to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner behind you, and he must also go and get the best out of himself,
Unlike Björn, opponent Jim Furyk will want players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who came home three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of major conversions during the last days in a competition, both on the winning team at Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe drove -Miracle at Medinah -
“I remember every fucking word of it — he said in reply when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to go out as fast as on Brookline, as on Medinah.
When the pace starts to run on one side, there will be a lot of pressure on these mid-matches.
We made our show and placed the guys we wanted to, you know, create some magic tomorrow--
Thomas had the task of trying to lead the fight and meeting Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
“I joined this group of guys in this order because I think it is enough all the way,” said Bjorn about his single choice.
Germany’s new warship is being delayed again
The German fleet's newest frigate would have been launched in 2014 to replace warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will not be launched until at least next year due to incorrect systems and high costs, reported local media.
The launch of the “Rheinland-Palatinate” ledship for the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg fregates has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel should have joined the fleet as early as 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery were disastrous for the ambitious project.
The four boats in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen fleets.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and maritime missiles, as well as some sneaking techniques, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the newest frigates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships - which allow Germany to project power abroad - are already obsolete when they are put into operation, writes Die Zeit.
The fateful F125 fleet created headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to operate the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the return, but the German media indicated a number of important “software and hardware errors” that made the warship useless if used on a battle mission.
The failure of the software was particularly important because ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a staff of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older Fregatters in the Bremen class.
It also appeared that the ship has a significant overweight, leading to impaired performance and restricts the marine capacity to perform future upgrades.
The 7 000 tonnes of heavy-duty Rhineland-Palatinate is assumed to be twice as heavy as similar vessels used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from the faulty hardware, the entire project price tag - including training the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have gone to fraud EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - compared with EUR 2.2 billion at the starting stage.
Problems affecting the latest frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany’s maritime power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the fleet should actually be given a lack of fully equipped ships.
The official said it was a growing problem because old ships were decommissioned but no replacement vessels were provided.
He regretted that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust Stealers to the Secret Life of the bats
New research carried out on a property in the highlands of Scotland aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help control future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the South and Dwarf Pilistrell as well as the brown borrowers and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important places around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat sound and the species that do what.
A bio-environment map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area view of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of life management work such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forestlands for bats and other related species.
Flounder populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have decreased considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by building and development work that affects the well-being and loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting may also pose a risk, as well as aircraft and certain chemical treatments of building materials and cap tax attacks.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technology to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
The organisation has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out investigations, examine the nest and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at the Three Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property Manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal area for them.
- Here at Three we have a good area for bats, he said.
“We have the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and a host of favorable habitats.
But there is a lot about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other property helps us understand more about what they need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of searching for bats before performing maintenance in real estate, as it is possible that accidental destruction of a single nest could kill up to 400 females and young people, and possibly wipe out an entire population.
Fladder mice are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, trouble or disturb them or destroy their nest.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species we don’t know how their populations are.
Ronaldo rejects the rape sentence while his lawyers threaten to sue the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called him the rape charges against false news, saying people want to market themselves by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375.000 to keep quiet about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live video on Instagram, Ronaldo (33) turned off the reports as “false news — when he spoke to his 142 million followers, just hours after the demands were reported.
No, no, no, no.
What they said today was false news,\" said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
They want to market by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything good - said the player and smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over claims, which they have called an unauthorised reporting of suspicions of integrity, according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for \"moral damage to an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years,
The alleged event is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where they reportedly raped her anally, according to documents submitted at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged event and told her that he was -99% - a \"good guy\" - betrayed by the \"last percent-
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was with consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed on a conciliation because she felt “feared for retribution — and was worried about being“ humiliated publicly”
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to cancel the settlement because she continues to traumatize by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: Great Britain - always regrets - losing car manufacturers
Great Britain - would regret it forever - if you lost your position as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was “oroan” that the Topotecan UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, they will temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
Clark said we need an agreement.
The Japanese car manufacturer announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event of no agreement being concluded could result in lost jobs.
The Burnaston factory - which manufactures auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which was exported to the rest of the EU.
“My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stops in our factory,” says Marvin Cooke, the CEO ofdoita at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems with car manufacturers are the risks to the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without settlement.
Topotecan’s production line is run on a ‘just-in-time’ basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for ordered cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could lead to disturbances at the border, as the industry says, could lead to delays and a lack of elements.
It would be impossible for Topotecan to keep more than a day's consumption in stock at its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and hence, production would have to be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequer's plan for future relations with the EU is -exactly calibrated to avoid border controls -
“We need a deal. We want the best deal that allows, as I say, not only success at the moment to be appreciated, but for us to take this opportunity,” he said to the BBC Radio 4:s program Today.
“The statements from not only the Tootova but other manufacturers are that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains”
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that increasing costs would reduce plant competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the leader of the Unite Trade Union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly worried: \"My experience is that these jobs never come back.
One government official said: \"We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU,
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump’s meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could “be shot in another week — while the fight against the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continues,” said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work of special advisor Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian involvement in the elections, relations between Trump and Russia and the President's potential obstacle to justice.
Whether Trump will kick the Deputy Minister of Justice, thereby jeopardising Mueller's independence, has been fueling Washingtonskvaller for months.
Earlier this month the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a listening device to record conversations with Trump as well as the possibility of deposing the president via the 25th addition of the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, and reports that he would resign appeared.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would \"precious\" not to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate judicial committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual irregularity, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein she said: “One date for it has not been established, it can happen this week, or a delay by one week, considering all other things that happen at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date.
Some reporters would question the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
The values Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to any disapproval of TV reporters playing for the gallery, even though she said: \"I agree with the fact that they are playing for the gallery,
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
“The president holds more questions than any president before him,” she said, adding without quoting proof: “We have looked at these figures.”
Conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this often and you have seen us do a lot over the last few weeks and it will replace press conferences, and you can then ask questions directly to the President of the United States.
Trump answers questions regularly when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances before the assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes to employees from the EU in NHS Scotland, taking into account concerns about Brexit
The Minister for Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish that they stay behind Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of closed status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public sector.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on exit have continued, with regard to decisions that are expected to come this autumn.
However, the British Government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I value the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve health care work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here--
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after he suffered head injury
Tennessee State Tigers lineback Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after having suffered a head injury in Saturday's loss with 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennessee's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Reed told the reporters that the damage occurred just before mid-term.
“He came to the sideline and just collapsed,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on a stretcher for further evaluation.
An agent from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center Hospital.
Harris added that “there is no information on the type/intensity of the injury yet — and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a biennial Redshirt student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before he left the game, which gave him a seasonal number of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers may pay higher stamp tax when purchasing property in the UK, and the extra money is used to help homeless people, according to Tory's new plans
The measure should neutralise Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The British Ministry of Finance expects to collect up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers should be allowed to pay a higher stamp tax when purchasing property in the UK. The extra money should be used to help the homeless, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The measure will be perceived as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises of housing with more affordable prices and to aim for high income earners.
The increase of the stamp tax will be taken out by individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the UK. The extra money will give a boost to the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional charge is higher than the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in recreational dwellings and dwellings purchased for rent, which may be up to three per cent.
The Department of Finance believes that the measure will withdraw up to £120 million per year.
An estimated 13 per cent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by people living outside the UK, which drives prices up and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot on the housing market.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital city, have become ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new playoff will only come a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the stamp tax to help more young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up allowances in housing with affordable prices to resolve the poor situation in the UK -
Jeremy Corbyn has launched sufficient proposals for house reform, including rent ceilings and an end to eviction without the tenant’s fault.
He also wants to give municipalities more opportunities to build new housing.
Theresa May says: “Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, that life should be better for every new generation.
This means solving the problems in the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and also for companies based abroad, to buy housing as for hardworking residents in our country.
The dream of owning a home has become too many people just a distant dream, and homelessness remains an invaluable fact.
Jack Ross: \"My ultimate goal is to train Scotland
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his \"final goal\" is to ever become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old shots look forward to the challenge of blowing life into the club from north-east England, currently located on third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light last summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a match in the B team and that's all Ross says to the BBC Scotland Sports Sound.
“But when I grew up I looked a lot at Scotland at Hampden with my dad, and it has always attracted me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage to run a club...
Among Ross representatives for Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of the Alloa Athletic says that he was not worried about succeeding so established names in such a large club. He has previously refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Just now I consider success based on the answer to the question ‘Can I get this club back to the Premier League?’
This club definitely belongs in the Premier League, given its structure and talents,\" he says.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I’d probably just see myself as a success here if I could get the club back there —
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a period as an assistant trainer in Dumbarton and a 15-month visit as a member of Hearts Training Team.
Then he helped Alloa get back from moving down to the third division, and lifted St Mirren from being near down to becoming the winner of the championship title the following season.
Ross says he's more satisfied now than ever during his gambling career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkyrk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a crossroads — he remembers and refers to when he took command of Alloa.
“I really thought that leadership was absolutely right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had good results and I could live well on it, and I also had some great success.
But playing can be tough.
There's a lot you have to get through every week.
There is still stress and pressure at work for me, but training feels quite right.
I've always wanted to practice and now I do. I feel better than I've ever done in my entire adult life -

A survey shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
The heat wave of the summer has increased revenue for the country’s fighting pubs, but the restaurant chains have been under greater pressure.
Figures showed that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of the CGA company, which has compiled the figures, said: “Continued beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in the World Cup longer than expected meant that we had to see a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the pubs went up by 2.8%. However, restaurants had even greater difficulties.
The decrease in restaurant turnover by 1.8% in June was only worse in July.
Pubars and bars offering drinks above all showed the best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pubars offering food also found it difficult in the beautiful weather, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink something.
The trend towards managed pubs and bars went up by 6.6% that month, and food sales decreased by 3 %.
Paul Newman at the service and entertainment industry analyst RSM says: “These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sporting events are still the main factors in the sales of large kitchens.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups still have difficulties, although a sales reduction of 4.8% per year is particularly difficult to deal with in addition to current cost pressures.
The long warm summer could not have come more inconvenient for companies driven by food sales. Time may reveal if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August give someone much needed feedback.
The total sales increase in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2,7 % in July, reflecting the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub bar and restaurant industry in the UK collects and analyses data on the progress of 47 active groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One in five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
A study shows that one in five children, sometimes as young as 11 years of age, have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school and upper secondary school students shows an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
The result has increased concern that sexual content is posted there
20% of the students reported that they had a master account, which they showed to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years of age, creates accounts on social media that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school and upper secondary school students showed a rapid increase in the number of ‘false Insta accounts’, a reference to the Instagram Image Sharing Service.
The result has shuddered at the concerns that sexual content is being posted there.
20% of the students stated that they have a clean main account, which they can show to their parents, and so they also have private accounts.
A mother who tripped over her 13-year-old daughter's secret page found a teenager who called on others to \"cease me.\"
According to the study, which was conducted by the organisations Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistress Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools, 40% of the children had two profiles between 11 and 18 years of age, and half of them acknowledged that they had private accounts.
The president of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to create places on the internet where parents and teachers can’t find them —
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the athletes - in the board of the Scottish Friadrotts Union, the Scottish Athletics
Eilith Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as an external member of the Board of Directors at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most prized free rider, and President Ian Beattie describes the election as an outstanding opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her wide experience at international level for the past decade.
“Eilidh has gained great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that the sports in Scotland would benefit greatly from her becoming a member of the board,” says Beattie.
Doyle says: “I would like to be a voice for the athletes and I hope that I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland”
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, has four Olympic gold and is now an expert commentator on the BBC. He lost the ability to go for a mini stroke.
He writes on Twitter: “Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time would tell me to recover, and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I've recovered completely, learned to walk again and now I'm doing mobility exercises!

A company that sells breast pumps has caused differences on the Internet with an ad that compares nursing mothers to cows that get milked.
In order to pay attention to the launch of what is said to be the world’s first silent portable breast pump, the consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video-inspired advertising film with a humorous look to show the freedom the new pump gives mothers pumping breast milk.
Four real moms dance in a jug full of cows to a song with lines of lyrics like: “Yes, I milk myself, but I don’t have tails — and if you didn’t know it, this isn’t a udder, but tits —
The reflection continues: “Pump out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies...
But the advertising film, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused a fight on the internet.
The film has received 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, and has met mixed reactions from the viewers. Many say it throws light over the dairy industry’s phases.
“A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Just like us, they must become pregnant and fed in order to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them only a few days after birth - writes a person.
Elvie breast pump can be carried discreetly in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comments: “You can see that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But certainly, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who may keep their children -
Another one adds: “What real-life-reversed advertising films. —
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is \"hysterically funny\"
I think this is brilliant.
I would have gotten one if I was still nursing.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product - writes someone.
Another comments: “This is a funny advertising film that is aimed at mothers who pump (often at the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like ‘cossors’.
This isn't a film that celebrates or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the film, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump stuffed in the closet.
The concept behind the campaign is based on many women who pump milk saying they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no cables or pipes and can be carried discreetly in a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin is a partner and ECD at Mother, and she says: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women who pump breast milk and dairy cows, we wanted to put light on breast pumping and the challenges with it, while in a entertaining and easily recognizable way we show the incredible sense of freedom of the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump creates headlines.
During London's fashion week, a two-child mom appeared on the catwalk with clothes of designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp near the border in Texas
The number of deprived migrants has shot up, although the number of people crossing the border is relatively unchanged each month, partly because of the hoarding of rhetoric and hard politics introduced by the government Trump has made it more difficult to place the children in reference persons.
In the past, most reference individuals themselves have been undocumented immigrants, saving to put their own opportunities to stay in the country at risk by declaring themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult household members would have to leave fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Office, testified before the Congress that the government had arrested dozens of persons who had applied to be reference persons for single minors.
The Authority subsequently confirmed that 70% of those arrested were not known by law enforcement authorities in the past.
“Nearly 80% of those who are either reference persons or family members of reference persons are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to persecute these individuals — said Albence.
In order to deal with children's cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring certain of them to appear in the court within one month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, as was the case in the past, according to staff at the premises.
Many of them are present on a video link rather than on a personal basis in order to bring their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not deemed to be entitled to protection are quickly deported.
The longer children are deprived of liberty, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to staff in the centres and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Proponents say that concerns are rising in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is more likely to be ignored due to the size of the facility.
They add that if children are moved to the tent town without having enough time to prepare themselves emotionally and say goodbye to friends, they can exacerbate the traumas that many are already wrestling with.
Syria demands that US, French and Turkish occupation forces withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and will be dealt with accordingly,
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that the “war against terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that the government of Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until we have freed all Syrian territories — both from terrorist groups and from all illegal foreign presence —
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war - torn country.
As regards refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances are good for them to come home, and accused “certain Western countries — to spread irrational fear — that cause refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return,” he said.
They're policing something that should be a purely humanitarian matter.
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel attachment Idlib has created an opportunity to proceed with political talks.
The Russian-Curric Agreement ruled out a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had — clear deadlines — and expressed the hope that a military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaida-connected Nusra front, who — will be wiped out —
The UN Senator Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of government members and members of the opposition will be held in order to draft the postwar Constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the Committee and said that the work of the Group would be limited to — the review of the articles of the current Constitution — and warned of interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the re-election by 2020 unless his presidency ends in the past through national law and scandal, which many liberal viewers are likely hoping for.
In what would undoubtedly be the most dramatic final of a presidency ever,
At present, there is no evidence that viewers have grown weary.
Since 2014, the viewing figures at best time have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and are almost three times as high, 1.6 million, on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at best broadcast time, which is an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has peaked the cable channel listings with as many as 3.5 million viewers during big news nights.
“This is like a fire that people are drawn to, because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC’s drama “Designed Survivor” which deals with a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell is a long-standing comedian who has written \"Just the Funny Parts: And a Fear Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club.\"She has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the elections 2016.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Donald Trump.
Why?
He said, 'Because he makes me laugh', Nell tells me.
In the chaos there's an entertainment value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, Washington’s reporting can determine the future of the abortion case, Roe vs. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the well-being of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one has suddenly sat and looked for six hours on an expert panel discussing Bob Woodward's use of \"deep background sources\" to his book \"Fear\" Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of ostrich leather for $15,000 - a garment filled with hubris - as Washington Post said) and the meaning of Stormy Daniel's macabre descriptions of Donald Trumps, hm, anatomy.
I myself will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“A part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality series is that he comes with something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars” about Trump’s rotating role crew and day-to-day intrigues (mut fights with NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).

When I spoke to the TV producer Mr. Fleiss this week, there was a sun and 27 degrees outside his house in northern Kauai in Hawaii, but he sat and chewed indoors and looked at MSNBC while recording a transmission from CNN.
He couldn't stand it, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be put before the Senate Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in the wave bowl.
“I remember when we did all those crazy programs in the past and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Mr. Fleiss said to me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

Money from currents into the evenest race ever before the mid-term election
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th Congressional District receives a lot of money. Thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district, two members have now competed for the same place.
This recently redesigned suburb in Pittsburgh is represented by the democrat Conor Lamb, who got his place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb campaigns against another member, Republican Keith Rothfus. He is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned after the January Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided that the old districts were constitutionally grossly changed to the advantage of the Republicans.
The chapter of the new 17th district has caused a campaign finance struggle between the major economic sections of the major parties, Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee, (DCCC) and the National Republic Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a narrow win in a widely guarded special elections in March to Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District.
That place had been held by a republic for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts had given the Democrats a certain lead.
The United States of America considered punishing El Salvador for China support but then backed up
Diplomates noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with some resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama, until the partners threw up the Trump organisation's leadership team.
Officials of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs decided to call the heads of the U.S. missions in El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama for “news made the decision to no longer recognise Taiwan,” said the department’s spokesman Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions against El Salvador were planned, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017.
The proposed sanctions, including reduction of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American country hard with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
While the internal meetings continued, American and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
However, in mid-September high officials within the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which in practice put an end to considerations of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now speaking at the conference, which is due to take place in mid-October. It is a sign of the importance of the Presidential Administration’s view of the meeting, said the diplomats.
And the three American envoys returned silently to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson for John Bolton from the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by the three American officials, of whom two diplomats agreed to discuss the internal discussions against the promise of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and who also spoke anonymously.
Study History
The next inevitable step could be the special investigator Robert Mueller's report on Donald Trump's alleged legal abuse, for which there is now clear evidence in public records.
Mueller is also reported to direct its investigation into whether Donald Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in its attacks on the US elections.
If Congress were to change majority, Trump would be held accountable to that congregation just as he prepares to once again stand in the elections, and perhaps finally before a citizen's jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to say that Trump will inevitably fall, so neither will his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make different choices, both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how far-reaching the fight can be.
1938 German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler if only the Western countries had resisted him and stood behind the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
History revolves around such decisive events, and democracy's unswerving advance is being accelerated or slowed down.
The Americans are now facing several of these crucial events.
What should we do if Donald Trump gives Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what will happen to Mueller's investigation, fired?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that he should have proposed to secretly record the president and wondered if he would not be suitable for the office.
Rosenstein says The Times reporting is not correct.
How should we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he may attend the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that holds Donald Trump responsible?
If we fail in these trials, democracy faces a dark period.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, she sent me away to light Sabbath lights on the table decorated with the swastika.
With it as an inheritance, how could I be anything but optimistic about the future?

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is an optimist for the meeting with Rapid Wien
Rangers will receive Rapid Wien on Thursday. They know that victory against the Austrians after the impressive Spain match against Villarreal that ended unquestionably earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europe League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, until the 2-2 game against Villarreal. But he thinks that Rangers can use the result as a springboard for greater success.
It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team, says 31-year-old.
“We went into the game with the belief that we could get something, and left with a point.
Maybe we could have got it in the end, but, basically, it was probably a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half, and we came back in the second half and we were the better team.
This Thursday will be an important night in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough match. They got a good result at their last match, but if we have the audience with us, we can probably push forward and get a good result.
Last year was very tough, with everything that happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The strap is good and the guys have fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put the last season behind us and succeed -
Women sleep poorly because of fear of the pension savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear picture of how they want to be taken care of, few talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people involved in the nationwide study said that they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t step up and talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to give care if you do not talk about how you want to have it in good time.
Work with your advisor and your family and discuss where and how you want care. Your choices can have a significant impact on costs.
Take help from your financial adviser: Your counselor can also help you find a way to pay for your expenses.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance solution, a hybrid life insurance solution with cash value to cover the costs, or a self-insurance with own resources, if you can afford.
Establish legal documents: Avoid legal conflicts from the beginning.
Establish a healthcare warrant so that you can appoint a trusted person who looks over your medical care and ensures that the healthcare professional follows your wishes if you become unable to communicate.
Also consider a mandate for your finances.
You then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in place of you and make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so yourself.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who ends up in an acute medical condition and is on your way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready.
“It’s not just the economy at stake, but who are the doctors,” asked Martin.
What drugs are they?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure you have the plan ready.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia last Friday. It reports officials. The death rate is expected to rise.
The communications are out, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to obtain information from the Dongala management area, an area north of Palu near the epicenter of the earthquake. The earthquake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16 000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palau and Dongala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the main city in the province of Centrala Sulawesi, and is located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city's population was estimated to be 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami struck.
Donggala is a management area that stretches along more than 300 km off the coast of northwestern Sulawesis.
The management area, which is an administrative region under a province, had in 2017 a population estimated at 299 200 persons.
The support pillars of the province of Centrala Sulawesi's economy are fisheries and agriculture, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickelgruvdriving is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last hundred years, according to the Indonesia disaster management authority.
1938 more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Also in 1996 Western Dongala was struck by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is in the circular seismic fire, which is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A great earthquake on the west coast of Indonesian Aceh Province on northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries. 226 000 people died along the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of massive earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with the magnitude 6.8 on the Richter scale struck south of Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that struck over the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with the magnitude 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, capital city of the province of Västra Sumatra.
More than 1 100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai Islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten meters was triggered. dozens of villages were destroyed and about 300 people were killed.
2016: A shallow earthquake affected the management area of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, when people were reminded of the destruction of the mortal earthquake and the tsunami in 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok. More than 500 people died, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin’s eldest son arrested accused of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaskan governor and vice-president Sarah Palin, has been charged with abuse.
Palin, who is 29 years old and from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence, for having settled in a domestic notification of domestic violence and for having opposed the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaskan State Police.
According to the police report, he should have taken the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody of the Mat-Su County and is held against the 500-dollar bail to be paid if the suspect violates the terms of the bond, according to the KTUU TV channel.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself “guaranteed not guilty — when asked to state his position, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected of three minor crimes of Class A, which means he can get jail for up to a year and $250,000 in fines.
He has also been accused of a case of minor crimes under Class B, which is punished by one day in prison and $2 000 in fine.
It's not the first time Palin is accused of crimes.
In December 2017 he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now being handled by Alaskan Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of having committed himself to the notification of domestic violence and of the possession of weapons under the influence of that event.
His girlfriend accuses him of beating her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 after she had linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome, which comes from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia last Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity supply and communications are down, and death rates are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside the center of Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
Movies that show when it hit the loop now circulated on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors insist on rare death sentences for a suspected terrorist attack in New York City
The New York Federal Prosecutor claims the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been enforced for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a rental truck from the Home Depot building chain to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in the lower Manhattan. He reached down pedestrians and cyclists in his path by the attack, which took place in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov deliberately killed the eight victims and deliberately caused serious bodily injury, according to the declaration of intent on the death penalty lodged in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges may be a death sentence, according to the court case.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was prosecuted by a federal jury of 22 points, including eight cases of murder to support protective activities, which is often used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as the abuse and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for “wide planning and intent,” said the prosecutors, and described at the same time the way Saipov carried it out as “disgusting, cruel and inhuman —
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage and loss - it is stated in the intentional statement.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York City’s southern district has not prosecuted a death penalty in a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was enforced in a federal case in New York was 1953. The married Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced to spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were both executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who is a Uzbek citizen, showed a lack of regret during the days and months that followed the attack.
According to the police, he reported to the investigators that he was happy with what he had done.
According to the charges, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to the attack after watching IS films on his phone.
He also asked for the IS flag to be placed in his hospital room, reported the police.
He has not declared himself guilty of the 22 charges in the prosecution.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov. He stated that they are, unfortunately, disappointed on the decision of the prosecutor side.
“We believe that the decision to appeal to the death penalty rather than agree to life imprisonment without the possibility of conditional release if the defendant admits that he is guilty only extends the trauma caused by these events for all those involved,” said Patton.
Saipov's team of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to appeal to the death penalty.
Mr Tories said that NIGEL FARAGE should be given responsibility for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to \"mobilize the army of the people\" today during a protest at Tories' conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must “feel the heat” from Europeans when one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Member, Mr Bone, said at the March in Birmingham that Britain would already have left — if Nigel Farage had been the Brexit Minister.
However, the challenge faced by Theresa May in bringing the deeply divided supporters to reconciliation has been exacerbated by EU-positive tory members, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers agreement, alive under the attack by Brexitan hangers, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU itself.
Her allies have insisted that she press and try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setback, and force EU-sceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and caos,
Bone said at a mass meeting organized by the organisation Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to “spola Chequers” agreement,
He indicated that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been at the helm, we would have been out by now,” he said.
Peter Bone, representing the district of Wellingborough in Parliament, added: \"I will stand up for Brexit, but we must rewind the Chequers agreement,
He clarified his opposition to the EU and said: \"We have not fought world wars to be subjects.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.
Bone dismissed the allegations that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British would have changed and now want to stay is completely untrue”
Brexitan Hanger Andrea Jenkyns from the Tory Party was also on the march and spoke to the journalists.\"I just want to say, \"Minister of Prime Minister, listen to the people.\"
The Chequers agreement is unpopular among the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in the party and in our electoral workers who are out on the streets making sure that we are elected.
Put away the Chequers agreement and start listening
And she added a sharp message addressed to Theresa May: “Prime Ministers are allowed to keep their jobs when they keep their promises
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that politicians must “feel the heat” if they were to betray the decision taken with the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s about trust between us, that is to say the people, and the political class,” he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say to them, 'We're not gonna let you get away with it.'
In the face of the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to have our political class, which is close to betraying Brexit, to feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the army of the people in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-government and proud Britain -
At the same time, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the central city.
A group of activists waved with the text \"Tory members against Brexit\" - after the group was launched this weekend.
Labour parliamentarian Lord Adonis of the House of Lords mocked the conservatives for the security problems they encountered with a party appetizer when the conference opened.
“These are the people who say that they can have IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus the plus agreement, for unscrupulous borders and free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's just a father.
There is no good Brexit - he added.
Warren is planning a \"ordinary thinker\" to run to the Presidential office.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to make a \"ordinary thought about running for the presidential post\" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke of their future during a town hall meeting in the Western Massachusetts last Saturday.
Warren has often criticised President Donald Trump, and is now standing for re-election in November against Republican State Representative Geoff Diehl, Deputy Chairman of the Donald Trump campaign in Massachusetts 2016.
She's been the subject of speculation that she might be getting on Donald Trump by 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th city hall meeting with the voters since Donald Trump took office.
One person asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government.
A person arrested for the death of the basketball player Sims from LSU
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 for ET.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to get help identifying a man who can be seen in the pictures.
20-year-old Sims was shot to death near Southern University's campus early Friday.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head and finally died of this,” reported police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday via the 247 sports news site.
Wayde went apart to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he had been at the scene and had a weapon, and he admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any incidents and brought to the custody of the police in East Baton Rouge.
Sims was junior player, 198 cm long and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 starting last season, and averaged at 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the World Championship after team orders gave him a win over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it was clear that Mercedes' team order would play a big role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost hung out Hamilton on the drought when he defended his position during the first two yards, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the depot first and let Hamilton drive in at the back of the blade, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes went into a row later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after a little wheel-to-wheel action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free with the risk of inviting in place after a double pull to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in the rear row and lay seven at the end of the first yard on his 21st anniversary.
He then led a large part of the race and held the tires to reach a fast goal and run around the Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
Finally he arrived in the depot of the 44th shipyard but failed to speed up during the remaining eight yards when Raikkonen went up to the fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me by.
The team has done an exceptional job and received one and one two, said Hamilton.
Bad Body Language
The president, Donald Trump, mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday, for insisting that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated as Judge of the Supreme Court, is accused of sexual abuse.
The president, who spoke at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly address the testimony of Ford before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were “Elkah, nasty and lying”
“The only thing that could happen and the nice thing that happened in the last days of the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry, mean, nasty and lying,” he said.
\"You see press releases and leaks and they say, 'No, I haven't.
I haven't done that.'
Do you remember?
Did you leak, Diane Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked it.'
Wait a minute.
No, we haven't leaked anything, he added, and imitated the senator.
The letter containing details of Ford's charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have come from her office.
“I haven’t covered Ford’s accusations, I haven’t leaked her story,” said Feinstein to the Committee, according to The Hill.
She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential as she wanted.
But her dementia does not seem to have fit the president, who during Saturday night’s meeting commented on it like this: “I’ll tell you one thing. That was really bad body language.
She may not have, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
The President continues to support the candidate to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual crimes by three women, and he indicated that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
They are determined to take power back with all the necessary means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to gain power and control,\" said the president according to the digital Mediaite news site.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two targets for Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars served the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Belfast Giants received an early two-goal lead through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie signed off for the home team before Dwyer restored Belfast Giant's leadership.
Francois Bouchard announced for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season of Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind and beat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting for the season of the two teams, and the Belfast Giants had won the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 p.m. on assistance from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave assistance when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the intense first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquartt delivered to Cownie who announced at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Belfast Giants was in the lead at the first break when he scored his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again set a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, and he secured the winnings with his team's fifth midway through the end period.
Belfast Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home against Milton Keynes at their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died because hundreds of people on a plane could escape earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is now hailed as a hero after he died when he saw to it that a plane with hundreds of people on board could lift safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a large earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy aftershock continues to torment the area and many are trapped in the storm of the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly floating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed behind to make sure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could lift safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was going to fall apart.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian TV channel ABC News.
“We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We are overwhelmed to hear this — he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the death rate can rise to over a thousand people. The disaster relief authority says that there is limited access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The death rate is believed to continue to increase because there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been able to reach,” said Sutpo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the authority.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are flying in aid and supplies.
The 35 - year - old mother Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance comes with dead bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere,
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will meet there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.
The President of Indonesia Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready - according to CNN.
Indonesia was affected earlier this year by earthquakes on Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing after an aircraft crashed in a lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific Ocean, now states that a man is missing. Previously it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated from the sinking planet and were in safety.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said that it worked with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to questions about the details of the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed in the water as it tried to land at the airport in the Chuuk Islands.
Officials stated on Friday that seven persons had been taken to hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and what the event process looked like.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane slipped past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew in very low.
“It’s extremely good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to wade through mid-deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking planet.
He said that the cabin crew panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who worked in the vicinity to develop a shipyard also helped in rescue work by using an inflatable boat to drive people ashore before the plane sank in the deep water of 30 meters.
Data from Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analysts draw up a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded on Saturday's plaguing in the second trial against a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used cell phone lists to design the 29-year-old addressed Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber's movements on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received locational information from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicts his previous claims, reported the news newspaper The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber’s cell phone during the time he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he was \"lying, because my truck was in Nashville\"
Another contradiction was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis for some time after Chambers' death deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He evicted her from his life,” said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop-trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol thinks that hip-hop has come far away from its origins in political messages and to attack social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hiphop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently received a boost in Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
A black one again?!
New York’s baby girl matches a couple due to resignation after a “racist” text message
A child's girl in New York matches a couple of discriminatory dismissals after she got a wrong text message from her mother, complaining that she was a black one again.
The couple deny that they would be racists and compare the atmosphere with \"extortion.\"
Two-child mom Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed fear when she realized that the new nanny Giselle Maurice was black when she came to her first working day 2016.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote a text message to his husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman-illa was a modist and fired Maurice, claiming that their former child girl, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that instead she expected a Filipino woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and sent home in a taxi.
Now she sues the couple to receive compensation for the dismissal. She asks compensation in the range of 350 dollars per day for the job she was originally hired to do, which would be for six months and where she would live with the couple. However, she had no contract.
I want to show them that you don't do that - she said to the New York Post on Friday. -I know that's discrimination.
The couple dissuade the charges that they would be racists and say that the only thing that was to end Giselle Maurice's employment was that they were worried that they would not be able to trust her when they had offended her.
My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We’re not racists,” said Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
“But would you entrust your children to someone whom you had been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously.
Plasco compared the atmosphere with \"expression\" and said his wife was going to give birth two months later and was in a very difficult situation.
You're supposed to walk on a person like that?
It's not very nice of you to do - allow the investment banker Plasco.
The legal process is still ongoing, but public opinion has quickly condemned the social media couple and criticises them for their behaviour and reasoning.
The Paddington publishers didn't think the readers could relate to a speaking bear, revealing a new letter.
Paddington author Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter as follows: “It is difficult to imagine what it was like for a person who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny, considering what we now know about Paddington's great success.
She told me that her father, who had worked as a cameraman at the BBC before he was inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the first edition was \"bitter sweet\" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important member of our family” and added that her father was proud in silence of his final success.
“He was quite silent, and not a boastful person,” she said.
“But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds in something. You get proud of the child even if it isn’t you who made it.
I think he saw Paddington's successes that way.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he would always give Paddington credit for himself --
My daughter was going to die, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that you didn't expect her to make it, said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad saying that she would die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, \"I love you so much, Tashi, my darling.
I'll be right with you.
I'm coming to you.
The drugs that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly ebbed out and left her body.
She had died just before and now everything was extinguished.
I just got to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I could not laugh or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to pull myself together.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the difficult trial she went through.
She said no one knew.
I bent my head down, and the tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt an overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Merging women set up postcards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that you can call for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and took his life when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel as bad as I do every day,” she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, and she tells me that her son was a promising chef who had an infectious smile.
Everyone knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smile lit the room.
But he stopped working before he died, because he was “in a very dark place”
Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his sibling when he had killed himself in 2014.
Sharon Davis says: “I constantly worry about consequences...
Sharon Davis created the cards to let people know there are people you can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still, talk about it.
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost his partner since 15 years, Mark, some time after his mother's death.
“He hadn’t said he felt depressed or depressed or anything,” she says.
\"Some days before Christmas, we noticed that he behaved differently.
On Christmas Day, he was at the bottom, and when the kids opened their Christmas presents, he didn't have eye contact with them or anything.
She says his death was a very hard blow for them, but they have to get through it.
It'll tear us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI initiates investigation
“I thought that if we could achieve something similar to what he asked for - an investigation that is limited in time and scope - we could perhaps get a little consensus,” said Jeff Flake on Saturday. He added that he feared that the committee would split up because of deeply rooted party disagreements.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their resistance depends entirely on the time.
The mid-term elections will take place in just five weeks, on 6 November. If the Republicans make a bad choice, which is expected, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called Senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was personally secretary to George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and confirm his choice in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors under Kim
The number of North Koreans jumping off to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's Ministry of Reunion, says that 1 127 people jumped off last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park says that harder border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher charges for human smugglers are important reasons.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korea’s defectors are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30 000 North Koreans should have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fly through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China sees the dropouts as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often send them back with violence.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is still technically at war with each other, has improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries of Pyongyang met for talks focusing on the determined negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work to free the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US sanctions of the lack of success since then.
“Without confidence in the United States there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we certainly cannot disarm ourselves unilaterally first,” Ri said at a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says that he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader of the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh-hysterically - and said that he was temperately unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi’s comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had behaved like that, she would be called ‘hysteric’,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the charges of having sacrificed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and from time to time he screamed almost, and the voice held up when he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee, and said that the accusations against him were a “scotch and coordinated character murder — organized by liberals who were angry about Hillary Clinton losing the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she felt that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because it showed that he was partial to the disadvantage of the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way in which he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to put Kavanaugh before national law if he was elected, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I can say this — if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he’s at now,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeal of Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that she as a democrat was concerned about what decisions Kavanaugh might make against the Health Insurance Act The Affable Care Act or the abortion case Roe vs. Wade, because he is considered to be a conservative judge.
In his confirmatory inquiries Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not the time for a hysterical and partial person to sit down in court and expect us all to applaud, said Pelosi.
Women have to stand up.
It is a righteous criticism, months and years of anger that boils over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” said Ms. Steinem to me 45 years later.
I don't think it's unusual.
And she continued: “I got good help from a woman who was CEO somewhere. She said that she also cried when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started to cry she said to the person she spoke to: ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.
And then she went on.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are allowed to vent anger in part because they are often misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in a man-dominated office, where I once wept with indescribable anger, was that I was taken by an older woman. It was a chilly boss that I had always been a little afraid of, and she pulled me into a stairwell.
“Never let them see that you’re crying — she said to me.
They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and they're glad they managed to push you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught up with an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason not to investigate the idea of himself being in the presidential election.
“It wasn’t a well thought out decision,” she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates already, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\"
Since she was late, she was behind with the fundraiser, and she promised not to go in as a candidate unless she got 2 million dollars together.
It was a project doomed to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave her $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
They think I'm getting a discount, she wondered.
When she announced in a speech that she would not launch a formal presidential campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect money and target herself against voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism, that the voice held on.
“You could have thought that I had had a nervous breakdown — remember Schröder apronning the press’s reactions.
You could have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, \"What are they gonna write on my tombstone?\"
'She cried?'
Why the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The opening star of the US-China trade war was deafening. The war is far from over, but the crack between the countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by treating important Chinese exports like solar panels, steel and aluminum with customs.
The most important escalation came this week, with new customs duties on goods for $200 billion, which means that in practice half of all goods coming into the United States from China are subject to customs duties.
Every time, it was the same coin, and recently, it was paid between five and ten per cent of American goods for 60 billion dollars.
China has promised to match US action. The world's second largest economy is probably not going to step down within the foreseeable time.
Getting Washington to back up means bending to demands, but publicly crawling for the United States would be far too embarrassing for China's President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the U.S. Trade War press can give a positive support to China in the long term, by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
“A rapid political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic panic in either country, and it is actually far more dangerous than the viewers have previously wanted to acknowledge,” said Abigail Grace, research assistant with a focus on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria-redo - for returning refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that it is ready to accept voluntary return refugees and appeal for help to build the country, which is in ruins after the war of more than seven years.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said that the conditions in the country are now improving.
“The situation in place today is more stable and secure, thanks to our success in combating terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to build up the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and living.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian aid.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that it did not accept conditional support or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe agreed to win Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with the final position 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in line on European soil and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard during most of the tournament, ended up in the water at the sound of the 16th hole par 3 course, and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever done 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth fought 5 & 4 of the European team's lowest rated players, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest rated player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have made his last Ryder Cup.
Spanjor Sergio Garcia, who is a veteran with eight Ryder Cup behind him, became the most successful europe ever with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win back the victory.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help, said a moved Garcia after the victory of the European team.
He handed over the stick to his countryman John Ram who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in single on Sunday.
“What incredible pride, beating Tiger Woods. I am raised to look at him,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four games in France, and now has the 13-21-3 result for his career in Ryder cup.
A strange statistic for one of the world's best players ever, who has won 14 major titles, which has only been surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA fought all weekend to find fairway, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf during the entire tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the team’s discouraging achievement: “I’m proud of these guys, they’ve been fighting.
It was time this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the fight.
The hat for Thomas.
He's an amazing captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna work with the U.S. PGA tour and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
You get to bow and bow.
They played better than us.
Algal flowering: The tails decline in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in algal flowering concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Commission, unevener flowering is reported in the areas around the large municipalities Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which may indicate reduced levels.
Alg flowering stretches along just over 20 miles of the coast, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee.
Stains can be seen about a mile out into the sea outside the large municipality of Hillsborough, but in fewer places compared to last week.
Alg flowering has also been observed in the large municipality of Pasco.
Medium concentrations in or off the coast of Pinellas have been reported in the past week. Outside the coast of Hillsborough low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations in or off the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations to medium concentrations in or off the coast of Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue to come from large municipalities Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwestern Florida that week.
