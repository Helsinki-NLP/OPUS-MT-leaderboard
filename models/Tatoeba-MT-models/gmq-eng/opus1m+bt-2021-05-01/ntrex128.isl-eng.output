Well - meaning counselors worry about “looking like fools ”
Some members of the council suggest that their title be changed to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Council).
The concern has arisen because of a plan to change the Council’s name to the well-being of the council.
The stewards of all classes are concerned that this might make them ridicule.
One union member said that his team was worried that “it fights with Twp and Pwp —
For readers living outside Wales: in veld means twp stupid and pwp means faeces.
A member of the Group of Plaid Cymru said that the whole class is “dissatisfied — and has made other suggestions.
A prominent member of the team said that his class had “an open mind — about the change in names, but pointed out that there was no big difference between the word MWP and Muppet (floon).
In this context it can be said that the veld w is carried in a similar way to u in Icelandic.
The counsel, now acting on a legal basis to make the name changes, said: “The decision on all the names of the members of the council will, of course, lie with the members themselves —
The government of Wales (The Government of Wales Act 2017) empowered the Council to change its name.
In June, the Council published a public opinion poll showing strong support for calling the Council a Well - to - Do Council.
With regard to the title of the council, the WMP (Welsh Parliament members, elected congressmen) elected, but MWP received the most support from the public in the polls.
According to one report, stewards now make other suggestions, but it may be difficult to reach an agreement for the chairman of the council, Elin Jones, who is to present a bill for the changes within a few weeks.
The reform paper will also include other changes in the way the Council works, including rules on the exclusion of council members and the organisation of the committee system.
When discussion of the bill begins, stewards will be able to make final decisions about their title.
The Macedonians vote in elections for a change in the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country’s name in the “Nordic Macedonia”
This matter was put to the vote in an attempt to resolve decades of conflict with neighboring Greece, which has its own province by the name Macedonia.
Athens has for a long time claimed that their northern neighbors’ names are equivalent to those of its territory and have repeatedly protested against their applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the change in his name, has said that he will not consider the election as valid.
However, supporters of the voting payments, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have said that the name change is simply a price that needs to be paid for membership of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's church bells are silenced by the churches in Harlem in trouble
“ Older people I have spoken to said that a bar and a church were once found on every corner of the street, ” said Mr. Adams.
“ Today, neither one can be found there —
He said that it would be understandable for a stretcher to go down.
“ People have other ways of meeting — these days, he said.
“Bars are no longer the hubs of the neighborhood where people gather regularly —
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money that proceeds from the sale of property will not last as long as leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will be returned to the birthright”
He added that possible churches would be replaced by residential homes full of people who would not help to save their neighborhood’s remaining refuges.
“The largest majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings become white, ” he said, “and will therefore hurry for the complete closure of these churches, since it is unlikely that most of the people who move to these apartments will be members of these churches —
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the centre of the Black Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and the St. Martin’s Church decades later.
In the 1930 ’ s, the original white Methodist congregation moved away.
A congregation of local blacks took over the building.
The church of black people took over St. Martin’s church under the direction of Father John Howard Johnson, who took the initiative to repudiate merchants on 125th Street, the main shopping street of Harlem, who wanted to recruit black workers or give them increases in position.
The building was seriously damaged by fire in 1939, but members of Father Johnson’s congregation planned to rebuild it and also had it built.
Father David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson, called the bells proud “the clocks of the poor people...
In July, the expert who played the game of the clock called it a different name: “Menture treasure — and “a unique historical instrument —
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also claimed that this was the first game in the world that a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, played, but he moved over to a larger game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had not got anyone else in his place.
Over the past few months, many architects and contractors have made their way to St. Martin, some of the church leaders and others of the Episcopal District.
In July, the Council of Churches, which supervises the parish and is appointed church leaders, wrote the Episcopal District and expressed its concern that the Episcopal District “would seek to get the cost over — the Council of Churches, even if it had not been involved in the recruitment of the architects and contractors sent by the Episcopal District.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the Episcopal District.
Sharks hurt a 13-year-old boy who dived after a lobster in California
According to the government, a shark attacked a 13 - year - old boy and hurt him on Saturday when the boy was diving for a lobster in California on the first day of the lobster fishing season.
The attack was just before seven o’clock in the morning near the Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help and then riding over with a group of others to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought that it was only a thrill to have hoarse, but then “he realized that the boy cried out,“ I was bit!
I was bitten--
“ Hammel said of what he saw when he came to the boy.
“ I cried out to everyone to get out of the water, saying: “There is a shark in the water — Hammel added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady children's hospital in San Diego, where he is seriously wounded.
It is not known what kind of shark the boy is attacked.
The Coast Guard officer, Larry Giles, said at the media conference that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but he was not of a dangerous type of sharks.
Giles added that the victim suffered a serious injury to the upper body.
The authorities closed the coast from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami’s coast in Encinitas for 48 hours, in an experimental and safety direction.
Giles said that over 135 different species of sharks are in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plan to make a mistake in Britain’s cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s is going to have a race with Boots, SuperDrug, and Debenham with their beauty shelves in a shopping center style and with specialized assistants.
This is part of a plan to enter Britain’s cosmetics market, which is worth £2.8 billion and is increasing as fashion and household products sales decline. The larger cosmetic shelves will be tested in 11 stores all over the country and will be set up in more stores next year if possible.
Investing in cosmetic products is part of a supermarket to use a shelf box that was previously new to TVs, microwaves, and household products.
Sainsbury’s claims to double her choice of cosmetic products for up to 3,000 product types, including brand names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get increased space with marked areas similar to those found in the stores such as Boots.
The stores are also going to re-start their sales on their Boutique brandy so that the majority of the goods are vegan-friendly, but younger consumers demand it to an ever greater extent.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will test the product spirit in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opened at Croydon, South London, last week, and the next will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
In order to buy a small amount of food every day in neighborhood stores, the Internet store and the increased trend in consumption mean that more effort is needed to get people to come to it.
Mike Coupe, manager of Sainsbury, said that the stores would be more and more like malls as the chain of commerce tries to fight the low - commodity stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and products than food.
Sainsbury’s has put Argos camp in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat camps since the two chains were bought two years ago, according to which it has increased sales and made purchases more profitable.
The first attempt by the store to revitalize its cosmetics and cosmetics department was not successful.
Sainsbury’s test of cooperation with Boots around 2000 ended because of a dispute over how to share the drug sales in the supermarket.
The new policy follows Sainsbury’s sale of 281 pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, Lloyd’s owner, of 125 million pounds three years ago.
According to the policy, Lloyds will have a role in these plans by adding a wide range of luxury skin marks, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of the market Sainsbury, said: “We have completely changed the appearance of our cosmetics to improve the environment for customers.
We also have investments in special training for personnel who will be on the inside for advice.
Our choice of products is designed to meet all needs; a healthy environment and a comfortable location make us an exciting beauty store that transforms old business habits.
Peter Jones of the year after Holly Willoughby broke up with a £11 million deal.
Peter Jones, the star of the Dragon Den program, became “evermore — after the TV screen Holly Willoughby gave up an 11 million-pound contract with his company to focus on new deals with Mark and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their domestic product and accessory brand, Truly.
The company had been compared to Goop, the trademark of Gwyneth Paltrow.
Willoughby, 37 years of age, introduced the parts This Morning, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has understood Peter Jones, the star of Dragons’ Den, with a painful end to his participation in a popular life - style company in the late days to focus on new and profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources tell Jones has been “the last time — at a difficult meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his commercial power station in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, when the popular television woman admitted she did not have enough time for the household goods and accessories brand Truly because of the new contracts worth up to £1.5 million.
The company has been compared to Goop, the trademark of Gwyneth Paltrow, and was designed to double Willoughby’s property, which is an estimated 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby was 37 years old, Instagram announced that she was going to withdraw from Truly, Jones of Britain flew to stay in one of her many summer homes.
One source reported: “Truly was the one who was the one who longed for Holly’s priority.
This was to be her future project, which would make her succeed for the next two decades.
Her decision to stop was totally open.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so short for the line to go on the market.
There's a lot of product in Marlow's headquarters that's ready to go to the sale.
Experts believe that the elimination of This Morning, which is among the most popular of Britain’s stars, can cost the company millions because of large warehouses, ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household wares, and possibly lead to further delays in the sale of the product line.
This could also mean the end of long friendships.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends of Jones and his wife, Taru Capp, for a decade.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined them as chairman of the government in March.
Parin spends his summer vacations together, and Jones shares 40 percent of his share in Baldwin, a company that produces television.
Willoughby will be the official representative of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as the ITV component I'm a Celebrity.
A source from a close man named Jones said last night: “We don’t want to say anything about his business affairs —
Hard discussions “and then we fell in love...
He grumbled with the criticism he received from the media, for saying something that many would consider inappropriate for the president, and for being so positive towards the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Said Trump and copied the newsman's voice.
\"I haven't given anything after...
He pointed out that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards nuclear disarmament North Korea.
However, discussions about nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the leading ambassador of North Korea, told an international leader of the United States General Assembly on Saturday that the north had not received an appropriate answer — from the United States at the first steps in North Korea toward nuclear disarmament.
Instead, he said that the United States continued to maintain a business model in order to maintain pressure.
Trump was more positive in his talk.
He said, \"We're very close to North Korea.\"
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions would have lost their lives.
Now our relationship is great.
He said his attempts to improve Kim’s relationship have returned positive results — rocket tests had stopped, hostages had been released, and the earthly remains of American soldiers were returned.
He also warned his unusual approach to discussing his relationship with Kim.
“ It’s so easy to act like President, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into a crowded stadium, there were only 200 people standing there, ” said Trump, pointing at the crowd ahead.
Floods and earthquakes in Indonesia are causing great damage to the island, hundreds have died
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, international relief organizations were told that they were not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lombok’s inhabitants had to flee their homes, an emergency situation was not declared, but it is the reason why an international organization can start relief operations there.
“ Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it clear that they are not going to ask for help from international organizations, so this is difficult, ” said Ms. Sumbung.
Although the Save the Children organization is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not certain when foreign relief workers can start working in the area.
Mr. Sutpo, the national disaster agency official, said that Indonesian officials were considering the situation in Pala to see if international organisations should be allowed to assist in relief work.
Based on the prevalence of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is tragically ill prepared to protect itself from natural forces.
The flood waves have been built in Aceh, which are rare sights at other shorelines.
It seems that the lack of a tidal - sounding missile in Pala has added to the loss of life, even if a warning has been issued.
Even in the best of circumstances, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia can be a challenge.
Natural disasters make planning even more complex.
A medical ship who has been at Lombok’s port to care for the victims of the earthquake is now on its way to Pala, but it will take at least three days to get to the new accident site.
President Joko Widododo made it the main point of his campaign to improve the downturned transportation of Indonesia, and he has put a lot of money in the roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has plagued the administration of Mr. Joko, but elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also needs to deal with persistent tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted more conservative religion.
More than a thousand died, and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with fields, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.

Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing against Chelsea in the selection department by challenging 89 minutes of Saturday’s play at the Stamford Bridge stadium in London.
Sturridge received a shipment from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's team's goal under 1-0.
He rolled the ball to the left and then tried a target toward the far end.
The ball flew high above the target and towards its right corner.
The ball eventually crossed the Kepa Arrizabalag, which jumped up, and into the net.
“I just wanted to try to get into this position, to catch the ball, and players like Shaq always play it as long as possible so I tried to create as much time as I could,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
\"I saw Kante come and touched once and didn't think so much into it, but just took the shot --
Chelsea was over 1-0 in half after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in 25 minutes.
In the campaign, Chelsea, who gave the ball a lift to Mateo Kovacic, then spread from the centre to the middle of the playroom Liverpool.
Kovacic made the ball go fast between the center.
Then he sent the ball forward in a magnificent way, and sent Hazard into front of the Witnesses.
Hazard ran off and scored the corner with a left footshot at Alisson Becker, the target of Liverpool.
Liverpool attends Naples in the final selection section at 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.

The short British Congress of Cromwell is the latest monument that is accused of “rewriting the story”
The ban would be poetic justice for the Taliban destruction of his fanatical Puritan followers on so many cultural and religious jewels in England.
However, the Cromwell Society said that Mr. Crick's proposal was \"stupid\" and \"trys to re-use the story.\"
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the discussion about removing a statue, it was inevitable that the short cut of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be before the beating.
The anti - English Civil War against culture signs were neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestors Thomas in the first century C.E.
The glorious map of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, marks the 19th - century spirit of the season and is part of a man’s history that many people believe is unreserved.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps rather late in the 19th century than today, to have been the guardian of the Congress against foreign pressure, in his case the kingdom.
There is still a major historical difference as to whether this description is entirely correct.
However, in the mid - 17th century, it is certain that the conflicts have shaped the development of our people and that Cromwell is a known individual representing one side of their conflict.
It is worth celebrating and remembering his accomplishments as the Protector of the Kingdom —
Pigs attack a Chinese farmer and kill him
Pigs attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him on the market in the southwest of China, according to local news.
The man named only by his last name “Yuan” was found dead with a broken artery and covered with blood near a stable on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou region, according to South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, Xining, Qinghai Province, China, a pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine into a pig plant.
According to his uncle, he had traveled from neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the uncle found him dead and saw that a door in a nearby pig’s house was open.
He said that inside the pavement there had been a big nag with a bloody mouth.
According to the report, the trial confirmed that 250 kg of the nag had killed the farmer.
“My cousin’s feet were bloody and wounded, ” said the uncle, with the last name “Wu — to Guiyang Evening News.
A video camera tape showed Yuan coming to the market at 4:40 in the morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his uncle.
The owner of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that no one else was attacked while the police collected evidence in the field.
According to news, the Yuan family and the owner of the market are entitled to compensation for his death.
There are listed cases where pigs have attacked people, although rare.
In 2016, pigs attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and seriously injured the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - pound [300 kg] pig hugged a farmer with a tractor until his wife threw the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba to the CBC News said that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that they may have a blood taste that can provoke aggressiveness.
They're just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt anybody.
You just have to show them respect, he said.
The remnant of Hurricane Rose carries a great rainfall over the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosha’s strength is decreasing as he passes over a cooler sea by the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry a great waste, which could cause floods in northern Mexico and southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa became a hurricane in category 1, with a wind level of 136 km per hour, at 5 a.m. to the eastern hour on Sunday, and it was located over 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is scheduled to go north on Sunday.
At the same time, it is formed across the Pacific Ocean and will go east towards the United States’ west coast, so when Rosa arrives at the Baja California Coast on Monday as a tropical storm, a great tropical storm will follow northward into the southwest of the United States.
Rosu will be accompanied by up to 25 cm of waste in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical race will be mixed with the low that approaches and forms large and rural wastes across the southwest in the next days.
Local wastes between 2.5 and 10 cm and can cause dangerous shocks, soil movement, and possible forms in the desert.
A massive tropical crisis will cause up to 5 to 10 cm of waste per hour in some places, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm of waste is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in the vast Arizona region.
As a result of the spread of tropical rains, there is a potential for rapid-efficiencies in rapidly worsening conditions.
People are strongly advised not to travel to the desert on foot when there is a risk of tropical rain.
A great rain can turn gulls into a roaring river, and thunderstorms produce windstorms and duststorms.
The nearby lay will carry local deposits in certain areas at the southern California coast line.
There is a potential of more than 1 cm of waste that could cause a slight movement on the soil and on the roads.
This is the first source of the region during the rainy season.
A few scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before the yield spread over larger areas late on Monday and Tuesday.
A high level of yield spreads across the four states on Tuesday and ends on Wednesday.
Large changes in temperature can be expected in October throughout the United States as the North Atlantic region cools down, but the tropical region continues to be quite warm.
At times, this may result in extreme fluctuations in temperature over short distances.
Consider a very good example of a great difference in temperature in the United States on Sunday.
There's almost a 7 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
For the next few days, persistent summer food will try to build up and distribute again.
A large part of the United States of America is expected to get warm early October with temperatures of about 25 degrees or more from the southern plains to the north-east.
Fever could rise to 25 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees higher than the average.
Our long - term weather forecast indicates that there is a high risk of temperature above the average for the East in the early part of October.
Over 20 million people watched over Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million people were watching the exciting testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court judge, on Tuesday and the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual abuse that was supposed to have occurred in the 1980 ’ s.
At the same time, the political patrolling continued, and TV stations interrupted a regular program to publish the latest news on Friday: the Jeff Flake, an elder from Arizona, submitted a bill to enable the FBI to investigate the charges for one week.
Ford told the elders ’ judicial committee that she was confident that Kavanaugh had been drinking and trying to undress her at a school party.
Kavanaugh, in emotional witnessing, said that he was confident that this did not happen.
Likely, more people watched the trial than the 20,4 million that Nielsen reported watching on Friday.
The company measured the average views of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The figures were not available immediately for other television channels that showed the interrogations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen, too, usually faces problems in measuring audiences in offices.
To put this into context, this audience is similar in size to the finals of football or the Oscar Prize.
According to Nielsen, most people watched the hearings that took place all day at Fox News Channel or 5.69 million.
ABC was second with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.44 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the trial, interest remained high.
Flake was the center of the game on Friday.
After the editor of this Republic party’s office announced that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, the Commissioner CNN and CBS reached pictures of when the Protestants called him on Friday morning when he tried to enter an elevator to attend a meeting of the Court Committee.
He stood down for a few minutes while soon raining on him in a live broadcast at CNN.
One woman said, \"I'm standing right here in front of you--
\"Do you think he's telling the countrymen the truth?
People told him: “You have power while so many women stand powerless —
Flake told his office that he had made a statement, and before closing the elevator door, he said that he would express himself rather at the committee meeting.
The cable and television stations were all live later when the Justice Committee asked whether Kavanaugh’s appointment should continue to be elected by the Senate.
Flake said that he would only do so if the FBI examined the charges against the other nominees next week, but the majority of the Democratics have encouraged this.
In part, Flake was convinced of his friend Chris Coons, a Democratic senator.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several other senators thereafter.
Flake’s votes changed greatly because it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without the study.
President Trump has authorized an investigation by the FBI on the charges against Kavanaugh.
May, Britain’s prime minister, accuses critics of “being in a political game ” because of Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Theresa May, Prime Minister, the critics of her plan to step out of the European Union to “be in a political game — about the future of Britain and undermine the country’s interests.

In another interview, which was published next to her interview on the cover page, Boris Johnson, her former Foreign Secretary, said that the so-called Chequers programme on Brexit and said that the UK and the European Union should pass to each other would be “absolutely disquieting”
Wayde Sims shooting, the police arrest Dyteon Simpsons in connection with the death of the LSU player.
The police have arrested one suspect because of the death of Wayde Sims in a fatal shooting, and he was a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
20 - year - old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for a second - grade murder charge, according to Baton Rouge Police.
The authorities published a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson and said that Sims lost her glasses in the clashes.
Police found the glasses on the scene, and they said that they were found genetics from Simpson, according to the WAFB, CBS’ sister partner.
The police say Simpson confessed to interrogations that he shot Wayde and killed him.
According to his lawyer, the amount of $350,000 was guaranteed.
The East Baton Rouge Bureau published a preliminary report on Friday saying that the cause of death is a bullet in the head and down the throat.
The authorities wanted to thank Special Forces in Louisiana, police crime lab, Southern University Police and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, head of LSU’s sports, thanked law enforcement officers for “their generosity and their search for justice...
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall, two - foot - ahead man grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He scored 5.6 points on average and took 2.6 out of turn for each game in the last season.
Will Wade, LSU’s basketball coach, said on Friday morning that the team was “shammed — and“ in shock — because of the death of Wayde.
“ This is something you worry about all the time, ” said Wade.
Mountains spew ashes over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern capital of Mexico.
The U.S. National Center for Disease Prevention advised Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after an increase in activity and 183 cases of gas and ash were reported for 24 hours.
The center watched the vibrations and tremors from the volcano.
In Mexico, as in Xochimilco, pictures on social media showed a thin layer of ashes on the streets.
Since the earthquake of 7.1, Richter, over the middle of Mexico in September 2017, has noticed increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometers southeast of the capital city.
The volcano, known as “Don Goyo — has been active since 1994.
Police in the Fight against Catalan Separation Just Before the Birthday of the State of Independence
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent Protestants attacked riot police, and thousands participated in protests on the occasion of the first anniversary of the controversial elections in Catalonia to declare independence.
A group of masked separationists stoned egg - based riot police and threw away a powder paint that formed a dark cloud of dust on the streets, usually filled with tourists.
A conflict also broke out later that day, and police forces used bats to control the fights.
“ We do not forget, and we do not forgive — for a few hours while their opponents cried out in opposition: “No longer live Spain, ” cried the adversities.
Fourteen, according to local media, needed attention because of a minor injury suffered by them in protests.
Great tensions continue in the autonomous area one year after the October 1 Order was imposed on the authorities of Madrid, which was welcomed by the Catalan divisives.
The majority of the elected elections were independent, but participation was poor, since most who opposed ignored the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people last year were injured when police tried to stop the elections in elections across the region, a region with conflicts.
A group of independents had stayed overnight on Friday to prevent protests in support of the country’s police.
The protest procedure took place but was forced to go another way.
The 68 - year - old Narcis Termes joined in the protests of separationists with his wife and said that he was no longer hopeful that Catalonia would gain independence.
“ In the first place, we experienced some of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy in being able to vote, but now we are stuck, ” he said.
Despite having achieved the necessary but little victory in the district discussions last December, the independent classes of Catalonia have had difficulty maintaining steam this year, since many of the most well-known leaders are either voluntarily exiled or in custody waiting for justice because of their role in the organisation of the vote and the independent resolution.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who protested in support of the police on his phone, said that the politicians of both states had encouraged the conflict.
\"The tension keeps rising,\" he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been imprisoned and asked to trial since late last year, announced that he would volunteer for the European Parliament next year.
“The best way to condemn the backdrop to democratic values and the oppression we have seen in the Spanish Government, ” he said.

Menga score to 1-0 win Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga’s first goal guaranteed the victory of Livingston
The Livingston team, who came from the lower department, turned Rangers into an open shield, and Steven Gerrard had to endure his second loss in 18 games as director of the Ibrox team.
Mark Dolly Menga made the difference and Gary Holt's team is now in second place with Hibernian.
The Gerrard team has not yet worked in the selection section of this season and is playing at Hearts, which is eight points ahead of the top seat, the next Sunday.
For this game, the Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna in the European Department on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is still undefeated in the league with six wins, and Holt main coach has not yet had to experience loss since he replaced Kenny Miller in the last month.
Livington Losses Opportunity for Unbiased Visitors
Holts was supposed to have been over a long time before it scored, but their directness caused Rangers great trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then shot by after running his way through the defense to receive a balding broadcast from Graig Halkett across the goal.
The guests allowed Rangers to play in front of them calmly, knowing that they could cause the guests trouble in the right places.
And that is how the goal was challenged.
Rangers got a second hand and Livingston worked on creating target opportunities. Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga together, who received a shipment and scored from the centre of the vision.
At that point, the Rangers ruled the ball, but the defense of the locals was unbreakable, and Liam Kelly, a goalkeeper, did not have to work hard.
Thus it continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos had managed to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by the feet of Allan McGregor, Ranger's target, and Lithgow shot from the goal of a seek from Livingston.
Askers were constantly hit by the Vititeig Livingston but were kicked off, and two demands for a fanship - after the defense of Halketts against the deputy Glenn Middleton, and one by hand - were dismissed.
“Glorious” - by Livingston Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, journalist BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Stadium
It's a great performance and a great outcome for Livingston.
For a normal man, they stood great and continued to exceed all expectations of their conduct.
Their style of play and their team have hardly changed anything since they got back into the top league, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for having run the team together since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, the commanding officer was extremely good and led a fully organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell on his toes all the time.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they have been under Gerrard’s rule, they played far ahead.
They failed to complete their visits and only once managed to open up the home half, so this should be a awakening for Rangers who are now in the middle of the department.
Erdogan gets blinded receptions in Cologne
It was a smiled and bright sky on Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met over breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the two NATO countries.
There have been differences between them on issues such as human rights, freedom of the media and the accession of Turkey to the European Union.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to open up a huge new mosque.
The city is the home of most Turkish people outside Turkey itself.
The police used security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosquito, but many supporters were able to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — many of them Kurds — also heard and condemned both Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
The two protesters reflect how controversial this guest is, but he is hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and hated as a dictator by others.

Six jailers were injured when riots broke into a male security prison, as reported by the prison agency.
There were riots in Long Lartin, Worcestershire, about 9:30 p.m., to British local time on Sunday and still drift.
“Tordo — Special Forces have been called to the area to try to control the riots of eight prisoners and are confined to one of the prisons.
The guards received attention because of minor damage to the face at the scene.
A prison official said: “In the Long Lartin prison, trained jailers have been called out to deal with cases that are going on in the Long Lartin prison.
Six employees have received attention as a result of injury.
No violence has taken place in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could expect to spend even more time behind locks and bars —
Over 500 prisoners are in the Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the director of the prison was announced to have had to go to the hospital after a prisoner attacked him.
And in October of last year, riot police were called on to deal with a serious peace disorder, where billiards were attacked.
The Hurricane Rose threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with emergency trails (dry areas could benefit from)
It is rare to cross Arizona, but it is likely that it will be early next week when the remains of the Hurricane Rosa pass over the southwest, with the risk of sudden floods.
National weather facilities have already issued emergency warnings for Monday and Tuesday in the west of Arizona and south and west Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to cross Phoenix straight on Tuesday and arrive late Monday with a waste.
The local weather agency in Phoenix said on Twitter that only “ten collapses have been able to maintain the strength to be classified as tropical storms or lows less than 320 km away from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 64 km away from Arizona border
The final predictions from the hurricane center predict 5-10 cm of waste, with a single discharge of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
It is likely that the yield will be between 2.5 and 5 cm in other parts of the southwest, including the centre of the Mountains and the Great Land (The Great Basin), with the possibility of a single yield of up to 10 cm.
For those who are not in danger of being caught in a hurry, Rosa’s offspring may be blessed because there is a great drought in the area.
Although the flood can cause great damage, some of this waste will have a positive effect, since drought is now in the southwest.
According to U.S. drought control, at least 40 percent of Arizona is drought — according to news from weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will land on the Baja California scandal in Mexico.
Rosa was still classified as a hurricane on Sunday morning with maximum wind power up to 136 km per hour and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico traveling north at 19 km per hour.
The storm passes over a cooler sea in the Pacific Ocean, and its power diminishes.
So it is expected to land in Mexico as a tropical storm in the afternoon on Monday or Monday evening.
In some areas of Mexico, there is a potential for high rainfall, with a significant risk of floods.
“The waste is expected from 7.5 to 15 cm in Baja California and into the northwest part of Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 cm of waste,” said the report from weather.com.
Rosa will then stay north of Mexico, a tropical storm, and reach Arizona’s border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical region, then continue up through Arizona and reach southern Utah late on Tuesday evening.
“ The primary danger expected from Rosa or its remains is a very high yield in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora, and in the southwest of the United States’ desert region, ” said a Hurricane Center.
This yield is expected to cause life - threatening rapids and movements on the soil of the deserts, and it is expected to travel to the mountains.

Trump says that Kavanaugh “fell to feel the evil and the wrath — from the Democratic Party
“Kavanaugh’s support measure is a vote rejecting the ruthless and shameful ways of the Democratic Party,” said Trump at a meeting with supporters in Wheeling, Western Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “fell to feel the evil and the anger — from the Democratic Party out of his entire process of worship.
Kavanaugh bore witness to the council on Thursday, where he harshly denied the accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that he harassed her sexually a few decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also bore witness to the committee about his accusations.
The president said on Saturday that “Americans had seen genius, dignity, and courage — Kavanaughs the other day.
“The decision to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that confirms one of the most clever lawyers of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record of careers as an official employee,” he said to the group of his supporters in Western Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh’s appointment when he spoke of the importance of participation by Republican supporters in the mid - term negotiations.
“ There are five weeks in one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don’t offer myself, but I really do, ” he said.
“That’s why I’m going everywhere to fight for great candidates —
Trump claimed that the Democratics were working on “twisting and blocking”
The first key vote on the U.S. Department's floor on Kavanaugh's appointment is to be held no later than Friday, according to the Republican leaders in an interview with CNN.
Hundreds of people died after an earthquake and a tide in Indonesia, and likely the number of dead will rise
At least 384 were killed, and many were swept away by vast waves on the shores, when a great earthquake and flood struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach in Pala on Friday, when up to a hundred feet [6 m] high were on the beach at sunset, spraying many people into the sea, and destroying everything that happened to them.
The flood developed after an earthquake of 7.5 degrees in Richter.
“ When the flood wave occurred yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they died, ” said Sutpo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster conference.
“ The flood did not come alone, pulled cars, wooden drum, a house, shelled everything on land, ” Nugroho said, adding that the flood wave had traveled across the open ocean at 800 miles [800 km] before going to the beach.
Some climbed into a tree to escape the tide and survive, he said.
Some 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Pala.
Air photographs published by the disaster agency showed many ruined buildings and shops, twisted and waste bridges, and moss surrounded by water.
Afterquakes continued to ride across the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were reported in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian establishment for food and technology, declared that the force released in the great earthquake on Friday had been about 200 times the size of the atom bomb that fell on the city of Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city at the end of a long and narrow flea could have increased the size of the flood wave, said the Institute.
Nugroho said the damage was “real, and thousands of houses, hospitals, malls, and hotels had collapsed.
A few victims ’ bodies were found trapped under a crash of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the loss and property damage could be greater along the coast line 300 km north of Pala in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake’s uptake.
Communication “became completely low and no information was received — from Dongala, Nugroho said.
“ Over 300,000 people live there, ” said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to that region.
“ It has already become a tragedy, but it could get much worse, ” said the Red Cross.
The Agency was criticized by many on Saturday for not letting out the fact that a flood wave had crashed on Pala, although public officials said that the waves had arrived within the time of the warning.
In a video published in the community media, you could hear a cry from the upper floor of a building to warn the people on the street below that a flood wave was approaching.
Just minutes later, the flood wave strikes on the beach and carries away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the video immediately.
The earthquake and the flood wave caused powerlessness that hindered communication with Pala and made it difficult for the authorities to organize relief work.
The army is starting to send aircraft with relief products from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but people who have been helped by the area still need food and other necessities.
The airport has only been opened up for relief and will be closed until October.
Mr. Joko Widodo, President of the United States, is visiting refugee centers in Pala on Sunday.
The number of deaths exceeds 800 after a flood in Indonesia.
Things are very bad.
The staff of the World Vision from Dongala have reached the city of Pala, where it seeks refuge in tent cities that were set up in the park outside their offices. The destruction was on their way, according to Mr. Doseba.
“ People said they saw many houses completely destroyed, ” he said.
Things are very bad.
Help groups have started a difficult relief work, but some have complained that foreign - trained relief workers were prevented from traveling to Pala.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel may only begin if the accident area is declared a disaster area.
It hasn't been done yet.
“It’s still a local accident area, ” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared that this is a disaster area, we can open for foreign assistance, but no statement has yet been made —
When the second night fell upon Pala after the earthquake and the Flood on Friday, friends and their missing families kept hoping that their loved ones would be one of the miracle stories that cast hope on the dregs of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a gutter.
On Sunday, relief workers saved a woman who had been trapped for two days with her mother’s body at her side.
Gendon Subandano, a trainer of the Indonesian Flying Team, had been trained as two missing flyers for the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mr. Mandagi.
“ As a man with a long experience in drifting, I have my own emotional burden to bear, ” he said.
Mr. Gendon reported that the hour after news arrived within the flight team because the Roa Roa Hotel collapsed, he had sent whatsApp a message in despair to the contestants who stayed in Pala and participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages showed only a gray mark, instead of a blue one.
“ I think it means that the messages were not received, ” he said.
Thief to steal $26.750 from Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed $26,750 from an employee named Brink, who was filling in a Newport on the Levee, as reported by the Newport police.
The driver of the car had been emptying a ATM in the entertainment area and was about to make more money on him, said Detective Dennis McCarthy, in the announcement.
When he was doing his job, another man came “running to the rear of the Brink employee — stealing a money bag intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects flee the scene according to the report, but the police did not give up the number of people involved.
Anyone who might have information about the suspect is asked to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rappar changes his name in Ye
The rapper Kanye West is going to change his name - into Ye.
He announced the change in Twitter on Saturday and wrote: “The world previously known as Kanye West...
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time, using the name as the title of the eighth album that came out in June.
The change will happen to his participation in the Saturday Night Live component where it is expected that he will announce his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grandi in the show, but for “emotional reasons ” she gave up the profanity.
West has previously said that this name has a religious meaning for him, but it is also a shortcut to his present name.
“ I believe that “yes — (you) is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you, ” said West earlier in the year when he spoke his name to Big Boy, the radio player.
\"So I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the one, and into just Ye--to be just a reflection of the good in us, the evil, the confused, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are —
He is one of many famous rapists who have changed his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former Collaborator West, has also written his name both with and without bounds and uppercase.
The elected president of Mexico promises not to use the military against the civilian population
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military force against ordinary citizens, now that the country will soon remember the 50th anniversary of bloody revenge on students.
On Saturday in the Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised to “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people...
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot at a peaceful protest march in the square and killed up to 300 people in time when students ’ left - wing movement was shooting roots across all Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico by giving all students monthly strength and opening up more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of study opportunities attract young people to crime.
The United States of America should double its artificial funding
Now that China is increasingly active in the use of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount of money it spends on research into that field, says the inventor and the artificial user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after various U.S. government departments published reports on artificial intelligence, even though the United States does not have a formal comprehensive artificial plan.
China, on the other hand, announced its plan last year: it aims to be first in the process of innovation with artificial recognition by 2030.
“ It would be a good start to double the funding involved in artificial research, compared to the fact that all other countries are so much further behind the United States, and we are waiting to see the next major discovery in the field of artificial intelligence, ” said Lee.
A double rate of funding could double the chances of the next major discovery in artificially identified U.S.A., said Lee to CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month by the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the president of the Sinovation Ventures company, which has invested in Face++, one of the major intelligent companies in China.
He worked on a satellite system in the 1980 ’ s at Carnegie Mellon University, which won the best player in the United States in Othello, and later he was director of Microsoft Research and president of Google’s Chinese Department.
Lee spoke of previous technology competitions held by the U.S. government, such as the robotic defence competition, and asked when the next race would be held to identify the next primary.
Scientists in the United States often have to work hard to gain strength from the government, says Lee.
“ It is not China that grabs the main ideas, but the companies, ” said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired college geniuses to work with artificially diagnosed last year.
Lee said that changes in immigrant policy may also help the United States to strengthen its artificial research.
“ I feel that those with a medical degree should be allowed to stay automatically, ” he said.
In July 2017, China’s Congress published its programme for future identification.
China’s Institute of Natural Science provides funds for people working at universities, similar to the National Science Foundation, as do public institutions in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China, says Lee.
In the past year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a satellite technology centre, which is designed to cooperate with both industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on artificial engineering.
And in those months, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion on a project called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it invests more than 100 million dollars annually in artificial research.
At the same time, the United States legislation, which was designed to provide a safety advice on artificial intelligence, has not continued for many months.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the country’s name
The residents of Macedonia chose to take a national decision on Sunday on whether to change the country’s name in the “Nordic Macedonia” in an attempt to resolve decades of conflict with Greece, which has closed their application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, by the name of Macedonia, claims that their name in the north is equivalent to that of their territory and thus refuses entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name, but nationalistic opposers argue that the change will undermine the self - image of the majority of Macedonian people of slavery.
Mr Ivanov, President-in-Office of the Council, has said that he will not participate in the vote and campaign to ignore it has raised doubts that participation will reach the 50% minimum necessary so that the vote is valid.
The question on the campaign bill is this: “Do you want to go to Nato and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including Mr Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister, say that this is a fair price for Macedonia for membership of the alliances such as the EU and Nato, but the country is one of those formed after Yugoslavia’s fall.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country for the young people of Macedonia so that it can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although the conclusion is not legally binding, many congressmen have said that they will comply with it and bind it to law.
The change in names would require the approval of two thirds of the House.
The campaign committee said that nothing unusual had been announced at 1:00 a.m.
However, the participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last congressions in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters paid their votes.
“ I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe, ” said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old in the capital of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in the Macedonian Parliament on whether to change the country’s name, which would allow it to enter the NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepared a small field and set up chairs in front of tents that had been built by those who would ignore the vote.
“We are in favour of Nato and the EU, but we want to become members with our heads high, not going through the service door,” Kavardarkov said.
“ We are a poor land, yet we have a resurrection.
If they refuse to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to something like China or Russia and become part of an Eurasian relationship —
The Prime Minister of Zaev says that membership of Nato will bring needed funding to Macedonia, where the rate of unemployed is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the vast majority will agree, because more than 80 percent of the country’s citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” said Zaev after paying his vote.
He said that consent “will be a confirmation of our future...
A survey report published on Monday from the Macedonian Policy Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the national order, which is less than the minimum required.
A second poll from the TV channel Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents were going to pay their vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said that they would say yes.
So the national order is valid, 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote is not adopted, this could mean the first serious shock to the government's policy, which is endorsed by the Western countries, since it took place last May.
See: Sergio Aguero, player Manchester City, goes through all the protection Brighton and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling lighted Brighton’s defense in the victory of Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored his goal in 65 minutes.
The Argentinian fortification received a shipment in the middle of the field at the beginning of the session.
He spewed past three defenders of Brighton and then went to the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green - colored defenders.
He passed by one of his defenders and then ran away from a few more just as much as Vititeig Brighton.
Then he sent to the left, and found Sterling there.
The English fortification used the first touch within the suite to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to play on Mathew Ryan, Brighton’s target, with a shot at the right side of the target.
“Aguero has some foot problems, ” said Pep Guardiola, director of City, to newsmen.
“ We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then this happened.
We were lucky he scored the goal at this moment —
But Sterling gave them the blue first goal of the first selection game.
That mark came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received a shipment deep inside Brighton's vault.
He sent a magnificent long ball on his left to Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball several times and sent it to Sterling to the far end.
A prominent city sent the ball into the net just before it ran out.
City attends Hoffenheim in the Master's Department at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a playoff game against Rockies
Since the national team has been excluded from playoffs, there was little reason to force a second start.
But the zealous Scherzer hopes to be thrown on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have the chance to make a final decision, but they have one-game head start on the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West.
Rockies received at least “wildcard” seats with her 5-2 win on the Nationals Friday night, but the team is still seeking their first department title.
“ Even if we play for free, we can at least play for an electric atmosphere in Denver, as well as the other team will probably play their best game this year.
Why shouldn't I want to compete in such situations?
Nationals will yet announce who will be the first to throw in the game of Sunday, but they are expected to let Scherzer throw in these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was about to start a game for the 34th time, took a rehearsal course on Thursday and would throw on Sunday, which is usually a Sabbath with him.
This right-handed caster in Washington is 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 blows in 220 2/3 cycles in this season.
Trump visits Western Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the case of Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court judge when he spoke of the importance of participation by Republican supporters in the mid - term discussions.
“ Everything is at stake in November.
There are five weeks in one of the most important elections of our lives.
These are one of the great, great... I do not offer myself, but I do, therefore, go around a wide range to fight for the wonderful candidates, he said.
Trump went on to say: “You see this terrible, radical group of democracies, you can see it happening now.
And they are determined to regain control by any means necessary, you see the cruelty, the evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go to get power and control, they just want power and control, we don't give it to them.
He said the Democratics were working to “twistle and block...
“ And it has been seen for the past four days, ” he said, “and he told the Democratics to be“ angry and cruel and untrue. ” —
He named the elder Diane Feinstein, the chairman of a democracy in the branch decision board, by name, and was answered with a loud bean from the audience.
“ Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who drew the document?
Oh, what.
No, look, I waited at one... it was really bad body language, the worst thing I've ever seen...
The team of workers is no longer an tolerant church.
He Does Notlerate Those Who Express His Mind
When Momentum of my group’s operations chose to commend me, it was hardly surprising.
After all, I am the last of many members of the union who have been told that we are not welcome, just to express our minds.
Joan Ryan, a fellow congressman, was treated similarly because she strongly protested prejudice against the Jews.
In my case, the appeal was made because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues were important for having a responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues, and Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Friday’s Nottingham East announcement said that “we want the meetings to be ineffective and effective,
In my eight - year career as a union congressman, Friday meetings have most often been just that.
Sadly, it is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of “milder and better — politics have been forgotten if they ever began.
It has become more and more evident that different opinions have not been passed in the Working Party and that all opinions are judged on whether they are acceptable to the leaders of the class.
This began soon after Jeremy became a leader, when employees, whom I thought had previously had similar political views, began to expect me to take complete turnover and support opinions that I had never agreed before, whether it was about national security or the common EU market.
Every time I speak publicly--and I don't care what I say-- it follows the reproach of the social media, where they call my exit, central government issues denied, and I told them I shouldn't be in the Works Party.
And this isn't just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, where most of the comments I get are usually political.
I admire professionalism and the affirmation of those who have to endure sexual or prejudiced insults every day but never retreat.
One of the greatest disappointments of this political period is the normalness of attacks and insults in everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn told me last week that the Worker’s Group should take care of an impenetrable culture.
The reality is that we are no longer an overbearing church, and with each motion of distrust or change in the rules, the group becomes increasingly indifferent.
Over the last two years, I have received many counsels that would dissuade me, not overly high, and then “all right — with me.
But I did not decide to take part in politics to do so.
Since I became a member of the Working Party as a student 32 years ago, encouraged by the neglect of the government of Thatcher, who left my classroom in the middle of the day, I have fought for better public service for those who need it most, whether I was in town or in a assembly.
I've never hidden my political views, nor at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my policies and where I disagree with current leaders.
With those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would just like to say that when the country is headed for Brexit, who will harm homes, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy in my loyalty to the leaders of the Works Group.
But my only message I would like to send from me is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to those within my choice, whether they are members of the Working Party or not: I serve you proudly and I promise that no threat of deviation or political exclusion will deter me from doing what I consider to be the best of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr’s undefeated team goes to the top
Two late touchdowns might have breached the final outcome something, but there's no doubt that Ayr had the victory in this short-term game of the day in the Tennent's Premiery department.
They are now at the top of the list and the only team of ten still undefeated.
Finally it was their stronger defense and better use of opportunities that made the locals more victorious, and Peter Murchie was fully entitled to be satisfied.
“ We have had severe opposition in our games so far and are still undefeated, so I have to be happy, ” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Ayr of praise, they took advantage of their opportunity better than we do,
Mark Grant Anderson came across at 14 minutes after Frazier Climo turned, but the yellow card on the Scottish staff, who was allowed to play the game with the Warriors, enabled Melrose to let the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot reached the touchdown.
Climo added to Ayr’s leadership with hell before he scored with a kick just before a half game and then a touchdown, and Ayr came across 17-5 in half.
But Melrose started the second half of power and touched Patrick Anderson’s touch, after Baggot turned around, the target difference decreased to five points.
Then a long break was needed to keep up with serious injuries at Ruaridh Knott, which had to be carried off the playground, and thereafter Ayr still increased his leadership with a touchdown from Stafford McDowall, after Climo turned the session around.
Blair Macpherson, Agent Ayr, then received the yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of being a man with a touchdown from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a tough application.
Homers, however, came back strong, and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for having taken the Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind the Ayr campaign, after an extra challenge.
Climo turned the call, as he did again immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe reached the kicker David Amrrrong from the Vititegeig and sent to Gregor Henry who scored the fifth touchdown of the team.
Star Still Game factors are ready for a new career in the restaurant
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game factors, seems ready to move to a restaurant after finding out he was hired manager of a restaurant company.
Kieran, 56, plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC’s popular show, which he writes and plays with his old partner from the entertainment business, Creg Hemhill.
The diocese has announced that the future ninth series will be the last and apparently Kiernan will have plans for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the manager of Akakmorn Limited.
The actor didn’t want to say anything about the story, but the source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to become a participant in “living restaurant bosses — City of Glasgow.
“ The sea is ours —: Bolivia’s beachless land hopes that a court will reopen the Pacific
Marines guard the fleet’s headquarters in La Paz.
General buildings flag blue flags.
A fleet station from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is marked as a slogan: “We have a right to the sea.
It's our duty to get it back.
On the other hand, throughout the entire landscaped Bolivian memory of the shoreline, which was lost to Chile in bloody conflicts in the 19th century, still remains in a fresh memory - along with the desire to sail again through the Pacific.
These hopes may be the strongest for decades, when Bolivia is awaiting a decision from the International Court of Justice in The Hague on October 1, after five years of legal proceedings.
“Bolivia has the power, the unity, and the vorality, and, of course, waits for the positive decision, ” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will monitor the ruling of the International Court of Justice on a large scale across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will decide in favour of Bolivia’s obligation to grant Bolivia access to the sea after decades of difficult conversation.
The decision on Monday is also very important for the president of Evo Morales, the Indian country, who will be fighting for the election next year.
“ We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he promised late August.
However, some branches consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and that it would little change if he did so.
The Court, which has headquarters in the Netherlands, has no authority to give a country from Chile and has ruled that the decision will not affect the outcome of the possible proceedings.
The fact that the court’s ruling is due only six months after the final talks indicates that the matter “had not been complicated, ” said Paz Sárate, a Danish expert in international law.
It is also possible that the last four years have not been the case with Bolivia to the point of progress, but they have caused the country to withdraw.
“ Bolivia’s current regime has stolen access to the ocean, ” Zárate said.
Morale’s captivating proverb has diminished all goodwill from Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after this.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged arms.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president of Bolivia and representative of the country of The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision had taken unusually short periods of time.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “a unique opportunity to open up a new relationship with Chile — and the opportunity to“ put an end to a conflict of 139 years back in time, both countries to benefit, ” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, another of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would be using this matter as a political issue.
“ Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific, ” he added.
“ The harvest is an opportunity to see that we need to recover from the past —
North Korea says nothing will happen to nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States of America.
Ri Yong Ho, Secretary of State North Korea says that the country will never take down its nuclear weapons until it can't trust Washington.
On Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly, Ri gave his speech.
He called on the United States to follow the promises they made at a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
His comments now come as Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, appear to be re-launching discussions on nuclear weapons, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea.
Ri says it is “dreaming — to think that continued business prayers and protesting the United States against a declaration of the end of Korea’s war will ever crush North Korea.
Washington does not wish to accept the declaration unless Pyongyang first intervenes in clear action to take down its nuclear weapons.
Kim and Donald Trump, President of the United States, both want to meet again at another meeting.
However, considerable doubts prevail that Pyongyang is serious about taking down weapons that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
The fashion shows in Paris present the latest line of big headwear that will come in fashion shops near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or stay completely hidden from the sun, you do not have to look any further.
Valentino and Thom Browne’s designers showed a number of strange, oversized hats for their SS19 lines on the fashion field, which attracted the nebula at fashion week in Paris.
In the summer, there have been a number of unsightly captivating images published on Instagram, and these designers have had their recent works of creation in view of fashion shows.
Valentino’s main work was a large light - brown hat with a wide range of bars that resembled the feather and covered the models ’ head.
Of other oversized items, watermelons were designed to keep the heat on their heads, with precious stones, seaman hats, and even pineapples.
Thom Browne also introduced a number of strange masks, just at the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were covered with a pair of lips that looked rather like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One mask resembled a slide - and - eye diver while others resembled a burning ice in a bread form.
If you want to bet on it, you're lucky.
The fashion experts predict that the big hats could soon be sold in fashion stores near you.
Big hats bring a dose to the heel of La Bomba - a iron hat with more than 60cm of large vessels that have adorned their heads from Rihanna to Emily Ratakowski.
The fashion mark behind the extremely unsightly hat seen in all the social media was inspired by another large component that appeared on the fashion field — a strawed beach bag that was almost as large as the swimsuit that carried it.
The orange straddler, with barbers and white leather handle, was the main part of La Riviera SS10, Jacquemus, in the fashion week of Paris.
Luke Armitage, the cast of the famous people, said in an interview with FEEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags appearing in fashion stores for the next summer - as the designer has caused such a big impact should be difficult to ignore demand for extras in excess -
John Edward: Language skills are essential for a world citizen
The colleges in Scotland are well known for their students ’ excellent achievements, and this has continued in 2018 with new, magnificent test results, which are still strengthened by individual and group achievements in sports, arts, music, and other social customs.
These schools have as many as 30,000 students throughout Scotland, with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) in defense of them, and they strive to provide their students and their parents with the best possible service.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further study, the career they have chosen, and their position as citizens of the world.
As a teaching tool that can put together and teach design programs, we see that new languages continue to be a popular study material in the schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, it touches his mind.
If you speak to him in his native tongue, it touches his heart —
This is an important reminder that we cannot rely solely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s test results show that languages are at the top of the lists with the highest proportions of students who pass tests in private schools.
68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages were awarded the A.
The data collected from 74 schools within the SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the gift certificate in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received the grade A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages, which will surely require the necessary skills for children and young people in the future.
At the moment, languages such as an article are placed in the same place as scientific subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
In 2014, a survey report by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that for the reasons given by employers, the lack of language skills was 17 percent.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future activities.
Now that more and more jobs require language skills, this ability is needed in a global world.
No matter what careers people choose, they will have a real advantage in the future if they learn another language, a knowledge that lasts forever.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a head start to the competitors.
According to a poll that YouGov made in over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent of them could not speak any other language well enough to hold conversation, and French was the only language spoken by two literal percent, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for today’s children to invest immediately in language teaching.
More weight, especially in recent lands, will give children a better chance to find a meaningful job.
In Scotland, the languages they teach differ from one school to another.
A certain number of schools will focus on classical new languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important to Britain by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interests lie, he will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with specialized teachers.
The Scottish private schools commit themselves to offering a study environment, which will prepare children and prepare them with the knowledge they need to achieve their success, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be denied that at this time, in a global business environment, languages continue to be necessary for the country’s future, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern language should really be viewed as “international ability to communicate ”
Private schools will continue to offer choice, variety, and superiority for Scotland’s young people.
I faut bien le faire.
John Edwards is the chairman of the Scottish Private School Council.
LeBron plays his first game for Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The waiting is about to end for fans who want to see LeBron James play their first game for Los Angeles Laker.
Luke Walton, the coach of Lakers, has announced that James will play on Sunday in the opening game of the season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has not yet been decided how many minutes he will play.
“ It’s going to be longer than a minute and shorter than 48, ” said Walton on Laker’s official website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for Lakers, told Twitter that James would probably play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his six-game schedule for Laker for the start of the season.
“ During this period of my career, I don’t have to play games for the season to prepare for me, ” he said.
Timer for election meeting Trump in West Virginia and YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will hold a lot of campaign meetings and the first one is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five organized meetings next week, where he will also stop in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his election to the new Supreme Court judges has been suspended, the Trumper will focus on building support for the next mid-term review, because the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the Congress when a vote is taken in November.
What time is the election meeting of Trump in West Virginia, and how can you watch him online?
The meeting of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, should begin at 7 p.m. to Eastern Time tonight, Saturday 29 September, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia on the Internet below via direct YouTube broadcast.
It is likely that the Trump trial against Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court judge, in which the charges of sexual harassment were brought against him, and the ruling of the Senate to confirm him as a judge was suspended for up to a week while the FBI investigates the charges.
But the main goal of Trump’s meetings is to help the Republicans get in a better direction, but they wait for difficult elections in November.
Hence, the announcement from Trump’s campaign that these five meetings that will be held next week had the goal of “filling volunteers and supporters of zeal as the Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and in the Assembly, ” according to Reuters’ news office.
“ The government of the Assembly is so essential for the President’s plan that it will travel to as many companies as possible now that a busy campaign period begins, ” said an unnamed spokesman from the Tromp campaign at Reuter’s press office.
The meeting tonight will be held at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling and is expected to be held by supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and the press from Pittsburgh, ” according to West Virginia Metro News.
The Saturday meeting will be another visit of Trump to West Virginia this month, but it won by more than 40 percent in this state in 2016.
Trump wants to try to help Patrick Morrissey, the representative of the Republicans in Western Virginia, to the Senate, but he's down below in the polls.
“It is not good for Morrissey to know that the president needs to come and try to increase his popularity,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuter’s news office.
Ryder, the 2018 Cup: The United States is showing a willingness to keep hope alive for the individual competition on Sunday
After three one - sided laps, the late Saturday fourth could be just what was needed in this Ryder Cup competition.
Success swings are a sport term that has been invented and that players truly believe in, and never more than in the competitions like this.
Where would they say that success lies now?
“ They had a six - point front and now it’s four points, so the success is rather on our side now, I guess, ” said Jordan Spieth when he set off for the competition today.
Of course, Europe is ahead of it, four more steps ahead with another 12 at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth said, believe to have a little wind in their sails, and they can be hopeful over many, especially at Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each got three points out of four.
Spieth has played wonderfully ever since he was flattered and leads by his example.
The preaching campaign increased as it went on the ring and he put down an important pillow to shepherd all four stages of the game after he and Thomas had been two points below after two games.
His puddle, which gave them victory in the 15th hole, had a similar shout of joy, a shout of the kind that tells you that he believes that the American team has not yet hoped for victory.
“ You just have to dive deep and think about your own game, ” said Spieth.
That's all these players can do right now.
18 holes to win points.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas for the past two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable story of Ryder the Cup.
This strange but fascinating European couple have won four of four games and can do nothing wrong.
“Moliwood — was the only couple who had their late afternoon dandruffs on Saturday, but they also managed to avoid ripples on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon, and on the nine-hole field on Friday morning.
The game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from loud audiences clearly show that they are the couple who have to win on Sunday, and there would be no popular player to seal the potential victory of the European team than Fleetwood or Molinari, the sun sits over the Le Golf National Field.
The best option would be for both to do so at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson easily took Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourth in the morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
In the first nine holes, the Spanish and the Swiss dug into a hole that they could never scratch.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The violins and the quads are so exciting to watch in close proximity because of the communication between couples, their advice, the advice they do not give, and how a program can change into a single field.
Europe has played better than it has so far and has a considerable advance before the end of the day, but this fourth race also showed that the United States team has the will to fight that some had doubted, especially other Americans.
Europe with 10-6 leadership for the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good head start before the closing day of Ryder the Cup after a quadruple and a fourth Saturday, with a 10-6 front line against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, a superstar, brought the attack with two victory over the challenged Tiger Woods, and have gained four points on the Le Golf National field.
The European team of Thomas Bjorns, who would like to regain the prize cup, which it lost on the Hazeltine field two years ago, showed great superiority over the U.S. team in the fourth ball of the morning and won the 3-1.
The United States demonstrated greater resistance in the quads and won two games but failed to work out the ladder difference.
Jim Furyss’ team needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to continue.
Fleetwood is the first European new team to win four consecutive points, and he and Molinari, who had the nickname “MolIwood — after a great weekend, are only one couple who win four points from their first four games in Ryder’s history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the quadruple game, they showed a great team and won Woods and U.S. rookie Bryson Decambaau 5-4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed his genius on occasion, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in quadruple games and fours and seven consecutive games.
Justin Rose, who was famished for tomorrow's four-ball game, returned to her partner Henrik Stenson in the quads and won 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are in the first and third place on the list of the best golfers in the world.
Yet, Europe did not benefit on this mild and spacious day of southwest Paris.
A triple winner in the golf race, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the goal for Americans by two points on Saturday.
They worked in difficulty 2-1 against Jon Rahm from Spain and Ian Poulter in quadruple games and later came back and won Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the quads after losing the first two holes.
It has only occurred twice in Ryder’s story that a team has won four different points at the start of an individual competition, although Fury’s team would only need an allotment to continue the cup.
On the other hand, after two days of second - hand visits, it appears that a counterattack on Sunday would be excessive.
North Korea says one-sided disarmament - impossible - without confidence
On Saturday, the Secretary of State of North Korea told the U.S.S.S. that continued business prayers would only run on their trust in the United States and it would be impossible for the country to take down its nuclear weapons one-sided under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the Annual General Assembly of the United States that North Korea had taken on “a considerable effort to show good will — in the past year, for example, by stopping nuclear and missile tests, taking down the nuclear test area, and promising to risk developing nuclear weapons and nuclear technologies.
“ In fact, we have not seen any similar reaction from the United States, ” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no doubt about the safety of our country, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to take down our nuclear weapons one-sidedly first —
Although Ri had repeated familiar North Korean complaints about opposition to Washington to “stranged ” nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded for every step of that instrument, his statement seemed to be special in that he did not deny a one - sided nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang had done earlier.
Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump referred to a joint statement at their first meeting between Presidents of the United States and North Korean leaders, in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work on “the nuclear disarmament of the Koreanskagan — and Trump issued a promise to ensure the safety of North Korea.
North Korea has sought solutions to formally end the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must leave its nuclear weapons behind first.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax a strict business ban on North Korea.
“ The United States demands that “nuclear disarmament takes place first — and increases pressure by using business prayers to achieve its goal, and even protests the declaration to end the war, ” said Ri.
“ Only dreamers know nothing about us to think that a business prayer can bring us to our knees.
But the problem is that continuing business prayers increases our confidence —
There was no mention of plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump, who the U.S. leader spoke of earlier this week at the U.S.R.
Instead, the minister spoke of three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, South Korea’s leader for the past five months and added: “If the party to this nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea instead of the United States, then the case of nuclear disarmament in the Koreans would not be this finale, ” he said.
Despite this, in his speech, Ri was very different from his speech last year when he said to the U.S. General Assembly that it would be inevitable to aim rockets from North Korea on to the United States continent after “the devilish president — Trump called Kim the Fireman — in a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened to “destruction — North Korea, but this year he praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that there was still much work to be done and that business prayer had to continue until North Korea had destroyed all its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time limit and said: “If this takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter —
China and Russia say that the U.S.S.S. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, told the U.S.S. Security Council: “The Security Council must continue to apply until complete nuclear disarmament has taken place and it confirms:
The Security Council agreed to step up its business relations with North Korea as of 2006 in an attempt to close the funding of the Pyongyang nuclear and missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline of the UN General Assembly and later said that he would be visiting Pyongyang again next month to prepare another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that success had been achieved, but only a few hours later North Korea condemned him for doing “crime demands”
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to take down the missile and nuclear power stations if the United States took action on “consistent measures”
He said that Kim had said that the “consistent actions — which he sought — were guarantees of security promised by Trump in Singapore and operations towards normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course in sufficient rest
A new Harvard university course has given all students more sleep in an effort to resist the growing tendency of students to stay awake and learn all night with the help of caffeine tablets.
A study revealed that students at the world’s best university often know little or nothing when it comes to the basic things about thinking about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep at Harvard Medical School and expert at Brigham and the Women’s Hospital, developed the course, and believes that it sees the first species in the United States.
After giving a lecture on the effects of a lack of sleep on his ability to study, he had the idea of doing the study.
“ At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and asked: “Why is this to be said to me first now, in my final year?
She said that no one told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me, “he said to Tellegraph.
The first time this year, the study explains to students the basics of how good sleep helps study ability and performance in sports and even promotes a general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychotherapy at Harvard Medical School and the director of the school’s health care ministry, said that the university decided to introduce the course after learning that students were very sleepy over the week.
The study is an hour of length and involves a number of interactive projects.
In part, there is a picture of a room at home, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how performance in sports can worsen during a lack of sleep, along with the importance of a good bus before sleeping.
In the second part, participants are told how lack of sleep for a long time may increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
In addition, maps of the school area with interactive signs encourage participants to think about their daily routine.
“ We know that this will not change the conduct of students in the same way.
But we feel that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes, so we feel that they are entitled to know. — added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that favors those who wake up and learn all night is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever - increasing pressure on students meant that sleep shortages were growing problems.
Making enough sleep with good quality should be “secret weapons — students to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, ” he said — even to avoid fatening, because lack of sleep adds to the brain’s call for food, so that the body is alert.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler put together the course, but he sat down one of his professor's cows last year in Harvard his first year.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and urged him to call for a course for all students in school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all the Masters to complete a similar course before they study at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm clock that reminds them to go to sleep, and to awaken them, bearing in mind the harmful effects of blue light given by electronic displays and LED lights, which can confuse the inner clock of the body and lead to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark of Menga shoots down Gerard's men
Rangers were still in trouble on the outskirts as Steven Gerrard's team had to settle for a 1-0 loss on Livingston, after a goal from Dolly Menga.
The team Ibrox wanted their first victory on the field after his victory at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard's team only their second loss in his 18 games as manager. The team is now eight points behind Hearts, which is at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiery.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half game, and Ranger's team seemed to lack all inspiration and was never likely to level.
The Rangers now fall down to the sixth position, but Livingston goes up to the third and is only behind Hibernian in target difference.
Rangers might face further problems after the lineman Calum Spence needed attention because of head injury after some item was thrown into him from the guest's vault.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr away and came to the farthest part of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, kept to the same Life 11 setup that reached the stage of Hearts last week and he had been pleased with the way his well - trained team was wrotting over the opposition.
Rangers might have had more with the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the ball it reached.
They should have scored just two minutes after the playoff when the first transmission from Menga came Scott Pitman in front of the Allan McGregors' goal, but he shot by.
Long extras from Keaghan Jacobs ended up at Craig Halkett, while his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, shot by the far end.
Rangers regained control of the game but seemed to live rather in hope than faith in their game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morales certainly thought he should have received hell when a quarter of the game was over, when he and Steven Lawless brought together, while Judge Steven Thomson pointed the call from the Colombian.
Rangers only achieved two targets in the first half, while Liam Kelly, former Ibrox, did not need much to defend the baldness of Lassana Coulibaly and easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Even though a 34th - minute opportunity from Livi would have occurred despite the other side of the race, no one can deny that they understood it, but only because of their endurance.
Rangers again failed to do anything from Jacob's long extra.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm and chose to send to Menga which then scored easily.
Gerrard took up half a game and sent Ryan Kent into the place of Coulibaly, and the exchange took effect almost immediately as the back guard entered Morelos, but Kelly quickly reacted and ran forward to shutting down the shot.
Livingston continued, however, to trick the guests into playing just the type of game they enjoy playing, and Lithgow and Halkett reached each long transmission.
Holt’s team could have increased their leadership at the end of the minute, but McGregor did well to deny Jacob’s opportunity before Lithgow ran to the corner.
Glenn Middleton, Ranger's deputy, wanted another hell when he and Jacobs collapsed, but Thomson referred it from back.
Almanak: The man who invented the Geiger counter
Here comes a page from our calendar “Sunday Morning ”: September 30, 1882, some 136 years today, and AFRA... This is the day that future geiger, a geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of studying and measuring radioactivity, and that invention eventually led to a device called Geiger meter.
The Geiger standard has been established in the scientific world since then but was also popular in pop culture, for example in the film “Bells of Coronado — 1950, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in unlikely roles as scientists:
Man: “What the hell is this?
Rogers: “This is Geiger meter, used to find radioactive substances such as uranium.
When you put these earpieces on you, you can hear the effect from the atoms due to radioactivity in the stones -
Evans: “It certainly breaks now —
“ His — Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New vaccine against cancer can teach your immune system to “see — hazardous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach your immune system to “see and kill dangerous cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to know dangerous cells as part of the treatment
Treatment includes taking immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then “see a protein that is common in many cancer cells and is then injected back into the patient.
Experimental vaccines have shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months. The vaccine teaches immune cells to know dangerous cancer cells.
The method involves taking immune cells out of the patient and changing them into a laboratory so that they can “see a protein called HER2 found in many types of cancer, and then return the cells to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the United States Institute of Cancer, Bethesday, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that the vaccine is very effective —
HER2 “is causing various types of cancer to cease to grow, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon, ” said Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach in which immune cells are taken from patients and known to be “onset cancer cells” has been effective in treating one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West gave a long monologue in support of Trump and carried the MAGA hat after appearing on the SNL television program.
It didn't end well.
On Kanye West, in his studio in Saturday Night Live, he praised the president of the United States, saying that he would volunteer for the president in 2020.
After moving the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, where he carried the Make America Great hat, he spoke for a long time against the Democrats and repeated his support of the Trump.
“ I’ve talked so often to white people who say: “How can you like Trump, he’s a race hater —
If I was worried about racial hatred, I would be long moved from the United States, ” he said.
The SNL started with a pole, where Hollywood star Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the branch judicial committee for accusing Christine Blasey Ford of sexual harassment.
Although the long - end West was not sent out, the recording of it was put on a social center by a comedian named Chris Rock.
I don't know if Rock wanted to make fun of West by publishing the tape.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had received bad backstage receptions because of his selection of hats.
“ I was put in a lonely backstage.
They told me: “Don’t go up to the stage with that cap —
They left me alone!
Then they say that I am in a deep hole, “he said, according to news from Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the deep hole — and say that he would put on his superhero coat — because that means you can’t order me for actions; do you want the world to progress?
Test Your Love —
According to Variety, his comments were received by an audience at least twice, and one of the actors of the SNL seemed shameful, and one of the participants said to the newspaper: “There was a silence in the studio —
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his formal appearance as he sang the song of Love It, dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from Candice Turner, a conservative class of TPUSA, who said on Twitter: “To one of the bravest souls: A THANK YOU TO SUSH THE MUSH —
But the chat room manager Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was simply being “he himself and that’s absolutely wonderful”
“ But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his “list — his) that I feel is supporting and spreading the ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
So are we, ‘ she added.
Before the exhibition, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now “the creature previously known as Kanye West”
He is not the first artist to change his name and foot in the footsteps of Diddy, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion, and must not be forgotten the music legend Prince the vow, who changed his name in symbol and later called himself the artist previously known as Prince.

He continued: “What is born in birth, and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets that make young boys feel as if they must be made by a man?
I think it's one of the most important questions of the day--how do we do this?
Because it is obvious that something has gone wrong in young men —
He also admitted during the interview that he would not play on any other component after the series resembles the next summer and said that he had received “a lot of battlefields and horses ”

HIV/Effect: China reports a 14% increase in new infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people infected with the HIV virus or AIDS.
Health officials say that over 820,000 people are infected in the country.
Some 40,000 new infections were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new infections were sexually transmitted, which is a change from what was before.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly to some parts of China because of donors of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected by the HIV virus in this way has fallen to almost zero, as Chinese health care professionals spoke at a convention in the province of Yunnan.
However, the number of people infected with the HIV virus or AIDS has increased by 100,000 people from year to year.
Sex - related HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but considerable discrimination against LGBT continues to occur.
Because of the persistent state of affairs, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who engage in sex with other men finally marry a woman.
Many people become infected because of inadequate contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised access for everyone to anti-HIV medicines as part of a plan to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses that an employee leaked data from the senators of the Republicans, criticises “hazardous lies — and“ conspiracy teachings ”
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, a congresswoman denied the charges that one of her employees had published the personal information of the three Republics of the Republicans on their Wikipedia pages.
The “Democrat ” from Los Angeles said that these claims came from“ high - right - minded people — extremes and web sites.
“ Liars, lies, and more pathetic lies, ” said Waters in a public declaration on Twitter.
The information published contained, according to the addresses and telephone numbers of the U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published on the Internet on Thursday from an unknown party on Capitol Hill during the hearings with the Senate department at Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court judge’s committee, for the charges of sexual harassment.
Some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh, the play came.
The conservative pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said that the IPs identifying the source of the information have been linked to Water's office and published information about one of its employees, according to the information from Capitol Hill.
“ This unscrupulous accusation is totally false and pure lies, ” said Waters.
“My boss — what personal information and safety is now at risk because of these false accusations — was in no way responsible for this spillage of information.
This unscrupulous accusation is totally false and a false lie —
Waters’ announcement was quickly criticised on the Internet, including Ara Fleischer, the former White House News Officer.
“ This denial is filled with anger, ” wrote Fleischer.
“ This indicates that she has no sense of temper to sit on a meeting.
When a person is accused without cause, he must not react with anger.
There must be no opposition.
That is not to be asked for the cause of the charge.
It must be calm and calm —
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Water to the criticism of the Democratics of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics said that had seemed too angry with the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the candidate Republicans against Waters in the mid - term negotiations, also commented on Twitter.
“ Big deal if true, ” he said.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had “identified the authorities and the law enforcement authorities of these false claims.
“We will ensure that the guilty will be found, ” she continued, “and that they will be held accountable for all the doings that are damaging and dangerous to all my employees —
Movie Criticism for Johnny English Strike Again - spy film with Rowan Atkinson proved weak
It is now common to look for Brexit references in all new films where Britain is dealing with history, and that seems to apply in this revitalization of the Johnny English comic book - which began in 2003 with the picture Johnny English and just woke back to life in 2011 with the picture Johnny English Reborn.
Will this kankvíra satir about how clearly miserable we are as a new export facility for the country?
Whether it is or not, the unearthed, greedy, and hoofy Johnny English has been renewed for another time to screw up all - his name shows above all that he is a creation designed for a display in other than English - speaking lands.
Of course, he is the wiser secret servicer who pretends to have fascinating personality powers but is a little mixed up by Clouseau, dass by Mr Bean, and a little deleted by the man who played one note for the Chariot of Four song at the London Olympic Games opening celebration in 2012.
It is also originally based on the tourist and the mysterious citizen of the world that Atkinsons once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, where he left everything in trouble.
There's one or two good points in this latest Johnny English picture.
I enjoyed watching Johnny English go to a helicopter dressed in Middle Ages, and the helicopter blades were in his helmet.
Clearly, atkinson shows his masculinity, but the humor seems rather powerless and strangely superficial, especially now “more serious — films such as James Bond and Mission Impossible pictures also offer unscrupulous jokes.
The joke seems to be more for children than for adults, and I found the adventures that Johnny English had not been as imaginary and focused as the silences of Atkinson in Mr. Beans' fake.
The permanent basis for the film now is that Britain is in great trouble.
A computer hacker has been able to break into Britain’s secret spy network and have identified the identity of all British spies, to a great extent for the spy on the watch - where, unfortunately, Kevin Eldon plays too small a role.
This is the final move of the prime minister, who is arrogant and controversial of a person and who is already in great trouble because of enormous political hostilities: Emma Thompson is doing his best by his role as a person to remind Theresa May, but the script is not for many fish for her.
Her counselors tell her that all active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who had been seated in a holy stone.
And that's where Johnny English himself comes to history, now head of school at some fine school, but also provides secret lessons on how to be a spy: Here are some funny jokes that English offers at a spy school that reminds me of the school of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets there Bough, his former long-tired partner, who Ben Miller plays again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine captain, but in that powerful role, Vicki Pepperdine does not quite get to let his light shine.
The spy-weed that screws everything up in the service of Her Majesty has now returned to the giraffe and meets Ophelia Bulletova, who is played by Olgu Kurylenko.
At the same time, the prime minister is to be impressed by the charming billionaires in the tech sector who claim to be able to solve Britain’s computer problem: it is the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their fallout journey: they set fire to a fine French restaurant disguised as a servant; they cause dissipation as they smuggle themselves into Volta's luxury yacht; and English turns everything upside down when he tries to use virtual glasses to study the interiors of Volta's house.
There is nothing to be saved in that final point, but although the picture is bold and energy-rich, there is some substance in it as a whole.
Moderate matter.
And just as with the other Johnny English pictures, I couldn't help but think: Can British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his abilities?
The task force refuses to make a four - day schedule for the British, with the same salary as it was five days ago.
The task force, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is now considering a radical plan that would allow the British to work for four days a week, but it will be paid for five.
According to the report, the company’s executives want to make use of savings generated from the artificial revolution, and to benefit employees by receiving one extra day’s rest.
Then employees may have a three - day weekend, without paying a salary.
Sources say that the idea “would fit into the economic programme of the category and its policy of improving the labour market.
For four days, the Trade Union Congress organization has supported the shortening of the working week, which allowed workers to make use of economic changes.
A head of the Task Force’s upper department said to the Sunday Times: “It is estimated that policy review will be announced by the end of the year.
“The shift will not take place overnight, but four days of work is a goal that fits with the approach of the class to change economies for the benefit of the workers and the overall industry policies of the category,
The task force would not be the first group to support this idea, but the Green Group promised a four - day week campaign in 2017.
However, the goal is not supported by the whole Task Force.
“ Four days of work week is not on the team policy, and the team is not considering introducing it, ” said one member of the Working Party.
Mr. John McDonnell, Minister for Economic Affairs, used the Working Party conference last week to describe his ideas on the social revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “unidentified presidents — and“ growers — companies. ”
The Secretary of the shadow also translates that present shareholders in water supply companies may not get all their things back, since the government of the Task Forces could contribute to “department — due to supposed iniquities.
He has also confirmed plans to put workers on the board of directors of companies and to create a common fund of ownership to provide 10 percent of the property of private companies to employees who could receive £500 of them each year in their pockets.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say \"60 minutes\" that investigating the FBI at Kavanaugh might change their mind.
An investigation by the FBI on the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a week's delay in the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court Judge, and raises the question of whether her findings might lead the Republican Senate senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that will be shown on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a news reporter on the show of 60 minutes — the Republicans and senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could reveal something that would change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his college from South Carolina.
\"I mean, of course, Kennedy said.
“ I said when the trial began, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After the charges were made, I called him and asked: “Do this —
He was firm, steadfast, distasteful —
Graham’s vote, however, seems unchangeable.
“ I have made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take an incredible accusation to change it, ” he said.
“ Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but this I know: Brett firmly refused, ” said Graham, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
“ And everyone she mentioned could not confirm that name.
This case is 36 years old.
I can't see anything new is gonna change.
What is the international festival, and has it done something to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be held on Saturday in New York City, New York, an annual music event in which a series of superstars will appear and have similar influential policies; eventually, poverty worldwide.
This is the seventh year that the international festival is held, and tens of thousands of people will move to Central Park, not only to listen to music items from, among others, Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real goal of ending poverty by 2030.
The first international festival in 2012 is part of the Global Poverty Project, an international fighting organization that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of those fighting it.
To get a free ticket on the event (except for those who want to pay for a VIP, concerters had to complete various tasks, or ‘operations’ — such as doing volunteer work, sending e - mail to one of the world’s leaders, making phone calls, or using other valid ways to help draw attention to their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the festival been, now 12 years from now, in reaching its goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with free concerts really a way to convince people to call for action, or is it just a so-called “melting operation” - where people think it's doing something that's important by signing a demand list on the Internet or sending a message on Twitter?
Global Citizen reports that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million operations — from its supporters, to call for a variety of different goals.
It says that these actions helped to make world leaders declare commitments and policies equivalent to over 35 billion dollars that will affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and notifications for its operations, of which at least 10 billion dollars have been invested or collected.
The group estimates that so far the accumulated funds had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One primary commitment comes from The Power of Nutrition, a company of investors and director in Britain who works to “help children to enjoy their full benefits, ” and promised to give 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country, after having received 4700 messages on Twitter from Global Citizens.
“With support from the Government of Britain, sponsors, governments all over the world and international citizens like you, we can leave the social injustices that are common to the past,” said Tracey Ulmann, representative of The Power of Nutrition to the audience at London concerts in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5,000 calls were sent for Britain to improve the nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the Power of Nutrition funding, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
The list of common questions on the website of the group asks the question: “Why do you think you can put an end to the sore poverty?
Global citzen replied: “It will be a long and difficult task - sometimes we will fail constantly.
But, we will achieve our goal, like movements that fought for citizens’ rights and the rejection of racial separation before us, because we are stronger together.
This year's events include Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monae. The event will be held in New York City and the participants will be Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Marines as “a barrier — to prevent Russia’s energy exports,” says Minister of the Interior
“If necessary, ” says U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke, “ Washington could use the Navy to prevent energy from reaching the market in Russia, including the Middle East. ”
Zinke claimed to assist Russia in Syria, especially where the country works in the legal service of the government there, was an opportunity to examine a new market.
“I think the reason for their existence in the Middle East is that they want to do business with energy like in Eastern Europe and its southern parts, — he should have said according to sources.
And, according to the official announcement, there are ways and methods to resist it.
“ The United States can use the Navy to ensure that sea routes are open and form obstacles, if necessary, to ensure that their energy is not released on the market, ” he said.
Zinke addressed a meeting in the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity group called “the voice of energy consumption — in the United States.
He continued and compared Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran and told her to be more or less the same.
“ The financial options for Iran and Russia are more and less used for energy supplies and to replace them with others, ” he said, “he said and said Russia has just one card in the memory of an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The announcements follow the fact that the Trumps administration wants to increase its exports of natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, public employees in the Trumps administration, including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to cancel the “ineligible — North Stream 2 project to launch a new energy pipeline, which Trump says would make Berlin “capture — Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly claimed that the 11 billion dollars North Stream 2 power supply, which will double the current transport capacity of up to 110 billion cubic metres, is merely an economic project.
Russia says that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is simply continued for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“ I think that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose for the producers, ” said Aleksandr Novak, Russian Secretary of Energy after a meeting with Mr. Rick Perry, U.S. Secretary of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The status of the United States has been criticised by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Federation of German Industries (BDI) has called on the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and a bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
“I’m very dissatisfying that a foreign government divided our energy sector,” said Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting with Angela Merkel, chancellor of Germany, and Vladimir Putin, president of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will “think seriously — to volunteer for the presidency in 2020,” she says.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, told her that she would “think seriously — to present herself to the president after the mid - term discussions.
Warren confirmed that she would consider volunteering for a convention in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“ It’s time for women to go to Washington and the order of our government, and then a woman is also needed as a leader, ” she reported from The Hill.
“After November 6, I will consider seriously presenting myself to the president’s office —
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump at the meeting and said that he was “to take the country in the wrong direction.
“ I am very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy, ” she said.
Warren has been mad at his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his Supreme Court judge.
On Friday, Warren on Twitter said, \"Of course we have to have the FBI investigate the matter before the vote goes on...
However, a survey report published on Thursday shows that the majority of the voters in Warren’s state of affairs do not think that it should volunteer in 2020.
Fifty - eight percent “likelier — voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not offer himself, according to a poll published by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty - two percent said they supported her offer.
The survey showed more support for Deval Patrick’s former governor’s offer, where 38 percent claimed to support his possible offer, and 48 percent claimed to oppose it.
Among other popular Democrats who were discussed for possible Presidential Proposals in 2020 were Joe Biden, former vice president, and Bernie Sanders, Senator of the Senate of Vermont.
Biden said that he would make a public decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin speaks of a shock disorder Track Palin at a election meeting at Donald Trump
26 - year - old Track Palin was in Iraq for one year after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
“ My son is going through a lot of trouble after returning, I feel sorry for other families who are affected by a stress disorder and the spiritual wounds our soldiers return home with, ” she said to the audience at a campaign meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

18 states and Washington D.C. support the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and Washington support a legal challenge against a new U.S. policy that rejects victims who flee the march or domestic violence in refuge.
According to NBC News, 18 and the city’s representatives filed a court report on Friday in Washington to support a poacher who protests policy.
The full name of the defendant in Grace v. Sessions Convention, which the American Civil Liberals Union has not presented to the federal policy, has not been given.
She said that her spouse, “and his violent sons who joined her, ” was violent, but her U.S. government employees rejected her application for refuge on July 20.
She was put in custody in Texas.
The supporters of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries where problems with walking and domestic violence are increasing, with a number of asylum seekers coming from these countries.
In 2014, the new asylum seeker's decision was revoked by the immigration appeal committee to allow unregistered immigrants who fled domestic violence to apply for refuge.
Karl Racine, D.C., declared on Friday that the new policy “was a decade of federal and international law.
“ The federal law requires a decision on all asylum applications based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this rule, ” said the trial report.
The law further stated in the report that the policy that denied admission would be harmful to the economy of the United States and claimed that immigrants would be more likely to set up a business and “maintain important labour force”
Jeff Sessions, the U.S. Attorney General, ordered immigrants to stop giving refuge to victims of domestic violence and violence in June.
“ Those who leave their homeland for persecution based on race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion can seek refuge, ” said Sessions in their June 11, issue.
Helmsmen were never meant to solve all the problems, not even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operations in the race to find survivors in Pala, numbering the dead double
Conditions are becoming increasingly difficult for survivors.
“ There is great excitement in the air, ” said Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, who comforted her sick son at the relief center in the city of Pala.
“ Hospitals bring dead bodies here all the time.
There is little about clean water —
The inhabitants were seen returning to their ruined homes, searching in their waterproof possessions to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals are overcrowded and damaged by the earthquake recorded at 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who was broken by the back and shoulder, lay outside the military hospital in Pala, where patients were favored from outside due to continued intense sequelae.
Tears filled his eyes as he related how he found the earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save ourselves.
I felt pressured to the walls, I think, “I told Haris Associated Press that his family had been in town to go to a wedding.
“ I heard my wife call for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe.
The U.S. Secretary of State blames China for “punishment — with“ misunderstandings ” —
A week after an official newspaper in China published a four - day American newspaper advertisement on mutual benefits in business relations between the two countries, the U.S. Ambassador in China Peking accused of using the U.S. media to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, spoke last Wednesday about the publication of the Chinese magazine in Des Moines Register, which is the most wasted newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to get involved in the U.S. congressionals on November 6, China denied this accusation.
The accusation that Peking wanted to get involved in the U.S. congresses was marketing what official U.S. officials told Reuters’ news office that there was a new stage in a growing campaign from Washington to exert pressure on China.
Although it is natural for foreign governments to publish adverts to promote business, Beijing and Washington have a growing business war, with new customs on both countries’ import products.
Chinese and American experts say that early in the commercial war, Chinese avengers were designed to harm the emigrants in countries such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trumps.
Terry Branstad, ambassador of the United States in China and former long - term President of Iowa, who is moving a lot of agricultural products to China, said that Peking had harmed American workers, farmers, and companies.
Branstad, in his article on Sunday’s Des Moines Register, stated that “China is now increasing its persecution by publishing propaganda ads in our own free media ”
“ By spreading its propaganda, China’s government is taking advantage of the loving freedom of speech tradition of the United States and our free media by publishing the cost of advertising in Des Moines Register, ” said Branstad in her article.
“ On the other hand, few protesters can be found in the magazine booths on the streets of Beijing, and no true reflection can be found of the various views that the Chinese might have on China’s worrying economic policy, since the media are trapped under the heel of the Chinese Communist Party, ” he wrote.
He added that “one of the largest newsmagazines in China escaped the offer to publish — his article, but he did not mention it.
Experts warn that the Republicans are making female voters stop them for the mid-term discussions on the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned of negative reactions, especially from women, in the next mid - term discussions, because many of the Republicans have supported and defended Brett Kavanaugh, named the Supreme Court Judge, who has been accused of sexual harassment.
Very strong emotions have been around this subject, and most of the Republicans have already shown publicly that they wanted to start voting.
“ These things cannot be backed up, ” said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the University of Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, of The Hill, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted the appeal to the Republican senator Jeff Flake at the last minute for an investigation by the FBI to calm down the voters.
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, director and spokesman for the liberal group MoveOn, Friday, according to Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang — November approaches — protesting in the ranks of the elders when the Republicans who ruled the decision board decided to proceed with Kavanaugh’s appointment, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
“ The interest and enthusiasm of the voters will go out of hand, ” said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political writer, on the news site.
“ People will say that interest has already been great, and it is true.
But he could be bigger, especially in women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who don't like the president, but rarely choose,
The analysts predicted a setback if the Republicans were to confirm Kavanaugh, even for Ford’s testimony, describing her accusations of sexual harassment.
“ This has become a big mess for the Republics, ” said Michael Still, former member of the Republic Committee of the Repubics, early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just the vote of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is allowed to sit on the bench, it’s also about how the Republicans have handled it and how they have dealt with it, ” said Guy Cecil, president of the United States of America, a group that helps to vote for democracy, at the news station.
On the other hand, the United States seems to disagree who should believe after a witness from both Ford and Kavanaugh, and almost a majority support the latter.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely believed, or probably believed, the testimony from Ford, while 35 percent claimed to believe, or probably, Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said that they computer Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied in their testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the call from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the charges that Ford made and from at least one other woman, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by the Guardian.
Ford gave an oath to testify before the branch decision board last week, saying that Kavanaugh attacked her when she was 17 years old and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says that Kavanaugh carried her genitals in front of her when they both attended a party that was attended by Yale University in the 1980 ’ s.
The man who invented the Internet has plans to start a new Internet to fight against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the net, is setting up a wreath company to fight against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The final project of the Antiquities of Technology, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, the open platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access which information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee, in a joke, said that the intent behind Inrupt was “the authority of the world.”
\"We have to do this now,\" he said about the scepter company.
\"This is a historic moment...
The program uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own personal data store — or POD.
This includes a list of contacts, task lists, calendars, music collections, and other personal and work-related devices.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all present in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal data store is that it is entirely below the user who can access which information.
The company calls it “personal influence by using data”
According to John Bruce, the president of the company, the idea that the company is providing resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to all is the idea.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security facility purchased by IBM, several programmers hired as contractors to work in the project, and a group of volunteers.
From this week onwards, technology developers worldwide could create their own independent programs using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team had no discussions with “Facebook and Google about whether to initiate a complete change that would put their current business model on their head in one night.
“We don’t ask them permission —
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published on Saturday at the Medium that Inrupt had it “to create energy in business and eco-systems to help protect the honesty and quality of the new website based on Solid”
Berners-Lee overturned the network in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an effective voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and president of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even while he gets up and down.
“I’m optimistic about the next period of the network, ” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: Priest and master of Victoria’s First World War
The only English priest to be honored with the Victorian cross during the first world war that a soldier has been hailed in his hometown 100 years later.
On September 29, 1918, Father Bernard Vann, in command of the undershepherd of the army, received the cross in the attack on Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
On the other hand, he was killed four days later by a sniper and was never told that he had received the highest honor of the British Army.
His two grandkids exposed him in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandfathers, Michael Vann, said it was “deeply symbolic — that the monument was exposed exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s glorious achievement.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Vann led his sub - Colonel army over the Canal de Saint-Quentin canal — through a very thick fog and under a severe gunfire from cannons and machine guns —
Later, he ran to the line of fire, and with “great courage, ” he led the line forward before attacking a cannon like his own and defeating three soldiers.
A commanding officer was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's heroics were something I could never do, but something that makes you humble --
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid the garland after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he was “a great honor to participate in the parade — and added that“ the very ones of true heroes are shown with the support so many show —
MMA fans woke up all night watching Bellator 206 instead of watching Guru pig
Just imagine, having woken up all night to see an overcrowded Bellator 206, just to be denied seeing the main event.
The program featured 13 battles from San Jose, of which six were on the main program and were broadcast live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British audiences were having unexpected events when the broadcast changed to Gurru pig.
Some were unhappy after waking up all night to watch the battle.
One fan on Twitter declared the exchange to be “any kind of a sick joke ” —
“ According to official rules, the subject was not fit for audiences at six o’clock in the morning, so they had to switch to children’s material,” said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communication for Bellator when he was asked into the broadcast.
\"Gurra pig, yes\"
Scott Coker, director of Bellator, said that they would go over their schedules and take viewers in Britain with them in the future.
“ I think that when I think about the reshow, we could probably figure this out, ” said Coker.
“ But there is six o’clock in the morning on Sunday there, and we cannot solve this until Sunday, which is Monday with them.
But we're working on this.
Believe me, when you changed the transmission, a lot of text messages were sent back and forth, and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix this. We thought this was a technical problem.
But it wasn't so, it was an official problem.
I can promise you this won't happen the next time.
We limited the evening to five fights instead of six, as usual, but we tried too hard and passed out.
This is an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “disgusting — due to sexual orientation.
Olympic drinker Tom Daley says that he felt a lack of strength toward other people in their upbringing because of their sexual orientation, but this encouraged him to succeed.
24 - year - old Daley said that he did not realize that “he was different from anyone else — until he went to high school —
On the Desert Island Discs radio program on the Radio 4 Channel, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said that he spoke of the rights of homosexuals to give others “hope ”
He also said that his role as a parent reduced his interest in winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular factoring director, has taken a few months off because of illness.
Daley went outside in the first part of Laverne and said that he felt that he was “a lesser man — but everyone else when he was a child because“it was not accepted in the community to be fond of both boys and girls...
He said: “All the way up to today, these feelings about feeling inferior and different have given me the strength and strength to succeed —
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when he finally found out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic Bridge has become a supporter of LGBT, using its participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more nations to legalize homosexuality.
He said that he would be heard because he felt lucky to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to give others “hope ”
The World Champion said that it “was surprising to him — to fall in love with the man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar Prize winner, 20 years older than he did last year than said that the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you go through so much at a young age — — but he participated in his first Olympic Games 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later — he said it was difficult to find peers who had experienced similar success and difficulties.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Dayy and Daley said that “all his life thoughts had been suppressed.
“ If you had asked me last year, everything was about winning a gold prize, ” he said.
“You know what, it’s more important things than a gold prize at the Olympic Games.
Robbie's my Olympic gold prize.
His son is baptized in the head of his father, Robert, who died in 2011, 40 years of age, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he would die, and one of the last things he had asked was whether they had finished getting his tickets for London in 2012--for he wanted to sit in the front row.
“ I couldn’t tell him that he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row, ” he said.
“ I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until his breathing stopped, and he was dead that I finally admitted that he wasn’t invincible, ” he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze award.
“I only knew that I had dreamed of it all my life, to dip me in front of the audience at home at the Olympic Games, and that doesn’t feel any better, ” he said.
It was also an inspiration to the choice of the first song--Proud by Heather Small--who had given him inspiration for the Olympics and still gave him the goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on the BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 p.m. to British local time.
Mickelson in bad shape, and he's been sat on the bench in Ryder the Cup on Saturday.
The American Phil Mickelson will score on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to find his old rhythm again so that bad memories are not appreciated.
Mickelson, who plays the contest for the 12th time, was put on the bench after his associate Jim Furkyk's decision for the quadruple games and quads on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the Hazar, as he has been so often before the United States, the five - time champion’s day is divided between being a cheerleader and practicing the playthings of the field, hoping to correct what is happening to him.
Mickelson, 48 years old, was never the one who shot with the killer, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National Golf Field, where longing globes often punished for bad shots.
And not only is the golf course a big challenge in itself, but Mickelson has to compete against Frances Molinari, the winner of the British Open, in the ninth game on Sunday.
If the four - point United States players take the first of 12 solo games to get started, Mickelson’s game could be a big deal.
Fury expressed confidence in his husband, but he could hardly say anything else.
“ He fully understood the role he had today, patted my back, and took hold of me, and said that he would be ready tomorrow, ” said Furyk.
“ He has great confidence.
He's in the famous palace, and he's been such a relief for the past week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I pictured more, but that's how it ended, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everybody else...
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in the number of games played in Ryder's cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a process in the Ryder Cup, which has never achieved just as well as other achievements on its record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and 7 strokes, but Furyk said that his presence had a certain vague effect on the race.
“ He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he likes to make fun of people, and it’s great to have him in the team room, ” he explained.
“ I think the younger players enjoyed fighting him, too, and it was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just the golf game...
Thomas Bjorn, the head of the European Union knows that a great advance can quickly disappear.
European colleague Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a good advance for the last day of the Ryder Cup individual contest can easily turn into unpleasant experiences.
The dance first played a game in Valderrama in 1997, where the head of Seve Ballesteros' team had a five-point front line for the United States, but had the right to claim victory at the end with the least possible score difference, with 141⁄2-131⁄2 wins.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advance in Valderrama, we had a big advance in Brookline where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, but only quite so,” said Bjorn, shown here in the film, after watching the 2018 vintage win 5-3 both Friday and Saturday and reaching the 10-6 lead at Le Golf National level.
History will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
We'll do everything we can tomorrow.
Let's go and do everything right.
This is not finished until all grades are on the tablet.
We have our goal and it's trying to win this cup, we focus on it
I've always said this, I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we're very aware of our opponents on the other team -- the best golfer in the world --
Bjorn was delighted with the hard way in which his laity had survived, adding: “I never get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow will be a different day.
Tomorrow it is the performance of the individuals, and that is another matter.
It's great to play with partners when everything goes well, but when you play one, every man's talent is tested as a golfer.
It's the message that needs to be sent to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and he also has to play his best game of his own.
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, will strive for his players to do better in individual games than with associates, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who worked three points out of four.
Fourk himself has experienced both sides of this major transformation last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brookline but ended up losing when Europe carried out the “power project in Medinah”
“ I remember every fucking word he said — how Ben Crenshaw, late in 1999, had continued to encourage his players for the last day.
“We need to play 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start fast, as happened in Brookline and Medinah.
As he gets closer to building up, he puts great pressure on the games that are in the middle.
We ordered our players according to it and let them play like we think they'll be doing the best tomorrow —
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defense and playing against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the first half of the games.
“ I chose these players in this order because I think they’re covered all the way through, ” said Bjorn of his choice for players in the individual contest.
The New German Warship Retired
According to local news reports, the latest German Navy military warships should have been built in 2014 to replace an old warship from the Cold War period, but it will not be ready until next year at first.
The building of “Rheinland-Palatinate,” the leadership of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg chain, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the sources of the military spokesman who spoke to Die Zeit magazine.
The ship was supposed to be in use by the Marines in 2014, but serious problems after the drop of the mission took place.
The four boats of the Baden-Wuerttemberg group ordered by the Marines in 2007 are to replace the Brenmen-class ships, which are due to their years.
They should be equipped with a powerful cannon, many anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft rockets and hide technology such as reduced radar infrared, and sound signals.
Other important features are longer use - the latest ships should be used for up to two years away from home.
However, constant delays mean that this new type of warship - which is said to enable Germany to show its strength at sea - would be obsolete when they are finally in use, says Die Zeit.
The F125 ship came up with the news last year when the German army officially refused to accept the flight and returned it to Blohm & Voss ’ release in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the divorce, but the German media spoke of a number of women who were seriously “missing software and hardware — who would make the military ship useless if sent to war.
Software faults were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warship will be operated by 120 crews, half as much as the Bremen-class military ships.
It was also found that the ship was far too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Marines to make improvements in the future.
The 7000 tons of ship “Rheinland-Palatinate” is thought to be twice as heavy as a ship of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware defects, the cost of the entire project - including training the crew - is starting to cause problems.
It is said that it reached EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion), but initially it was to be EUR 2.2 billion.
A problem facing the latest ships is particularly important in view of the warning that the excesses of the Germans in the sea are decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartel, the head of the German Parliamentary Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy was actually becoming “a body of capable ships”
The officer said that the problem arose over time, for older ships were removed, but no ships were replaced.
He lamented that none of the orders of the Baden-Wuerttemberg group could be used by the Navy.
National Trust Natural Protection Organization spying on the secret life of bats
A new study on the territory of the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how bats use the landscape when fishing for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland Association, will monitor different types of bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
A special recording device will be installed in key areas of the area to monitor the behaviour of the leather blades over the period.
NHS and volunteers will also be patrolling with handheld sensors.
Experts will record all the recordings in order to find out the frequency of the calls that the bats give out and what kind of people do what.
Maps of habitats and reports will then be published to create an accurate picture of their behaviour on a geographic scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS Night Overseas Adviser, hopes that the results will reveal what kind of habitat is most important for the bats and how they are used of each species.
These data will help to determine the benefits of management of habitats, e.g. by creating meadows and the best way to maintain forestlands for bats and other related species.
The number of bats has decreased considerably in the last century in Scotland and throughout Britain.
They are at risk from building and developing projects that affect their nests and reduce their habitats.
Windmills and light can also lead to risks, including flight paper and certain chemical treatments for construction materials, as well as domestic attacks.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their ears do much better than their eyes when it comes to hunting prey because they are used to hunting at night.
They use advanced metal marketing techniques to locate insects and objects on their flight path.
NTS, responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres [66,000 ha] of land all over the country, take bats very seriously.
Ten experts in the organization perform regular inspections, nesting examinations, and sometimes rescue operations.
It has even set up the first and only batland of Scotland at the Threave ranch in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten bats of Scotland have homes.
David Thompson, the garden overseer, says he is a perfect area for them.
“ The place here at Threave is great for bats, ” he said.
“ We have old buildings, plenty of growing trees, and lots of good habitats.
But there are still many things that are unaware of bats, so the work we work here and elsewhere will help us to understand better what they need to do to make sure that we do it —
He stressed the importance of checking for bats before continuing to live, since possible accidental destruction at one nest can kill up to 400 female bats and young people and destroy all bats in the area.
Bats are protected, and killing, harassing, or disrupting their nests is forbidden.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish representative at Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we don’t know how well their species are going,
Ronaldo denied rape charges when lawyers prepare a legal case against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called charges against him for rape “flag reports — saying people want to“ draw attention to themselves ” by using his name.
His lawyers intend to prosecute the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the accusations.
The front line for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He's said he paid her $375,000 left for the incident, according to Der Spiegel's report Friday.
A few hours after the charges were published, Ronaldo, 33, said in Instagram Live’s video to 142 million of his followers that they were “bad news —
No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today is false news, ” said the world champion five times to the camera.
“ These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man, and everything is fine, “added the player to the smiling.
Lawyer Ronaldos prepares to prosecute Der Spiegel for the accusations they have called “unacceptable disclosure of personal suspicions, ” according to Reuter’s news office.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that Ronaldo would demand compensation for “a wound of the same amount as the severity of the fracture, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years ”
The supposed incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he was supposed to have raped her in the rectum, according to documents submitted for Clark County County in Nevada.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the very bad incident and told her that he was “99 percent good man — who fell into temptation because of the “1 percent”
The documents argue that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex but that both of them had consented.
Mayorga claims that she went to the police and had her injuries taken pictures at the hospital, but finally agreed outside of the court, for she was “fearing of retaliation — and was concerned about becoming“ publicly deported ”
Now she says she wants to give up the peace because she's still in shock after a supposed incident.
Ronaldo was close to going to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the rape, and this summer he went over to the Italian giant Juve with a 100 million euro deal.
Brexit: Britain would “look for it forever — to lose car manufacturers
“ Britain would regret it forever — if it lost its position as an international leader among car manufacturers by Brexit, ” says Secretary of Business Greg Clark.
He added that it was “anxiety — that the Topotecan UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a contract, the company would temporarily stop manufacturing in its Burnaston factory, near Derby.
\"We need a deal,\" said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects from delays at the border if Brexit without a contract would be a reality, would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures the Tooyta Auris and the Avensis vehicles, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were transported to other European Union countries.
“My opinion is that if Britain gets out of the EU by the end of March, we will see the manufacturing sites in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyata, Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concerns about exit from the EU without agreeing on the way in which international trade should take place, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that it will close its Mini Factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns lie with what car manufacturers claim to be a chain risk if Brexit becomes a reality without a contract.
Toyata’s manufacturing line is based on reception at “the last hour” where parts are delivered every 37 minutes from both UK and EU supplies for cars produced after ordering.
If the UK reduces the EU without a contract on 29 March, there could be a disturbance at the border which the industry thinks may lead to delay and a lack of funds.
It would be impossible for Toyata to store more than a day’s supply in its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and therefore production would stop.
Mr Clark said that the Chequers programme Theresa May for a future relationship with the EU was aimed specifically at preventing these opinions at the borderline,
“We need a contract, we want to get the best deal that will enable us to enjoy not only success in the modern world, but as an opportunity that we can make use of, ” he said on radio programs at BBC Radio 4.
“ The evidence, not just from Topotecan, but from other manufacturers, shows that we must be able to continue with very effective approaches.
Toyata could not tell how long their production would last, but it warned that, for a longer period of time, increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years, said that his colleagues are increasingly concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs go away, they never come back.
The government spokesman said: “We have submitted a detailed and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU —
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein may be postponed again, according to the White House.
The White House, on Sunday, declared that an important meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein, a supporter of the State, could be “returned in one week — now the dispute between Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court judge’s committee, continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Muellers, a special prosecutor who investigates Russian campaign in elections, links between the assistants of Trump and Russia, and possible obstacles to the progress of justice by the President.
For weeks, rumors have been going to Washington about whether Trump is running an assistant state prosecutor and thus endangering Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times said that Rosenstein had talked about carrying a recording device to record a conversation with Trump and the possibility of turning the president over by using the 25th paragraph of the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
But on his last Monday, he visited the White House, including news that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump on Thursday, then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said — preferably not — he wants Rosenstein to be run, but then he was postponed to not being at the same time as an audience with the Senate Court Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who harassed him for sexual harassment, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly study by the FBI on charges against Kavanaugh, which delayed the vote of the Senate.
Sarah Sander, the media representative of Trump, was on the Fox News Sunday program.
When asked into the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “There has not been a date for him, it could be this week, and I consider it possible that he will be postponed by the second week because of everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we see, and I’m always happy to inform the media —
Some reporters disagree: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The president, Chris Wallace, asked about it.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not dissatisfied with the fact that TV reporters had “showy, ” but she said:“ I don’t disagree with the fact that they have visualism —
It then gave evidence that a direct connection between Trump and the media would increase.
“ The president answers more questions to the media than any president has ever done before, ” she said, without referring to the sources: “We have reviewed these figures —
Press conferences will still be held, said Sanders, but “if the press has a chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it’s far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of that and you've seen us do a lot of that over the past few weeks, and it's going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States --
Trump regularly answers questions as he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or media meetings with other leaders who visit him.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
The president may have shown that reason in New York this week, when he showed himself without restraint and during times of strange behavior in front of a group of reporters.
Minister for Health writes to EU health care professionals in Scotland because of concern for Brexit
The Minister for Health has written from the EU staff working in the health system in Scotland (NHS Scotland) to express the gratitude of the nation and wish that it would continue to work after Brexit has passed through.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months until the EU expires.
The Scottish Government has already promised to meet the costs of work permit applications for EU citizens working in the public service sector.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “In the summer of the year, due to the conclusions, discussions between Britain and the EU continue to be held and decisions are expected to be taken in the autumn.
The British Government has also worked to prepare if the agreement is not possible.
I know this must be a lot of uncertainty for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to say again how much I appreciate the work of the entire staff, regardless of their nationality.
EU and international partners provide valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the health services and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home, and we really want you to stay here,
Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a tenurer for Tennessee State Tigers, had to undergo an emergency surgery after having had a head injury of 31-27 loss against the team Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to Mike Organ report, the newspaperman Tennessee.
Rod Reed, chief of the Tennessee State, told the reporters that the injury had occurred shortly before halftime.
“ He came to the sideline and fell down there, ” said Reed.
Coaches and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before he was placed on a stretcher and carried out for further examination.
A police officer from Tennessee State told Chris Harris, director of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had had an operation at the Vanderbilt hospital.
Harris added that there was “no information on the type or severity of the impact yet — and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, who is in her final year at school, plays his first period with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five grand totals on Saturday before he went out of it, which raised the total number of these in him up to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp charges when buying real estate in Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp charges when buying real estate in the UK.
The operation will make Corby's campaign a success to attract young voters
Increased stamp charges will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in Britain
Government funds estimate 120 million pounds a year - to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp charges when they buy real estate in the UK, and the overfund will be used to help the homeless. Theresa May will announce this today.
The operation will be considered an attempt to undo the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign in attracting young voters by promising housing on a more accessible price and taxing the people of high incomes.
Individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK need to pay higher stamp rates, and the overcompensation will take place in the government to assist the homeless.
The increase - which is in addition to current stamp charges, including the increase that was put on two years ago in an extra home and real estate purchase for rent - could be up to three percent.
A government fund estimates that the increase will make up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new buildings in London are purchased from foreign residents, which results in price increases and makes it easier for those who want to buy real estate for the first time to enter the market.
Many of the richest regions in the country — especially in the capital city — have become “sacrifice towns — because of the number of foreign merchants who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp charges to help other young people have their first home.
He accused a large construction company of keeping property prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged May to cancel the mortgages on the premises that would be available to fix “household houses — Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of reliable house-to-house renovations, including rent audit and the end of rentals without cause.
He also wants to give more power to build a new home.
Theresa May said: “In the first place, I said that I would devote myself to the restoration of the British dream during my first period — that every new generation should enjoy a better quality of life.
And that means making up our new real estate market.
The doors of Britain will always open up to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it may not be true that it is as easy for a foreigner to buy a home as for a hardworking British citizen as a business with a foreign headquarters.
For many, the dream of their own home has become far too distant, and the shame of homelessness is still too real —
Jack Ross: “My main goal is to train Scotland.
Jack Ross, Sunderland’s trainer, says that it is his “premium goal — to become Scotland’s trainer at some point.
This 42-year-old Scoot now enjoys the challenge of blowing new life into the North-East Club, now in third place in the first division, three points from the top.
He moved to Sunderland in the summer after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Selection Department in the last season.
“ I wanted to play for my people as a player.
I was injured on my knee, so I was finished, ” said Ross in an interview with Sports Sound at BBC Scotland.
“ But I grew up watching Scotland often in Hampden with my father, as a child, and there’s always something that has pulled me back.
But that opportunity would only be available if I were to train a branch team well —
The former Ross who coaches Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of the Alloa Athletic Club said that he felt no fear of following in the footsteps of such famous names of such a large club, but he had previously rejected training positions at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“ As I am, I’ll measure my success by thinking: “I can get this club back into the top-level department —
This club definitely has its home in the selection department because of its structure and situation, ” he said.
“It’s not easy to get him there, but I would probably only consider myself successful here if I get the club back up there —
Ross has only three years of training experience, after a period of assistant coaching at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of the training course for Hearts.
He helped Alloa to recover from falling into the third division, and he changed St Mirren, who was about to fall through the division, to the branch master the next season.
Ross claims to be safer now, but he was ever in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkik, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
“ It was probably a real time, ” he says, “when he became an Alloa trainer.
“ I really believed that my training was suitable for me, even more than playing.
It sounds strange, for I was doing well, I had decent profits from it, and enjoyed a more reasonable success.
But changes can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot every week.
I still go through the stress and pressure of the job, but the training work seems just right for me.
I always wanted to train, and now I do, I've never felt better about myself in all my adult years —

The best time for beer is at 5:30 on Saturdays, according to a poll
In the summer, the fever has proved to be profitable for a British bar that has a problem, but it has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants, the number decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, from the business adviser CGA, who compiled the figures, said: “The continuing sunshine and unexpected success of England in the World Cup meant that July followed similar patterns to the June month, when the barrage increased by 2.8 percent, except what restaurants sold even less.
The sale fell by 1.8 percent at restaurants in June and got worse again in July.
The main aim of drinking sales was for the most part the mobs and bars with more upturn while restaurants went downhill.
Food - selling mobs also struggled in the sun, but not as much as a restaurant.
Looks like people just wanted to go out drinking.
Drinks sold in pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent over the month, but food stores decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman, from RSM, said: “These results continue the swing we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social events or sports events are still the largest factors in sales in non-resident markets.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups still face difficulties, although sales reductions of 4.8 percent between months are particularly painful above continued cost - related pressures.
This long and hot summer could hardly come at a worse time for restaurants, and only time will show whether the temperate temperature, as we have had in August, will improve the situation --
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including those in newly opened locations, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slow pace of openings.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the surveillance company with the British pub bar and restaurant company, gathers and records from 47 operating groups, summarising a total of £9 billion and being the industrial focus of the sector.
One in five children has a secret account on community media that they hide from their parents
One in five children, down to 11 years of age, has classified accounts on social media that they cover for their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 students showed an increase in “Insta” pages
The news has added concern about the publication of sexual material
Twenty percent of students claim to have “the primary account they show parents
One in five children, down to 11 years of age, make secret accounts on social media that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students showed a large increase in “the Insta account ” — a reference to the Instagram Web site.
The news has added concern about the publication of sexual material.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean, clean, “old account to show parents, as well as keeping secret accounts.
One mother, who fell down on her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret Web site, found a youth who encouraged others to “rape me ”
The study by Digital Awareness UK and a private school director (HMC) showed that 40 percent of children aged 11-18 had two accounts, and half of them admitted to keeping secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: “It’s a matter of concern that so many youths are tempted to create online territory where parents and teachers cannot find them —
Eilidh Doyle will be a “sport of athletes ” at the Scottish Athletics Sports Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected by the Scottish Athletics Committee as head of the annual General Meeting of the Government without any authority.
Doyle is the most successful sportswoman in Scotland and Ian Beattie, chairman of the committee, who said that the appointment was an excellent opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience in the past decade.
“ Elidh enjoys great respect in sports communities in Scotland, Britain, and international, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would make a lot of money getting it in the committee, ” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am very interested in speaking on behalf of athletes and hope that I can do my part and help to carry on in Scotland —

He wrote on Twitter: “For one month, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.

It’s been hard work, but I usually got to go back and do sports practice today!

Breast pump agly, which compares mothers to cows, causes problems on the Internet
An enterprise producing a breast pump is now reported on the Internet due to advertisements that carry milking mothers with milked cows.
The company Elvie publishes a sharp advertisement to mark what is said to be “the first silent breast pumps on the outside of the world — the advertisement is inspired by music videos and should demonstrate the freedom the new pump gives mothers who are breast - feeding.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cuddle along with lyrics such as: “Yes, I have milked myself, but you cannot see my tail — and if you did not notice, it is not a wee but a breast of me —
The attachment continues: “Pump, pump, feed the children, pump, pump, I pump milk from the jugs ”
However, the advertisement, which appears on the Facebook website of the company, has been the subject of a review on the Internet.
The video has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and has had a variety of reactions from the audience, many of whom say that it boasts “the horror — that follows the milk industry.
“ It’s a bad decision to use cows to advertise these products.
Just as we do, they need to become calf - fed and produce milk, except for what the calves are taken from them only a few days after they are born, “said in one of the talks.
Elvie’s breast pump fits comfortably into the breast-feeding container (Elvie/Mother)
Another observer wrote: “Unquestionably difficult for both mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children —
Another added: “This advertisement is completely out of date with time —
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she was “very funny —
“ I think it’s a great idea.
I'd have bought one of these if I still had a baby.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping milk.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
It's a genius, wrote one of the spectators.
Another said: “It’s a fun advertisement directed at mothers who pump milk (often at workplaces or in the toilet) and feel like “cushion”
This is not a commercial that commends or judges the milk industry —
At the end of the ad, the women’s group shows that they were all dancing with their breast pumps hidden in their breastplates.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women say that they feel like cows when pumping milk.
However, the Elvie pump is quite silent, has no wires or wires, and fits comfortably into the breastplate, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their child, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, the co - officer and head of Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is so revolutionary that it understood a prominent presentation that would give rise to discussion.
By comparing women to cows, we wanted to direct the flashlight to breast pumping and all its challenges, even showing in a fun and familiar way how much freedom the new pump would give.
This isn't the first time Elvie pump has gotten on the news.
At the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared at a fashion show for designer Marta Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrants quietly moved to camp at the Texas border
The number of prisoners in custody has suddenly increased, even though the number of people crossing the border monthly has remained somewhat the same, part of which is that hard words and policies presented by the government of Trump have made it more difficult for the children to have a temporary baby.
In general, the foster parents have been unregistered immigrants themselves, and they have been afraid to put their chances of remaining in danger in the country by volunteering to raise a child.
The risk was increased in June, when the government announced that potential foster parents and other adults within the home would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration check.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the head of the immigration and customs authorities, witnessed before the Senate and said that his institution had arrested a number of people who applied for the birth of single children.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not on a criminal record.
“ Nearly 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or in children’s foster homes are illegal, and much of them are illegal immigrants on a criminal record.
“ Therefore, ” said Mr. Albence, “we keep looking for them.
In an effort to speed up the process, representatives announced new rules requiring some of the children to appear in court within a month of being held in custody, rather than after 60 days of the first set of standards, according to a staff working in the scene.
Many of them will meet through a video conference, rather than in their own person, to justify their legal standing before a judge in immigration matters.
Children who are judged unfit for entry are sent out of the country quickly.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent or refugee attempts, according to the recruiters and reports published by the system in recent months.
Talkers said that these problems are even more likely in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where no one is likely to notice a child’s difficulty because of their number.
They added that the transfer of children to the tent city without giving enough time to prepare them spiritually or to say goodbye to friends could add to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria says “armament team — France, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
Walid al-Moualem, Foreign Minister, also said in his speech to the United States General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even if the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays the role of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign troops were illegal in Syria, under the false assumption that they fought terrorism, and that “they will be treated accordingly,”
“ They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions, ” he said to the council.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terrorism was almost over — in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to flee their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue “to wage this holy fight until we clear all the Syrian regions — both of terrorist groups and of“ all the illegal foreign people —
The United States has about 2,000 Syrian soldiers, with most of them training and counseling both Kurdish and Syrian Arrabs fighting against President Bashar Al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war - torn country.
As for refugees, Moualem said that circumstances would be good enough for them to return, teaching “some western lands — to“ spread out fear without cause — which encouraged refugees to stay away.
“ We have called on international society and a humanitarian organization to facilitate their return, ” he said.
“ They make politics out of something that should be purely humanitarian —
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funding for reconstruction in Syria unless a political agreement exists between Assad and the Resistance to end the war.
According to the U.S., a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a neutral area for the last major opposition campaign has created an opportunity to continue political dialogue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a massive attack by Syrian troops, supported by Russia, in the province of three million people.
Moualem, on the other hand, stressed that the agreement had “exactly been concluded” and expressed the hope that military action would be directed at Jihadites, including Nusra Front fighters, who are linked to Al-Qaeda, and that they“ were destroyed”
Staffan de Mistura, Ambassador of the United Nations, hopes to be able to come to the first meetings with a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition, to prepare a Constitution for Syria after the war and to pay the street for the election.
Moualem provided conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, and said that its work should be limited to “passing over the provisions of the current government, ” and warned against all interventions.
Reasons that Trump will win another election period
According to that argument, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 elections, except that the charges and scandals put an end to his presidential career, as many liberal viewers are likely hoping for.
In what would no doubt “the most dramatic end of the presidential career ever...
As you can see, there are no signs of fatigue on the audience.
Since 2014, the outlook at the best time has more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN, and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million audiences at its best, which is an increase from 1.7 million spectators four years ago, according to Nielsen, and a MSNBC feature, “The Rachel Maddow Show, ” has peaked with up to 3.5 million audiences on important news evenings.
“ This is a fire that people are attracted to, because this is something we don’t understand, ” said Neal Baer, a member of the ABC dramatist “Designed Survivor — a member of the government who will be president after the Senate is completely destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Fear Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys - Club, has another idea.
She remembers a ride to a taxi in Boston before the elections in 2016.
The cab driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked.
He said, “Because he makes me laugh, Miss Scovell said to me.
There's an entertainment value in the mess.
Unlike TV, however, Washington’s stories could determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether the families of immigrants can unite and the health of the international community.
Only those who enjoy the greatest privilege can afford to stop watching.
And yet, this is more than being an informed citizen when you look at the group of experts ’ reasonings using Bob Woodwards on “afar close - minded ” sources for your book“Fear, ” or $15,000 jackets from ostriches worn by Paul Manafort (“a bunch born with pride, ” said the Washington Post) and the consequences of the exact biological descriptions of Mr. Trump.
At least I will never see Super Mario the same eyes again.
“That part of what he does seems to be a reality factor is that he gives something to you every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the “Pawn Stars” factors, discussing the employee foundation in Trump’s exhibition, and daily changes in the narrative (e.g. starting a fight with N.F.L. and complimenting Kim Jong-Un).

Extra money in the narrowest elections of the mid - period
It is not surprising that the 17th region of Pennsylvania sees the money flow to it, thanks to reorganization in elected areas, which led to two representatives competing for the same seat.
The newly reorganized Pittsburgh region sends out Democratic Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a different zone in special elections last summer.
Lamb offers himself to another representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now representing the old 12th voting area of Pennsylvania, a new 17th district.
The map of the voting areas was reorganized after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old voting areas were organized in the interests of the Republicans and that they were in violation of the Constitution.
The new 17th Electoral Zone has been launched to compete in the funding of campaign campaign between the major funders of both categories, the DCC and the NRCC.
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the special elections in March before the 18th district of Pennsylvania, but many followed that election.
The Republicans had previously made it a seat in more than a decade, and President Donald Trump, he won a 20 - point zone.
Political experts have given a little advance to democrats.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then stopped.
Government officials noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already acknowledged Beijing, with small objections from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, president of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the owners of the Trump Management Team ran away.
The representatives of the State Department decided to recall the U.S. ambassador of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama for “new decisions not to accept Taiwan anymore, ” said Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice in early this month.
However, punishment was only considered against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $ 140 million from the United States for relief work in 2017, including drug control, development work, and economic support.
The penalties imposed and included the reduction of financial support and the limitation of residence permits would have been painful for the Central American country, where unemployment and mortality rates are high.
As internal meetings continued, American and Central American representatives postponed the Conference on Security and Economic Success and were to follow a similar meeting held last year, which was considered to be a step forward in efforts to prevent people from moving to the United States.
However, in mid - September, senior officials made it clear that they wanted the convention to take place and thus ended all the misdemeanors of punishment against El Salvador.
The vice president, Mike Pence, is now to address the conference, which will take place in mid - October, as a sign of its importance in the eyes of the government, said the ambassadors.
The three U.S. envoys also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new hard message or punishment from Washington.
Mr Bolton’s White House spokesman refused to discuss further the discussions described by the three U.S. representatives, including two ambassadors, who agreed to discuss the domestic talks against being anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outsider who works closely with the government and also spoke of the matter against anonymity.
Learn From History
The next scandal may be Robert Mueller's special prosecutor's report on the possible actions by Mr Trump to prevent justice, but for that accusation there is many official evidence.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller will turn his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign was working with Russia in its attack on our election.
If the Congress is governed by another class, Trump may have to bear responsibility for it, in the mouth he prepares to meet his electors again, and perhaps his leftovers.
However, this is extremely uncertain and I do not wish to suggest that the fall of Mr Trumps is clear, nor the fall of his colleague in Europe.
We all have to choose, both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the battle will be.
In 1938, German rulers were ready to rob Hitler, only if Western countries had given him opposition and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of disaster that followed.
History revolves around such important points and speeds up or slows down the unstoppable progress of democracy.
The United States faces some such important period now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump is running Mr. Rod Rosenstein's Public Prosecutor, the man in charge of the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this magazine reported that last year he had suggested making secret recordings of the president and discussing whether he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times story is wrong.
“ How will we react if the recent investigation by the FBI at Brett Kavanaugh is not detailed or reasonable, or if it is confirmed in the seat of a Supreme Court judge despite religious accusations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote for a congress during the mid-term that will hold Mr. Trump axle responsible?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have to endure long winters.
But I don't think we're going to fall because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia and was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government and was previously in my ambassador’s quarters.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later, she sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with her swastika.
With such an inheritance, how can I but look intently at our future?

Graham Dorrans, Rangers officer, optimistic for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory against the Austrians will put them in a strong position to get out of the G-group of the European Union. Rangers made a magnificent draw in Spain against Villaarreal earlier this month.
An injury on the knee prevented the middleman Graham Dorrans from playing his first game in the season until in the game against the Wild Land ending with a 2-2 draw, but he believes that Rangers can use the scores as a jumper for better results.
“ It was good to get this point for us, for Vilarreal is a strong team, ” said Dorrans, 31.
“ We began with the belief that we could achieve something and end up taking one step.
Perhaps we could have claimed victory at the end, but in general, a fair outcome was likely equal.
They were probably better in the first half of the game, and we got strong into the second half and played better.
Thursday is another important night for the European Department.
I hope we can get to three points, but it's gonna be a tough game because they went well at their last game, but with the audience who supports us, I'm sure we're going through this and we're getting a positive result.
The last year was difficult, both because of the less damage and the changes that occurred in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling at the scene.
The team is good and the boys enjoy themselves. The training is good.
Hopefully, we can move forward now, put the last season behind us, and achieve success —
Women lose their sleep because of fear of losing their pension savings
Although participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few would discuss this with their family members.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide Survey said that they discussed the cost of long - term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent claimed to discuss this with their children.
“People want family members to take it, but they do not take the right steps to have that conversation, ” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Security Department.
That's the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for them if you do not give them good warning about your wishes.
Talk to your counselor and your family about where and when you will receive care, as these options can greatly change your cost.
Include your financial adviser: Your counselor may also help you to find a way to pay for this expense.
Among the choices you have to pay for long-term care are standard life insurance with long-term insurance, mixed life insurance that pays out cash, to help pay the costs, or self-assurance with your own money - as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: Prevent legal conflict in advance
Ask your healthcare professional for advice so that you can name someone you trust to supervise your healthcare professional care and ensure that your healthcare professionals do so if you cannot express them directly on your own.
Consider, too, the use of procureans for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your accounts are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your aged father or mother is in an emergency and is going to a hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please give these details exactly in a written schedule so that you are ready.

Earthquakes and Floods in Indonesia
At least 384 people died after a powerful earthquake and a tide in the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, said representatives, and it is expected that the number of dead will rise.
Since all communications lie low, relief workers have been unable to provide any information from the Danube County, which is located near the center of the earthquake, 7.5 in Richter.
More than 16,000 people were left their homes in Pala after calamity struck.
Here are some key facts about Pala and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, located at the bottom of a narrow flood on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The estimated number of inhabitants was 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th birthday when the earthquake and the flood occurred.
Donggala is a county that covers more than 200 miles [380 km] of a coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, a district management area, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sectors of activity in the Central Sulawesi region, especially in the Donggala coast area.
Nickel studies are also important in the province, but most of them are in the Morowali, which is on the beach in the face of Sulawesi.
The flood waves have clashed over Pala and Donggala several times over the past century, according to the Indonesian disaster organization.
In 1938, over 200 people died when a flood, and hundreds of houses in Donggala were destroyed.
A flood will also be in the western part of Dongala in 1996, where nine died.
Indonesia sits on the active cycle of the Pacific, where earthquakes are regular.
Here are the major earthquakes and tidal waves last year:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh region in the northern part of the Shumatra over the 26th of December set in motion a tidal wave, which took place in 14 countries and killed 226 000 people across the Indian coast, of which more than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: The row of strong tremors crossed the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds die on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Earthquake on 6.8, Richter rode the southern part of Jöva, the largest island in Indonesia, and caused a flood that struck on the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A earthquake of 7.6, on Richter, overthrew near Padang, a capital city in the western part of Shumatra.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: A earthquake of 7.5 on Richter over one of the Mentawai Island near Sumatatra and raised up to 10 meters [10 m] high flood waves that destroyed numerous villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake raged over the Pie Jaya County in Aceh, causing destruction and overeating as people remembered the destruction of the deadly earthquake and flood wave in 2004.
No floods developed this time, but more than 100 were killed in the collapse of buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes ride over the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, and over 500 people died, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped on the island.
Sarah Palin’s oldest son, accused of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and president of the U.S.A., has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29 years old and from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, for trying to prevent a report of domestic violence, and for resisting arrests, according to a report by the Alaskan Police Department, published on Saturday.
According to a police report, Palin took the phone off her friend when she tried to call the police to report a suspected crime.
Palin is held in the Mat-Su Station where he awaits the audience before the court, and he is held against the 500-dollar guarantee, according to KTUU's news.
He was judged on Saturday, declaring that he was “not guilty, definitely — when he was asked to declare guilt or innocence, according to the news station.
Palin is charged with three crimes in category A, which means that he could be sentenced to prison for up to one year and had to pay $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with crimes in category B, which is punishable by one day in prison and $2,000 in guilt.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin called the police to announce the intentional attack.
The case is now being dealt with for the surrender court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, for preventing the announcement of domestic violence, and for carrying weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend has claimed that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of surrenderers in 2016 after she taught a shock disorder about her son’s violent behavior, after his military service in Iraq.
An Earthquake and A Flood in Indonesia: Hundreds Dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake, 7.5 at Richter, triggered a flood wave and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication systems are down, and the number of dead is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake occurred right in the middle of the island of Sulawesi, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
A video that shows when the incident took place in the social media.
A hundred people had gathered at the coastal festival in Pala when the flood fell on the beach.
Appeals for rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attacker in New York City
New York’s prosecutors want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of having participated in a terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for violation of federal law since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is thought to have taken a Home Depot truck on the hire to attack people on a bicycle path along the street West Side Highway in the lower Manhattan. He drove down there walking and riding by road in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the victims eight “accidentally — causing serious physical injury — according to the willful declaration of the death penalty recorded in the Southern province of New York.
Both of these charges may lead to the possible death penalty, according to the court.
Many weeks after the attack, Saipov, a 22 - generation federal court, accused eight of murder charges for criminal purposes, generally committed by prosecutors in prosecutions against organized crime organisations, was charged with violent crime and the destruction of the vehicle.
The attack included “a somewhat planned plan, ” said the accusers, describing Sapiov’s actions as“ cruel, cruel, and immoral —
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov became a victim of physical injury, harm and loss for families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” says the Will Declaration.
Five victims were travelers from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the southern region of New York City was the last capital punishment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in a court case in New York City in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were killed after being convicted of spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both couples were put to death in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no evidence of the repentance of the days and months after the attack, according to court record.
He told a detective that he was doing well with what he had done, told the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been given the idea of the attack after watching videos from his ISIS on the phone, as stated in the charges.
Also, he asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, said the police.
He has declared his innocence on all 22 sides of the charge.
David Patton, one of the public defenders of Saipov, said that they were “knowingly disappointed — by the decision of the prosecution.
“ We believe that the decision to ask for a death penalty rather than agreeing to a life-incarceration declaration without the possibility of a life-incarceration will only prolong the shock due to this event to all parties, ” said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek the death penalty.
A member of the team says that NIGEL FARAGE should conduct negotiations for Brexit.
Nigel Farage promised to “act the army of the people — today in protest at the Conservatives ’ Conference.
This former leader of the Ukip said that politicians must “feel the pressure — from doubters about the EU, at the same time as one of Theresa May’s congresses suggested that he conduct the negotiations with the EU.
Maintainer Peter Bone said to Birmingham’s protestant that Britain “will be out — now if Mr. Farage was the leader of Brexit.
However, the challenge faced by May to settle a deep dispute between her own teammen was even more evident when maintenanceists who want to remain in the EU participated in other protests against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister finds it difficult to keep the Chequers' programme in the right place and is under criticism from those who are in favour of Brexit, who are opposed, and the EU.
The Allies claimed that she will continue to struggle to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the opposition and force those who are opposed to Brexit and the Workers’ Party to choose between her plan and “uneasy”
Mr. Bone said to the Leave Means Leavee protesting in Solihull that he wanted to “lost at the Chequers program —
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been allowed to take part and assume responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“ If he was in control, we would be out now, ” he said.
The Senator from Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit but we must get rid of the Chequers program —
He explained his opposition to the EU and said: “We did not fight in world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own law in our own country —
Mr. Bone pointed out that the opinion of the public had changed from the elections in 2016: “The idea that the British public changed their minds and wants to stay is absolutely untrue —
Andrea Jenky, a persistent supporter of Brexit, was also on the protest march and said to reporters: “I simply want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers program is unfriendly among the public, and opposition will not vote for it; it will benefit the enemy among our social groups and activists who are on the streets and vote for us.
Please stop Chequers's program and start listening
In direct messages to May, she added: “The prime ministers keep the job when they fulfill their promises —
Mr. Farage said that the politicians would have to “feel under pressure — if they were going to let go of the decision that was taken following the vote in 2016.
“ This is now about confidence between our people and our political party, ” he said.
“They want to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to say to them — we won’t let you get away with this —
He added in his messages to the crowd: “I want you to let the pressure of your political party, which is cheating on Brexit.
We the army of the common people in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we have become independent, self-reserving, proud Great Britain -
At the same time, EU supporters held a protest march in Birmingham, which ended with a two-hour protest conference in the central city.
After the group was set up this weekend, a small group of activists waved flags against Brexit.
Lord Adonis, a Worker’s team, made fun of maintainers because of safety problems encountered in the telephone program when the convention was opened.
“ These are the people who tell us that they can have all the computer systems in order and all the technology for Canada plus, for without barriers, for free business with Ireland without borders, ” he added.
- It's a complete scandal.
“ There is no such thing as good Brexit, ” he said.
Warren is “thinking seriously... to volunteer for the presidency. ”
Elizabeth Warren, U.S. Senator of the U.S.
According to a report from Boston Globe, Massachusetts’s Democratic Party discussed its future at a convention in the west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has rarely criticized the President of the United States of America, proposes to vote again in November against the Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-ordinator in the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the center of dissatisfaction that she could offer herself against Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke this afternoon on Saturday was a 36th meeting in the form of city fans with residents in her choice, since Trump took office.
One of the delegates in the meeting asked her if she was planning on volunteering for president.

The Baton Rouge police reported a arrest at Dyteon Simpson, 20 at a press conference at 11:00 in the morning.
She had previously published a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was seen on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near Southern University University in early Friday.
“ Wayde Sims had a bullet wound in his head and died of it, ” said Marshal Murphy J. Paul, at the media on Saturday, according to a report from 247sport.

Grand Prix, Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after Sebastian Vettel gives him the seat of victory by order of their team.
It was obvious from the moment Valteri Bottas reached a seat in front of Lewis Hamilton at the start-up on Saturday, that orders from Mercedes would play a big party in the competition.
Bottas got a good start in starting and left Hamilton almost as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to fight against his teammates.
Vetel went first to the pit and had Hamilton drive into the traffic at the end of the group, which should have been the key.
The Mercedes car went into the pit one cycle later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton came across a short battle where a Ferrari driver was forced to leave the inner gates after he had been at risk of being left, after the defence attempt in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started in the back of the group and was in seventh place at the end of his first cycle, on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the competition as he delayed changing tyres to try to finish quickly and get past the Kimi Raikon and reach the fourth seat.
He eventually went into the pit in a 44th circle but could not increase the speed of the eight remaining rings, and Raikon took his fourth seat.
This is a difficult day because Valteri was doing great all weekend and was a real gentleman to let me out.
The team has done great things to achieve this success, ” said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein on a Saturday meeting, because of her claim that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court judge, of sexual harassment.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but did not directly discuss the testimony of Ford before the Senate decision board, saying that what went on in the Senate showed that people were “bad and cruel and unspeakable”
“ The only things that could happen and the wonderful things that have been going on in the last days in the elders ’ department, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and cruel and untrue, ” he said.
“ When you see the lights and leaks and then say them “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't--
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you do this?
Do you remember her answer... do you miss the document - \"Oh, ha, what?
Oh, no.
I won't let it go.
Wait a minute.
No, we did not sink it, “speak to him, and imitate the senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where the charges made by Ford against Kavanaugh were leaked early in September, and Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
“ I didn’t hide the accusations of Dr. Ford, I didn’t finish her story, ” said Feinstein to the committee, according to a report from The Hill.
“ She asked me to keep it confidential, and I did what she asked me to do —
But her denial did not seem to go well with the president, who said at the Saturday meeting: “I tell you, it was really bad exercise.
Maybe she won't let go, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen --
The president continued his defense for Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women, and urged the Democratics to take advantage of their accusations.
“ They are determined to regain power, no matter what it takes.
You see the brutality, the evil, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to choose to gain power and control, “said the president, according to a report from Mediaite.

Air traffic controller leaves life to ensure that hundreds of passengers in a plane escape an earthquake
A flight director in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a great earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and launched a flash wave.
Large earthquakes continue to plague the area, and many are trapped under the ruins of the city of Pala.
Twenty - one - year - old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, despite the fact that his associates had fled the tower that was violently swinging at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Pala.
He stayed to ensure that the Batik Air Number 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake was on its way, could no doubt be able to air.
He then jumped out of the tower when he thought he was falling apart.
He later died in a hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, Air Navigation Indonesia’s spokesman, said that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to a report from ABC News, Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
“ We are very sad to hear, ” he added.
The authorities fear that the number of the dead could exceed a thousand, according to the country’s disaster facility, that access is restricted to the towns of Dongala, Sigi, and Boutong.
“ It is said that many dead people are still rising because many bodies are still under ruins and cannot be reached, ” said Sutpo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Institute.
Up to a hundred feet [6 m] tall have caused enormous destruction in Pala, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
The army and passenger planes are working to provide relief supplies and supplies.
In an interview with Sky News, 35 - year - old Risa Kusuma said: “In every minute an ambulance comes with a body.
There's no such thing as clean water.
The small markets have been robbed everywhere —
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said in an interview with CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross competes with finding survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it might get worse.
Joko Widododo, President of Indonesia, came to Pala on Sunday and said to the country’s army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all missions related to the evacuation.
Are you ready — said on a news report from CNN.
Earlier this year, earthquakes hit Lombok, Indonesia, where more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a plane is also missing after it crashed into Lon
The airline, with a plane that crashed into a lion in Micronesia, now says that one person is missing, after having previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini announced that from the afternoon of Saturday, it did not know about the departure of one male passenger.
The airline claimed to work with the local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, agents said that seven people were transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers are still in a hospital on Saturday and that their condition is stable.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and what the precise sequence of events was.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said that the plane had landed just before the runway.
Some people thought that the plane had crossed the runway too far.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane had been very low.
\"It was really good,\" said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others could run deep into the water and reach emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the pilots had been frightened and shouted and that he had suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that seamen who were working only a few minutes to make up a dock also helped to save their lives by using a bloated boat to transport people to land before the plane sank to about 30 meters [30 m] of deep water.
Data from the Air Safety Agency show that 111 people have died in the aircraft accidents of PNG registered aircraft for the past two decades, none of which were connected to Air Niugini.
An expert describes the timeline of the evening that a woman was burned alive
The prosecutors closed their case on Saturday in a reopening case against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert from the U.S. Department of Justice, was in court for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to his belly how he used cell phone records to puzzle together the journeys of the accused, 29 - year - old Quinton Tellis, and the 19 - year - old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said that he had received a number of cell phones showing that Tellis had the Chambers evening she died, on the contrary to his earlier statements, according to a report from The Clarion Ledger.
When evidence showed that his cell phone was with Chamber at the same time as he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, a police officer went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said that he had not been in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said it was \"a lie, because my car was in Nashville\"
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Mobile phone records showed that they had only been known for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chamber's death, Tellis had deleted text messages, phone calls, and her contact details from his phone.
“ He destroyed her from his life, ” said Hale.
Guards are expected to deliver their final talk on Sunday.
The judge said that it would be expected that the matter will be brought before the abdomen later that day.

Another black person?
New York’s foster of a couple’s lawyers for exorcism after a “denial — textual message ”
In New York City, a wife who was a lawyer because of illegal disfellowshipping after she received a surprise text message from her mother, complaining that she was “another black person —
The couple, therefore, refuse to be prejudiced and liken the prosecution to “deprived ”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed discontent when she learned that her new foster, Giselle Maurice, would be black when she came to work for the first time in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in text messages.
But instead of sending messages to her husband, she sent them twice to Miss Maurice.
After discovering their mistakes, Plasco-Flaxman, Ms. Maurice, reported that their former black fetus had done badly, and that she had expected to have a Filipino woman, according to New York Post.
Miss Maurice was paid for one of her work days and then sent home to Uber.
Maurice, a lawyer, now wants to be paid because of the eviction, that the amount of 350 dollars a day for the six - month job that she had originally obtained, although no contract was signed.

The couple have objected to the charges that they were prejudiced, saying that it was right to run Maurice, because they felt that they could not trust her after insulting her.

She's not prejudiced.
We are not prejudiced people, ” says the husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
“ But who would trust their children after showing such rudeness, even if this were a surprise?
His newborn baby?
Come on.
Plasco likened the prosecution to “depression, ” saying that his wife had arrived seven months away and was in“ difficult times hard to deal with —
“ Are you going to attack someone in this situation?
That’s not very nice of you, ” said Plasco, who works in the investment company.
The case is still in trial, but the public has taken hard words about the couple in the social media and has ashamed them of their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington’s publishers feared that readers would find it difficult to like a talking bear, says a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said of the letter: “It is difficult to put herself in the footsteps of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
“It’s very funny now that we know of the enormous success of Paddington’s
She said that her father, who worked as a member of the BBC before he was inspired to write a children’s book about a small toy bear, had rejected his works with calm positiveness, and added that the 60th birthday of the book was “a sweet year — after his death last year.
As to Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important family member, ” she added that her father had been silently proud of his success in the end.
“ He was very quiet, and not used to bragging, ” she said.
“ But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you had a baby that does something, and you’re proud of it even if you haven’t really done anything yourself.
I think he might have looked at Paddington's success in some way.
Although Paddington was creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington the credit,
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her through the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but without success.
“Nad called regularly and told me that the situation was extremely bad, that she was not expected to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Then Nad called me and said that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines given by the doctors to keep her heart rate up were gradually losing its activity and getting out of the body.
She had died shortly before, and that was her body giving up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all happening.
I could not cry or grievance, because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I had to control myself.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned her dead daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the difficulties she experienced.
\"No one knew anything,\" she said.
“ I would kill my head, and my tears would fall all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but during the flight, I felt great compassion for Nad.
That he would need my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her —
Grieving women hang messages to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who had a loved one who committed suicide are now trying to prevent others from taking life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted messages on a bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and telephone numbers that people can call for and receive help.
Tyler, a 13 - year - old son of Miss Davis, began to suffer from depression and committed suicide when he was 18.
“ I don’t want any parent to feel like I have to suffer every day, ” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, lives in Lydney, said that her son had been a successful cook with an infectious smile.
“ He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could light up any room --
He stopped working before he died, for he was “dried down to a very dark place ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, 11 years old, found his brother dead after taking his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that it’s going to be a result of it —
Miss Davis made the message “to let people know that they can go and talk to others, even friends.
Don't sit and say nothing - you need to talk to someone --
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Miss Davies for years, lost Mark, his spouse to 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“ He didn’t talk about his suffering or depression or anything like that, ” she said.
“ Some days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his temper.
He was at his worst on Christmas Day--when the children opened their gifts he didn't look in their eyes or anything--
She said that his death was a shock to them, but they had to work it out: “This tears a hole in the family.
It'll break us apart.
But we must go on and fight —

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on a blue thread that the FBI has investigated
“ I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for with a limited time and scope — maybe we could get a little along, ” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was “to split apart — in the middle of a conflict between the classes where everything was in a backlock.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their slowness is due to the timing.
The mid -term discussions are in just five weeks, November 6, and if the Republicans are in bad shape, as expected, they are weakening their serious efforts to get a man elected to sit in the Supreme Court of the land.
George W. Bush has been calling senators to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and met his wife, Ashley, through him, who was Mr. Bush' personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its research report?
A vote will be taken at the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democratics sit at the right time.
It is not yet certain whether Mr. Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, which would enable Mike Pence to break up the draw and confirm it in the court of the Supreme Court.
Number of those fleeing North Korea lower under Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a congressman from South Korea.
Park Byeong Saug, quoted data from the South Korea Cooperation Council, and said that 1127 people fled last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border alerts between North Korea and China and higher charges charged by smugglers with people were key factors.
Pyongyang has not published a public declaration.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea are invited to receive the right of citizens of South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people flee to China, which has the longest border to North Korea, and is easier to cross than the more neutral regions between North and South Korea.
China views refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often forces them to return to their homeland.
Cooperation between North and South Korea, which is still engaged in war technically, has improved considerably over the past month.
In the past few months, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for discussions that focused mainly on delayed negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This was after a historic meeting in June between President Donald Trump and Mr Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work together in the direction of nuclear-free Korea.
On Saturday, on the other hand, Mr Ri Yong Ho, the Secretary of State for North Korea, taught American business boards about the lack of progress since then.
“ Without confidence in the United States, no one is certain about the safety of our country, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to take down our nuclear weapons unilaterally first, ” said Ri in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York City.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “murder - sick — and says he is unable to perform the function of a Supreme Court judge
Nancy Pelosi, the head of the minority assembly, called Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court judge “murder - sick — and told him too temperate to be able to operate in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi interviewed those words on Saturday at the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
“ I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had ever acted like this, she would have been called maternally ill, ” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Branch Decision Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the charges that he had harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both young and young.
In his opening talk, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and at times he ran up close to shouting and had a cake in his throat when discussing his family and school years.
He also publicly condemned the DPRK in the committee and called the charges against him “a disgusting and organized murder — organized by liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton’s loss of the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi claimed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not work at the Supreme Court, for he showed that he was partial to the demódras.
“I think that these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democratics show that he is incompetent to the job, ” she said.
Pelosi did not respond when asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh fired from work if it is confirmed and if the Democratics get the majority of the assembly.
“ I’ll say this: if he isn’t telling the Congress or the FBI the truth, then he’s not only unfit to be in the Supreme Court but also in the court he’s now, ” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is now acting as a judge at the appeal court in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Kavanaugh against the Affridable Care Act or the abortion laws Roe v. Wade, since he is considered to be a conservative judge.
At the hearing, Kavanaugh turned aside from questions as to whether or not he would circumvent a decision of the Supreme Court.
“ This is no time for the motherly, biased person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say “it’s wonderful, ” Pelosi said.
And women need to take advantage of it.
This is a righteous proverb, a month and a year of fury flowing out of it, and it does not come out without weeping.
“ When we get angry, we cry, ” said Miss Steinem to me 45 years later.
“ I don’t think it’s uncommon, but you —
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was manager somewhere and said that she also cried when she got angry, but she had developed technology so that when she got angry and started to cry, she said to her interviewer, “You think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are permitted to express anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most clear memories of the previous job that I did in my office with men in the majority, where I began to cry out with the rage that I couldn’t express, came an older woman and took my back to the back of my neck, and she was a cold boss who I had always feared a little, and she pulled me into a stairwell.
“ Never let them see you cry, ” she said to me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you are sad and happy to have reached you —
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart when he was on a presidential commission, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught with a fiery turbulent on board a boat named Monkey Business (Apaspil) and pulled her offer back, Ms. Schroeder, felt that there was no reason why she could not consider offering herself to the president.
“ That was not a well - thought - out decision, ” she said, 30 years later, laughing at me.

She found that some of her supporters who gave her $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“ If they say I get a discount, she wonders.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not formally offer herself, she was so overcome with feelings--thank you to the people who had supported her, resentment to the system, which made it so difficult to earn money and direct her eyes to the voters instead of representatives, and anger into the gender distinction--that she broke into tears.
“ It might seem that I had a nervous breakdown, ” said Ms. Schroeder, recalling how the media responded.
“ Cleenex might seem to be my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what's going to be written on my cervix?
She cried.
Reasons that a business war between the United States and China might be good for Beijing
The first shoots in the commercial war between the United States and China were urgent, and although the war is far from over, long - term favors for Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, fired the first warning shot earlier this year by taxing China’s major export products, including solar, steel, and aluminium.
This week, the biggest score was with new customs to cover the worth of $200 billion ($150 billion), taxing as much as half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Peking has responded in the same way each time, adding 5 to 10 percent to American goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to American customs, and it is unlikely that one of the world’s largest economies will soon pass.
In order to get Washington to throw away, demands need to be yielded to, but it would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, President China to bow publicly to the United States.
However, experts say that long - term pressure from the commercial war with the United States could have a positive effect on China by reducing the mutual need for each other.
“The fact that either Washington or Peking has a policy move could lead to a situation that leads to economic collapse in one country is really far more dangerous than the viewers have previously accepted,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher who concentrates mainly on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria “ready to return, ” says the Secretary of State,“
Syria claims to be ready for refugees to return to the country and to seek assistance in rebuilding the land, which is now in bad condition after seven years of war.
Mr. Walid al Moualem, Foreign Minister, spoke to the UN General Assembly and said that the situation in the country improved.
“ Today, ” he said, “the situation on earth is more stable and safer, thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism.
The government continues to come to normal conditions by building up areas that were completely destroyed by terrorists.
All things are now ready for refugees to return to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and one - sided economic decisions aimed at combating their daily lives and jobs.
The U.S.A. estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians fled the country from the start of the war in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the land need help.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian authorities would like to accept assistance in rebuilding the country.
He stressed, however, that they would not accept aid dependent on conditions or help from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's team has won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the US final score at 16.5 versus 10.5 points on the Le Golf National field outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive European bases and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe reached its crown again when the team, under Danish command, Thomas Bjorn, reached the 14.5 points needed to conquer the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had most difficulty in the race, struck his first blow into the water of a 16th hole, par 3, and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone brightly in all his games and turned 1 out of 4 players to get the 5-0, since the competition began to use its current profile in 1979.
U.S.A. Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 against Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, who was at the bottom of the cast of the players on the European team.
Dustin Johnson, who is in the top seat on the world's top golfer list, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who played possibly in his last race for the Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times about the Ryder Cup, became the most successful European race in Europe with a score of 25.5.
“ I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
This is about the team, and I was delighted to be able to help, said Garcia emotionally after Europe’s victory.
He handed his country John Rahm torch, but he defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a solo game on Sunday.
“ I was incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him, ” said 23 - year - old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and is now registered with 13-21-3 in the race for the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange conclusion for one of the best players in history, who has won 14 big titles and is only second in line for Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled all weekend to find themselves on the field, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played a good game throughout the race.
Jim Furyk, a member of the U.S. staff, said of disappointment with the performance of his team: “I am proud of them, they fought.
It was some time in the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We dropped him.
I'll take it from Thomas.
He's a great officer.
All 12 of his players play very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with PGA in the United States, and I'll name Ryder the cup, and we'll continue.
I love these 12 men and I'm proud to be their leader.
You have to take it down.
They played better than we —
