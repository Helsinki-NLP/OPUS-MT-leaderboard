Biden leads polls in three key areas
Within just a hundred days, Joe Biden, a candidate for the Democrats, will enjoy an advance in three important fluctuations.
CNN reports today that Biden was over in Florida, Arizona, and Michigan.
In Florida, Biden estimates 51% against 46% for the president.
In Arizona, the score is 49%-45% Biden will go and Michigan will go to Biden's superiority, which is where it will lead by 12 points, 52%-40%.
To win the elections in November, after 100 days, Trump needs to turn all of these states around, and actually more.
Trump spends the days of the crowning virus epidemic that countrymen teach him to an increasing extent, saying the vast majority of the population in question have failed, or very badly, in the beginning of the epidemic.
In addition, Trump has caused bad protests and riots that sprung up at the death of George Floyd.
It says Trump and his government have reacted badly or wrongly to those matters.
To crown the troubles of Trump, he is now subject to more serious criticism of having ordered the federal police to break a protest in cities where the mayors are Democratic.
This has created enormous wolves among the inhabitants of the cities, and this anger is being passed on to the rest of the United States.
Similarly, images of federal police opposing Protestants in unmarked cars have not helped the U.S. cause.
The Lincoln Project’s Watchful Advertisement points to this very thing, but it can be seen below.
Trump won all three states in 2016, but with a very small vote.
In fact, Trump won a lot of states with a small vote and won the elections with a minority vote.
Michigan, for example, won him with only 10,704 votes.
It's less than 0.5% of the population.
Almost all the polls that political commentators say are significant are showing the same conclusion that Biden is being made.
A new CNN survey in Arizona shows that Biden’s advance has now passed through the study.
Same goes CNN and Quinnipiac University about Florida.
Even Fox News, who leans well on the right and declared support for Trump 2016, has published the same research in its media.
The President’s last hope, according to the results of the questionnaires, is that Trump could hope to re-establish the presence of important points in the labour market if attention in the campaign is directed towards the economy.
The U.S. economy suffered a heavy blow after the Covid-19 epidemic, but voters seem not to be linking the economic crisis to the crown virus epidemic.
In other words, a large majority of voters seem to blame Trump for having been at a disadvantage in responding to the crown virus epidemic, but they trust him better to deal with the economic downturn that is taking place at this time.
However, Trump has gone bad in the campaign.
Following the riots that have been on fire almost continuously since the news, as four police officers killed George Floyd, the Trump tried to direct the discussion to law enforcement and its importance.
Law and Order, became his identifying word.
Now it seems to have failed completely, as the former said.
As polls lean more on Trump, it is more likely that more and more Repubics will abandon Trump and declare support for either Biden, or any other, Biden, without specifically mentioning him by name.
This they do because of the U.S. arrangement to vote in many elections on the same currency.
In this way, the voter can simply mark the second party of the election part of the ballot, and make it the one and only vote for all its other candidates on the ballots.
In this way, the Republicans in other offices are tempted to withdraw from the slow gang of Trump and achieve independent results in the elections.
Youth Olympic Games in Dakar — Delayed to 2026
The youth’s Olympic Games were to be held in Dakar next year, but they have now been postponed to 2026 because of the crown virus epidemic after the World Olympic Committee and Senegal reached an agreement.
However, the delay in the first Olympic Games to take place in Africa is a shock to many young athletes.
A volunteer arrested for the fire at Nantes
A volunteer in the Church of Nantes, France, has been arrested in connection with a fire that destroyed the church.
Le Monde, after the prosecutor, admits that the suspected Rwandan fugitive who served as church overseer has lit the fire.
In a conversation with another media, a lawyer says that the man looks great after his actions.
Among those destroyed in the fire were the 17th - century organ and the historical imagery of the church’s windows.
The 39 - year - old volunteer was arrested shortly after the burning of July 18th, which was then released.
He was then returned to reporting yesterday, followed by a custody incident.
“ No way out of this —
I am welcomed in the home of Baltasar and Christian Samper, in Copavogi.
The occasion for my visit is the new collection of Baltasar and his daughter, Mireya, who will be opened on August 1st in the Album of Little Kambi, in Snæfellsnesi.
Is this the first time that the fathers show up together?
I am led down to Baltasar's study where a magnificent painting is on my mind.
Large and dark images of glands earlier than before but also of flying creatures; eagles on one, shadows on another.
The workhouse is located in the home.
“ We had a horse here with us, ” says Baltasar.
“The horse works much better than a lawn mower on these hills and hills we have —
Mireya is with us Christians and Baltasar, and she tells us how her actions make sense with the work that is here.
“Instructions, a combination of paperwork and cut-outs.
They are all very white and in contrast to what Dad is doing, since I'm working with the light and stuff, ” she says.
“ It’s been a year since this idea came up.
Then there were certain jobs that I was working on and that I wanted to show there, but they got stuck in Tokyo because of Covid.
When my father started painting, and I saw where he was going, I rethinked my party, says Mireya, but Baltasar’s work has a strong head start in Icelandic legends about women’s glands and fluids.
“ When I saw that my dad was doing these paintings with the candles, I felt it was good to do the jewelry that connects them, ” says Mireya, who works with the winner No Bjarnas son of a goldsmith in Sign.
\"Then I'll make a deposit out of it...
Last year, Mireya attended the 72 artists of Academia’s perception at Snæfellsnesi, including in the Lille-Kambi Palace and found the building fascinating.
“It’s a new space, an old barn that’s just finished, ” says Mireya, who talked there at the Baldvina Sverrisdódist, who suggested that Mireya and Baltasar put together a show.
“ She wanted us both to show, and then we thought:
- Why not?
This is a good idea.
Baltasar Samper was born in 1938, Spain, and attended the University of List in Barcelona before going on a world trip to study art collections and research.
He came to Iceland in 1961 and became enchanted with land and nation.
Here he came again shortly later, met his wife, Christian, and has lived here all the time since 1963, for 57 years.
Baltasar is a productive artist, has held dozens of private shows, and shows with Kristina in many places.
He is the most famous of his large tapestries, including a mural in the Flat Island Church and the Freak of the World Museum of Vidstress.
“ What influences what I do is the bitter thing Iceland has, and no other place, ” says Baltasar.
“ These suns are low, and these are the shadows that stretch and stretch.
As soon as I got here, I thought: “Wow, you can work here.
Mireya is the oldest children Christian and Baltasar, born 1964.
“ There was one thing I knew, it was absolutely clear, that I wasn’t going to be a art artist, ” she asked if she wanted to follow in the footsteps of her parents.
\"So I went to college on a math course and did everything I could to get away from it.
Then I realized I was on the run.
Then you just have to give up, ” says Mireya and laughs.
She, like her father, has shown many things around the world.
A lot in Japan, to photograph.
All the children of Baltasar and Christian have led the path of art.
“I call it a virus, ” says Mireya.

Iceandair’s count has been in gray areas when flight attendants were dismissed
The Secretary of State for Social Affairs considers Icelandas to have been in a gray area when the partner abandoned all air pilots in the middle of a reactor.
Then he says that the law that prevents firemen from entering the apartment hall will be taken into consideration after the fire on the Path of Brothers.
On July 17, Icelandair decided to terminate all 38 pilots who worked with his partner while the Air France Association’s campaign was still at the level of a state fighter.
The branch had a record of whether the Icelandas had to intervene in this matter and were prepared to resolve the matter for Society’s judgment.
This, however, never ended, was the case with Icelandair and the flight attendants for over 24 hours after their resignations.
However, Einar Dadason’s ingrained social minister says that in his mind the Icelandair decision was in a grey area and was right for employees.
“ My opinion is that this is a right to defend employees.
When you're in a conversation, when you're in there with a compromiser, it's not an option to go this way.
It is absolutely clear to me that this had not lasted.
I think it is quite clear, in my mind, that people had come into a grey area there, how it touched, ” says Angmund.
He will thus not speak for other companies going the way of Icelandair.
“You’re also now seeing a dangerous discussion that it’s only natural to start putting this system up to reduce this right, and that’s why I’m completely opposed —
At Sprengisande this morning, Angry was also asked about the government’s reaction to the fire on a brotherhood path at the end of June, where three died.
The minister now states that the case is being investigated at the level of the House and the Agency to which he refers.
“ It is inside the law today that the fire department must not enter the apartment.
I have asked the Institute for Housing and Human Resources to examine in particular whether there is reason to change legislation.
I’m ready to deal with the legal changes needed to reduce the chances that this can happen again, ” says Dr. Einar.

United States said an increased pressure on Nord Stream 2 - RT Business News
According to Welt am Sonntag, the United States government has made further efforts to force European companies to abandon the North Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is led by Russia, which refers to people who are familiar with the matter.
According to the newspaper, officials of the State Department, the Ministry of Finance and the United States Department of Energy have contacted European contractors to ensure that they are aware of the consequences of continuing the project.
Up to 12 officials should have held at least two meetings with the companies’ representatives in the last few days.
Those who witnessed the interview said that the Americans had “a friendly tone of voice that the United States wanted to prevent North Stream 2 from becoming a reality.
“ I think this is a very, very serious threat, ” said one of the girls to the German media.
These threats are in line with the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s comments last week when he warned that companies participating in the project would be best “get out now — or risk punishment according to 232 of the infamous Counciling America’s Adverse Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
In addition to the Russian energy crisis, Gazprom, which manages the project, five European companies participate in it.
These are the French company Engie, OMV from Austria, the British-Dutch company Royal Dutch Shell plus Wintershall and Uniper from Germany.
In a conversation with Welt am Sonntag, the representative of the last company said that the efforts by the United States to undermine “a major internal project — would be a clear intervention in the whole of Europe.
Earlier this week, the U.S. delegation approved an amendment to the National Defence Act designed to extend the U.S. sanctions against companies involved in the installation of the Russian North Stream 2 gas pipeline.
According to one of the law enforcement agents, the resolution may be directed at companies that pay for or provide ship, insurance, location or link service for such ships, as well as at certification for Nord Stream 2.
Both European companies and public officials have repeated their disapproval of United States efforts to interfere with European energy by imposing sanctions against North Stream 2, and some of them have even called for Brussels to work for countermeasures.
Moscow officials have also severely criticized Washington’s action, calling it unfair competition.
Earlier this week, the President of the Council, Dmitri Peskov, said that Russia would come up with a new plan for the completion of the mission if Washington councilmen were to keep the sanctions under stress.
Preparing further transport of public institutions to land
The Secretary of State for Social Affairs and Child Affairs is planning to move more public institutions to the country in the near future.
The Brunvarna area of the House and the Institute of Human Resources will be transferred to the northern part of the South in the autumn of the Council's decision, but experts in the department have previously declared that they do not intend to move to the north.
In Sprengisande, in the City Hall this morning, Einar Dadason, Minister for Social Affairs and Child Affairs, said that it was important for the rural community to be transferred to public institutions.
Hence, there is a great deal of value that also promotes diversity.
“ It’s really important to the public. We’re trying to build everything around the country.
Work-building, cost-effective building, whether in tourism, agriculture, industry, some natural use, and this type of work as public jobs, they are very supportive of their construction, says Dr.
“Creates increased diversity, creates better support for this resource and the nation’s exchange-rate creation —
The decision to move the firewood sector to the Home Office has been severely criticised by its staff and the National Association of Fire and Medical Transporters.
Six men who have special knowledge of burning matters and work in the department are all living in the capital city area, and none of them intend to move livestock to sheep’s soil.
“I think it is quite clear that there are political differences as to how hard this should be.
My opinion, and it has always been, is that we are to engage in drastic measures to spread the public ministry more effectively, ” says Angry.
“We see that our neighboring nations, Norwegians and Danes have been doing this successfully —
He says he is convinced that the majority of the people want to see more distribution in the public institutions around the country.
“I think it’s necessary to make further political decisions on the transfer of public works abroad, as I was doing with the Institute for Human Resources and Humanities —
He takes an example of the transfer of the Food Agency to Selfoss, Iceland's Landmarks to Akraness, and unemployment insurance on the Skagaststrand.
“ It’s a place of work on Skagaststrand today that matters a lot to that community.
I think we should take further steps in this creature —
“ I am preparing further steps in this creature.

At five and twenty arrests in Seattle
National racism and the United States president’s decision to send the U.S. police forces in cities to destroy riots was protested in many places yesterday.
In the 50 ’ s, the Protestants were arrested in Seattle.
Seattle police were using firearms and pepper sprays in protests there yesterday described by the police as riots.
A police officer was injured, and at least 45 Protestants were arrested.
Two months have passed since a protest against systematic racism began in the United States after a police officer killed George Floyd.
The protests were received to show unity among Protestants in Portland.
There, after the U.S. President sent the U.S. federal police forces to undisclosed cars in unthankful police forces, the police have repeatedly waged a violent conflict between the police and Protestants.
Thousands gathered in Portland for the weekend and used tear - agic and rubber - ball police as a bombardment between them and Protestants.
She owned a miracle child 47 years old.
Kenya Moore, an American real - life star, is well guided by strengthening people who need technology.
Moore, who is known for her participation in The Real Housewives of Atlanta’s program, acquired her first child 47 years after technical reproduction, calling her daughter the miracle child.
“ Almost all my life was praying to have a baby, ” said Moore in an interview with People.
“ So I know the anguish people feel, especially women, that I don’t think I could possibly have a baby —
Moore realized that she was running out of time when she turned 30.
“ I didn’t want to have a baby alone.
I didn't want to be a single mother.
So I waited and after 40 years of age, looking up and thinking about my God, said Moore, who, though, did not know her father - in - law until she was 46 years old.
One year later, they had a daughter.
The real star tells her daughter to be a miracle child in more ways than one.
In addition, as Moore was older than most of her firstborn, her daughter came into the world one and a half months before the end of the day.
Moore went to an emperor’s tomb, which proved to be difficult and took much longer than a traditional emperor’s canal.
“ I call her the miracle child because this was a child that everyone said was almost no match for me to have, ” said Moore during the interview.
Feet arrested in Mizoram with an estimated 15.4 million rupees of heroin
The domestic heroin value was about 15.5 million rupees, and so was smuggled from Myanmar, according to the police.
A man and his son were arrested with 1.9 kg of heroin in the Hnahthial region of Mizoram, near the Myanmar border, and were observed by the police on Sunday.
At home, the heroin value was about 15.5 million rupees, which was smuggled from Myanmar, according to the police.
Duhchima (62) and his son Remthangpuia (33) were arrested with drugs on Friday night in the village of Ngharchhip, said the police.
They also lost some 280 grams [280 g] of heroin, worth about 1.5 million rupees, as they swerved on their escape from the police, at the time of the official visit.
According to police reports, this is considered to be one of the largest quantities of heroin in the state.
The accused were prosecuted according to appropriate laws on drugs and narcotics (NDPS) since 1985.

The Assam riflemen recently seized 25 trucks loaded with Bethel nuts smuggled from Myanmar, worth some 40 million rupees.
Doctor ran 35 km by mask
The British doctor Tom Lawton ran in the days 35 miles [35 km] with a face mask to show that oxygen saturation did not decrease when using facial masks.
Lawton is a doctor at the Bradford Royal Hospital, and he's been working there during the pandemic.
In order to reject the theory of oxygen saturation and to encourage people to wear a facial mask, Lawton decided to run to work and return with a mask.
Before he set out, he set up a collection of GoFundMe for The Trusell Trust in Bradford and in Britain.
“ I am a great supporter of all those who keep us safe.
That’s why I’ve been in shock for the wrong information that has come across the fact that facial masks reduce oxygen saturation in people, ” said Lawton.
Lawton said that he had previously competed in a three - third race, but while the epidemic had suffered, he had suffered less.
On Monday, last night, he ran for miles 35.
“ I never took off the mask (no food or drink) and the oxygen saturation was 98% every time I looked, ” wrote Lawton on Twitter.
Prince Joakim still in the hospital
Prince Joakim of Denmark is now in the University Hospital in Toulouse, France, and his condition is stable.
The prince underwent a brain surgery yesterday after his diagnosis of a blood clot.

The prince was blessed by professionals at the time, and he is well - aware of events.
It is too early to tell how long he will be in the hospital at this time, ” says Lene Balleby, director of Danish royal halls, in written answers to the Danish national radio.
Only a few days have passed since the king’s family celebrated the 18th birthday of Felix, the son of Joakim, his next oldest son.
The birthday was celebrated at the Queen's vineyard, Château de Cayx in Cahors, South France.
The family was still on vacation when Joakim was hospitalized yesterday.
Joakim, 51 years old, moved to France last year, where he was studying in the first Dana, Ecolé Militaire, military school.
Then he works as a defense expert at the Danish embassy in Paris.
The Prince's French link is strong, but his father is his name, Prince Henry, his French and his wife, Princess Mary, too.

A plane crash in Utah: A child and two adults died in a crash in a backyard
Six people were aboard a Piper PA-32 plane that crashed in a back yard in West Jordan City on Saturday, according to Allen Kenitzer, U.S. Air traffic control spokesman (FAA).
Three of those on board died, including the 43 - year - old pilot Lee Wyckoff, his nine - month - old child, and 36 - year - old Milda Shibonis, according to the authorities in West Jordan.
The pilot’s wife is in danger of death, and a 2 - year - old child has a severe burn wound.
A 12 - year - old girl was treated and graduated from a nearby hospital, said Jennifer Worther, a spokesperson of the West Jordan police, in a conversation with CNN on Sunday.
A 72-year-old woman who was in a house that was hit by the plane is in danger of death, says the Twitter report from the police department on Sunday.
Also, three houses were destroyed in the crash, according to Tauni Barker, the spokesman of West Jordan City.
The cause of the crash has not been established.
The case is a study by the US Aviation Administration and the Swedish Transport Research Agency (NTSB).
Gottlieb warns against the unbridled spread of the crown virus in society making it “very difficult — that schools open in the fall
Washington — Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, warned on Sunday that it would be “very difficult — for school examples to open up in a new year if the crown virus spreads in these communities.
“ I believe that local school authorities need to examine how the community is distributed.
If the virus spreads freely in the community, it will be very difficult to open in that state,\" said Gottlieb of “Face the Nation”
Since the fall tooth is due to start in the next few weeks, the government of Trump had encouraged the school authorities to open their schools to students and offer teaching in the schools five days a week.
However, these attempts by President Trump and the Minister of Education, Betsy DeVos, come a week after Trump warned that the crowning virus epidemic would probably “worry before he gets better — confirming that schooling in the places where the worst situation might be the worst, it might be necessary to postpone school opening for a few weeks.
Nevertheless, disease prevention centers issued instructions on Thursday on how to be sure to open school for students.
For example, the guidelines call for distances in schools between people loyal, learners, and staff to use facial protection and for students to be divided into distinct groups to reduce the number of routes.
However, the Centers for Disease Prevention did not provide criteria for school authorities to close schools if the number of CPR infections increases, as Gottlieb says, “unlucky”
“ When this state of uncertainty and precise guidance has not been given as to how schools will be opened, I think more parents will be careful, ” he says.
“That’s why I think it is very important to get accurate information about which criteria are exactly what the Disease Prevention Centres did not provide in their guidelines —
Gottlieb told school authorities to think about the percentage of positive infections in society, local distribution, and testing ability when making decisions about whether to keep schools open or switch already to online teaching.
If between 5 and 10% analyses give a positive conclusion, the case is going to be more difficult than 10%, the threshold when carefully considering whether to close the school rooms
“ This indicates that the travel has reached a foothold in the community, ” said Gottlieb, adding that this would make things in Florida, the center of the crown virus epidemic in the United States, difficult to open to school next month.
In the United States, more than 30 countries have developed Coruna virus disease, while Colombian countries are now the center of the epidemic.
Gottlieb said, though, that there was a sign that there was a slowing down in some countries, including Arizona and Texas.
However, despite Gottlieb’s saying that it was “significant signs — that it was beginning to slow down in some countries of the sun’s belt, it is beginning to “heat in the coals — in others, including South Carolina, Alabama, India, and Illinois.
Many governors have put in place rules that oblige people to use masks in public spaces and stop the switchover re-opening in order to hinder the spread of the crown virus.
Gottlieb said that a state should consider closing bars, limiting the number of people in restaurants, closing cinemas and other places that offer entertainment indoors, and setting rules on masking to overcome the epidemic, which are measures that allow governments to avoid resetting the strict limits set at the beginning of March.
In addition to the use of masks by various countries, various companies have required people to wear facial protection.
McDonald's Sudden Guitar is the latest company to make use of facial protection and thus add to a group of companies like Walmart, Starbucks and more who have put their own rules on masking.
Gottlieb said that he expected more companies to take up their masking obligations, especially where the danger is high.
“If we can really control the epidemic when winter comes in until we get a vaccine or some kind of treatment that changes the clinical process of this disease, then we can do it by masks, that’s relatively simple, something we can all do, but that doesn’t change our lives and allow us to keep what’s very important to us, like keeping some companies open and getting the kids back to school,” he says.
Although last week Donald Trump did not say that he wanted to make masking use in the whole country, last week he urged the Americans to wear face protection and told the White House press conference that “they have an impact, ” he said.
Wilfried Zaha, who wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson: “It is time to expect...
The members of Crystal Palace were hit by the summer when Roy Hodgson, director of the Society, declared that the parishioner, Wilf Zaha, wanted to leave his partner.
The elephant coach has been playing at Selhurst Park for more than five years and now seems to be leaving, but he has previously been worded to a team like Arsenal and Bavaria Munich.
Since he is now 27 years old, it is to be seen whether a team in that quality class is still willing to pay a high sum for him, especially at the financial uncertainties of the sport this summer, after a period where Zaha scored four limits and made five support for the Palace team that caused some disappointments.
In an interview with Alex Crook at TalkSport after the last stage of the season, Hodgson said that “the story is to be expected — about the possible departure of Zaha after having confirmed that the candidate“ made it clear — that he saw his future elsewhere than with his partner.
Three more years remain for the parishioner’s contract with Palace, and last year the partner indicated that 100 million sterling coins would be needed to make his partner give him up.
The Hodgson period ended with a series of seven consecutive tabs and a draw on the last day of the period, which led to a fall in the 14th place.
Zaha found the netmasks only once from mid - December to the end of the long - shot period against Chelsea.
It was reported that he had asked for the sale last summer when he tried to get away from his partner, but no offer was made to tempt Palace to sell.
Zaha changed his agent in January, apparently to increase his chances of leaving his partner, and in the next few weeks it will be no doubt his priority to secure a social change.
Zaha is the player who played most of the minutes in the English Selection Department for the Palace during the period and was the only player in the team less than 28 years of age who played 1100 minutes or more, showing how much reconstruction on the team might be necessary to attack with the funds available for the player.
Hannah the Hurricane: The Korean Virus - Treeed Texas is faced with a great risk of disaster in “double plagues”
Weather newsmen have predicted “a disaster accident — in southern Texas after Hurricane Hanna reached twice a country and carried heavy rains and wind power up to 40 meters [40 m] per second.
When he reached the beach on Saturday, it was classified as a first-stage storm (bottom-level five-point scale) and has now been brought down to a tropical storm, but rain could still be 150-300 mm on Sunday and wind could reach 26 meters per second.
In some areas, rain has already reached up to 230 mm, including Cameron County at the Mexico border.
Hannah, who was the first hurricane of the Atlantic hurricane in 2020, and weather expert Chris Birchfield recommended that the residents be well aware: “This is not nearly finished yet.
In the last few weeks, Texas has been struggling with a massive increase in CPR infection.
The governor Greg Abbott published a disaster report for 23 cities on the way to the storm, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston, and Brazoria.
“ All hurricanes are a huge challenge.
This challenge is complex and even more difficult where the hurricane goes through an area that has become more difficult because of the COVID-19, said Greg.
The hurricane first landed at 5 p.m. on Saturday, 20 miles [24 km] north of Port Mansfield, about 10 miles [210 km] south of Corpus Christi.
The second time was not far off, in East Kennedy County.
More than 43,700 people in South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Brownsville, were without electricity on Saturday night.
An emergency service in Corpus Christi set up gardens near the corners of the street to allow them to be used if they flow across the streets.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, for a moment said that the government was watching Hannah and Hurricane Douglas, who were headed toward Hawaii, in the Pacific.
Sherry Boehme, who lives on the coast of Corpus Christi, said that the storm nearer had heightened her anxiety over the pandemic.
This 67 - year - old woman had mostly stayed at home because of health problems associated with chronic lung disease.
She said: “It’s almost like a double hit for us.
I think a lot of people are getting nervous.
We'll get through this.
It is all good and strong and stands together —
News on a blinding sailing in the South
In the summer of the south, the sightings in Southland have been unusually successful by the end of the weather.
Most people have finished their first slaughter, and there are many beats in the world, and it is expected that at the end of the summer, some will reach third.
The weather has been playing with South American farmers like the rest of the country’s population this summer, not ruining the spring on farmers’ tons.
So it's been a success.
The victory of Augustsson, a cow farmer in Birtingaholti, in the Barnacle and an instrument in a hearing is acceptable and happy.
“Yes, it’s just been doing great, I think farmers must just be steep, they’ve been doing great, having been a very good weather for the past six months.
Heyin is a very good end to the harvest good and good the hays are all over, ” says Sigurður.
A victory says that it is growing, especially in cattle farmers, that they hear of flattery or outdoors, which have been given very well, but it is much the most important thing to do in the roller - listening process.
“ It’s viable, yes, yes, it’s actually been very comfortable for the past half a month or three weeks, it’s been so dry and good and then it’s so convenient to deal with it.
There is less stress and can be stored in the morning at times what could be done today, so it is brilliantly comfortable.
But does victory mean that some farmers will strike three times?
“ Yes, I could believe it, the first ones.
We started on June 17, it might be that those who were first had to take something three times —
Original solution in the wolves - this is how they prevent injuries
The man Adama Traoré, who plays with Wolves in the English league, is a tremendously fast player.
His opposers have had it to grab him to make sure that he cannot get past them.
This has caused his shoulder to fall several times into the joint, but now the wolves have brought a solution to the problem.
The Sun will tell.
In a game of Wolves against Crystal Palace, the paramedics could see something lubricating on the shoulders of Traoré.
“ This is something we had to do to protect Traoré, ” says a source within Wolves, a child’s oil.
“ Making him smoother makes his defenses harder for him, and thus we can prevent further injury —
Traoré's shoulders first fell off a team when Wolves played against Tottenham in December.
Since then, the shoulder has fallen out of the joint four times, now last against Sheffield United earlier this month.
News of Prince Harry England: The Duke’s friend of Sussex protests claims in a new book that has been between the teeth of people
Stott, in a conversation with Sky News, said that the contents of the book about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were in no way different from those of the gossip magazines, the only difference being that the book was bound.
The former soldier wants to see an increase in water supply to the positives of his wife and her husband, such as their charity.
Stott said: “I don’t think what’s happening there differs from what we read in the gossip magazines, except now in a bounded book —
“There’s a historian who tells of it, but it’s not certain it’s coming from them.
“I think this is just another attack on them, just like the gossipers who persecute them —
“I realize that they are on the ground and people want to know what they are doing, but I wish there were more talk about all the good that they have done and their charity rather than their personal issues —
“ Of course, they never get out of it, because of their position...
The duke’s support and the duke of Sussex overshadowed another member of the royal family, according to a royal family expert.
Kate Williams, a doctor, told Sky News that the king’s family had failed to use the astrologers of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in their behalf.
She added that the king’s family’s power orders were fixed, but the public’s interest could not be guided.
She also said: “The fact is that everything they did to support the queen tended to overshadow the other members of the royal family, and this was considered a problem —
They're very popular.
“They had less weddings than most siblings in the same position. Andrew had a huge wedding. Anne also had a huge wedding.
“But although Harry and Meghan’s wedding was smaller in format than that of Vilhälmi and Katrina, the news presentation was just as big, because of the great interest of the world’s population in the couple —
Donald Trump admits that he often regrets his voice on Twitter
Donald Trump has admitted that he often regrets his presentations on Twitter as a source of war.
In an interview with Barstool Sports on Friday, the president of the United States said that his unattended remediation of Twitter records — some of which have contained material from white racism — would cause him the most trouble.
When the journalist Dave Portnoy asked him if he was looking for his posts, Trump replied: “Oft, too often.
It was like that in the old days, before this came, that you wrote a letter and said that this letter was very big.
You put it on your desk and then you came back the next day and said, “Oh, how glad I am that I didn’t send it, don’t you?
But we don't do it with Twitter.
We'll send it out right away, we'll feel great, and then you'll start getting phone calls.
I say, \"What's wrong with this--and you find out a few things--
Last month, Trump caused great anger after re-editing a second account with a video of his supporters in the Village area of Florida, where an elderly couple called “White Power” or“ Selected White”
And in 2017, Trump re-edited three entries directed against the Muslims, published by Jaydu Fransen, leader of the British First Right Party.
The president told Portnoy that the reimbursements that had put him in the most trouble
Trump said: “You see something that looks good and doesn’t examine it, you understand, and you don’t know exactly what’s on your helmet, which is a little and you don’t grow it, sometimes — I’ve found out that it’s almost always the remediation that brings you into trouble —
The president often shares praise with himself, boasting about his opponents, and conspiracies with his 80 million followers on Twitter.
Trump says Twitter helps him to get through the so - called “flag news — on television programs and newspapers, which he says is transparent with untruth.
But the President's lies have often been under the microscope, and now Twitter records Trump's as misleading.
The GPS system may be insecure
Many states are working on a different location technology from the GPS system.
According to an engineer, there may be reasons to worry about the safety of the GPS system, which is owned by the U.S. Army.
The old Loran system has been renewed.
The GPS technology will follow us every step of the way.
We use it when we fly, sail, and drive, when we measure land, in industry, and for leisure.
Most people think that it is a military device in the possession of a U.S. Army that opened it first for general use in the 1980 ’ s.
GPS technology uses satellite coordinates at 20,000 miles above the ground, and so natural conditions have little effect on it.
“ But it is very easy to interfere.
And malicious people can easily interfere with the reception of these signs, “sæmmundur E. Thorsteinsson, a lecturer in engineering at the University of Iceland and an expert on risk management and security in communications.
He also says that it is easy to send a false sign, such as in warfare.
“The GDPS system is owned by the US Department of Defence.
They have assured the public that the system is available at all times.
But certainly they can turn this off if it plunged into the head of a very selective president to do that, he could probably do it,\" says Summundur.
Hence, many countries are considering other systems and location technologies.
Both Russia and the Chinese operate their own satellite system, and the European Union is pushing Galileo out of the loop.
“Galileo’s system is primarily built up for civil use.
It may have more precision and is naturally under the control of the European Union.
Then it is not one government that entirely governs it; it is many, says Summundur.
But many have also begun to look back to the old loran technology.
It is based on radio waves and was used from the '60s until the GPS technology took over.
The Loran signs are sent on very long waves from sent down on the ground.
“It is then a new version of the Loran system, which stands for Enhanced Loran, that people are seriously considering it in many countries to have it as a system of defense, because it is a bit of a different law to interfere with it, it is much more difficult than disrupting a satellite system,” says Summundur.
However, most systems are likely to have access to them.
An experienced member of the congressman Vern Buchanan died of the crown virus
“ Gary was a professional in his fingers and a devoted servant of the public, ” said Buchanan on Facebook.
“ He touched the lives of so many and was loved and admired by those who knew him.
I will never forget his exhilaration, his sense of humor, and his unique joy in helping others —
Buchanan’s office published a declaration in the tenth of the month that Tibbett had no recent dealings with others in the office.
Tibbetts, who served outside the office, had served for Buchanan since 2011.
There have been 414,511 cases reported since the start of the pandemic, which are more than 41,200 cases in New York City, according to government health authorities.
State health records show that hospitalization has increased by 79% since the U.S. anniversary, July 4.
The data also shows that at least 50 ICUs in Florida reached tolerance levels on Saturday.
“ We reported that this could have an effect, ” said DeSantis in June.
“ At the same time, police work and making concessions could have the opposite effect —
A fly from Horna Fjord to Cape Town
Thirk doves, rosests, doves, crossnails, shindigs, and weepings are among the birds that are bound here to land for the summer.
At the bird - watching website of the Southeast Birds’ Orphanage you can see, as soon as a day goes by, brief news of the fleas, where they have been seen, and sometimes their gender.
There are many bird lovers in Iceland.
To that end, there are a number of those who like the Facebook page Icelandic bird species.
The members of the group are about 14,600.
There, pictures of birds are divided, and it is evident that Iceland is rich with good photographs that have the patience needed to form birds.
Brownjelf the son of Brynjólf is one of them.
Benna, as he is called, is a bird - observation center for Southeast and Southeast nature, and is closely watching the bird life of that area.
He speaks beautifully about these animals that enrich Iceland’s habitat and play an important role, and it does not matter whether the bird is a large and large bird of prey or a small sparrow.
The bird observation center was established in 2005 on the birthday of the half-dance of the children of Björn, in the Pacific, with the goal of keeping up with the impressive natural studies he carried out from 1940 onward.
“ He was 13 years old when he began to learn about birds, ” says Brynjulfur during a conversation with the Kernel.
“ We at the bird observation center are not doing exactly what Halfton did, but are building on his data by counting and marking birds —
A farmer and a common scientist were born on March 14, 1927.
He wrote a number of scientific articles on plants, insects, and bird life.
He died on February 10, 2017, barely nine years of age.
Half - dead and his siblings in the Kosskers grew the interest of many who met them in Icelandic nature.
Among them is Björn Gísli Arnarson, “the worker — the Bird Checker Station.
Bear grew up in the South and was richly brought to life by his neighbor, Half - Dead in the Quakers.
What, though, is it that the Coastal Bird Checkout Station is doing?
About March 20, each year, the Bird Checker Centre sets up a special one at Uniarslanding, a threefold dose inside the Bay of Horn.
Standard labelings are given here for the birds that come into the nets.
The nets will be taken down around May 10, as the time for the wartime starts.
The nets are up every day, at least from about six o’clock in the morning until noon.
And they have to visit every hour.
The incoming birds are marked, measured, and then released back into freedom.
Every hour, a journalist wonders.
“ Yes, we share it with ourselves, me, and Bjessis.
Since we now need to work for ourselves, it can be quite a puzzle, but somehow we get along with it, ” says Brynjulfur.
The nets are set up again in the period from August 1 to November 10 — every day permitted by the weather.
Brenjulf and Björn, between watching the nets and the periods they are not up to, are marking the crayfish, cuttles, and various mosquitoes where they reach them.
In addition, they take on specific tasks.
One of these projects is involved in cooperation with Iceland’s National Institute of Natural Science and is about gathering birds into the forest.
“ The forest mites leap on the birds at their winter stations and then take them here to land in the spring.
This happens shortly before they leave and therefore these ticks are not big when they arrive in Iceland.
Then he jumps off the bird and tries to find another host when he needs it —
But enough about mitts.
Asked how the birds in the southeastern part of the country were doing that summer, Brynjulfulfur says that it seems to be doing well — where it is laying over its head.
“ This is Hala, South Korea, where the mill sheds, and everything is going well.
However, there is no help anymore to be found at Jakaulsárlon, where a few years ago there was a huge wart —
He says that a few years ago, it sheds more than a thousand Chimps, but it is now possible to count them on the fingers of another hand.
“When we look at the mooring birds, I feel that it has decreased in the last few years what you find from them.
But, of course, there's always a change between years —
According to Brynfurf, what can explain that great change is probably about food supply.
\"It's all about food, isn't it?
Then man’s works can also relate to the offspring of birds and other animals.
Some birds, however, seem to have quite a good time in the southeastern part of the country this summer.
“ One of the things that I think is positive is that the dress is growing again after a lot of lows, ” says Brynjulfur, “but during the last few years and decades, the drawers have fallen dramatically —
Of sparrows, it is reported that it seems that the marian is going to do well in the heat of summer, as in the last year.
Forest trusts and dufty girls had decreased somewhat, but Brynjulfulfur says it won't be revealed until this fall how this summer turned out to be them.
But let's turn to the bad guys.
Often they attract great attention, especially if they are very rare and even colorful.
These two interesting features include one of the most popular feature of the summer: Rosestar.
“ Otherwise, ” says Brynjulf, “but the country now finds its cry, and then the doves have been seen and put to sleep here.
When Brynjulfur and Björn get into the clear, they also mark them, just like other birds.
Marks are international, and they are conducted worldwide.
There are various ways to get the meanings, such as the winter stations of birds, where they lay, and what their means of transport are.
“ Even a long flight can be seen, ” says Brynjulf.
This information is helpful in many ways, for example in the case of epidemics such as avian influenza.
\"There's always an increase in knowledge,
If anyone in the world finds a bird that has been marked by the South East Bird Checkpoint, the information will be sent to Iceland’s Institute for Natural Science.
“We have been restored from Cape Town, South Africa.
It found a crayon that we had marked.
One Bible book found us later in the United States —
A bird is especially the mind of a Brownjulf, and it is the design.
“ The sky is our bird, ” he says, “and he points out that the Bird Checkout Station and the South East Nativity Centre are the task of monitoring his offspring — which has become quite relaxed and now he has come on the list.
It is difficult to say what caused a collapse in the stem, but one theory is that the cuter made himself a prisoner of the sea that was previously thrown off fishing boats and into the sea to good than that it is now being used much better and it affects the shell.
Are you in the best place on earth to watch birds?
“ You don’t naturally make me say no, ” says Brynjulf, laughing, adding: “Since we’re now also chasing delinquent birds, we probably need to go around —
Of course, when it comes to bird life, the southeast is special.
“ This area is as if drawn into the country from Europe, and then the birds are scattered from here.
Being here to look at the birds and their birds is of great interest, but there is less to be found in breeding birds than in other parts of the country.
It is not far from a beach and a gourd, so that the area such as this is suitable for observation of birds —
But does Brynjulf have a favorite bird?
He thinks for a short time before answering.
The question is difficult.
“ My bird is dead, ” he says, “and I have found nine of the ten that have been seen on the earth.
“ I now find it most fun to take pictures of rossagauks.
It's always nice to find birds that haven't been seen before in this country or are rare, so I'm not talking about finding a new species for Europe.
But they both have Ben and Bjässi’s companions.
If you would like to monitor Benna and Bjåssa more closely at the South East Bird Monitoring Centre, you can monitor their work on Facebook and on the Birds web site.is
Saudi Arabia - The Sun Coast of the Future? No alcohol or bikini
The tourism industry has grown enormously around the world in recent years, and now the authorities in Saudi Arabia want their share of the cake.
Mindful of them, the government spends about $00,000 (U.S.) on a tourist paradise in the country.
The Guardian will tell you.
But this tourist paradise will not be in the style that we Iceland should get used to in southern Europe.
Alcohol will not be available, and women will not be allowed to sunk in bikinis.
How, then, are tourists to be lured into this strict - minded land of Islam?
This is done, for example, by building a new town where white beaches, moons (of course made by men), towed cars, and robotics serve people.
The Guardian says it's Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who wants to invest in this investment.
Of course, the money will be taken from the oil - fed land.
The Crown Prince says that it is not for discussion that women can avoid covering shoulders and knees in public places but admit that creating a tourist paradise in the country is not easy because it is too hot when the sun is high and it cannot be trusted in wind condition.
But it can be wondered whether the interest of prospective tourists will also be reduced if they are unable to buy alcohol.
Francois Bozize, former president of the Central African Republic, announces presidential proposals
The former president of the Central African Republic, Francois Bozize, who had been cast off, announced on Saturday that he would submit himself to the presidential elections in December, despite the fact that the United Nations imposed sanctions on him and that a warrant was issued for his alleged crimes against humanity.
He announced his presentation in a speech before a large group of supporters at his group, Kwa na Kwa (“work, work only — in the capital of Bangui).
This 73 - year - old former general and commander was removed in 2013 in the rebellion of the League of Muslims, mostly from the north, which plunged the majority of the nation into a violent civil war and a severe and long - lasting humanitarian crisis.
“The country needs someone with experience, peace and conviction,” said Bozize in a talk that was critical of the current President’s office, Faustin-Archange Touadera.
Bozize was first elected after his military occupation in 2003 and held a presidential office for 10 years before he fled the country in 2013.
The new government sought to arrest him for supposed crimes against humanity and for incitement to genocide, but he has not been arrested since his return from exile in the late past year.
It is not clear how the arrest orders or foreign sanctions affect their submission.
In January, Bozize said that he would ask the United Nations to remove the 2014 penalties due to intended support for armed Christian groups of Anti-Balakas.
Touadera is the leader of the country today, with the support of the vast United Nations Security Council, which has more than 13,000 military and police forces.
He was elected in 2016 and is expected to offer himself for a different term than his offer has not been confirmed.
The first round will be December 27.
In February 2019, the government signed a peace agreement with 14 armed groups that generally claim to protect the interests of certain communities or religions.
Since then, violent crime has decreased, but there are still bloody incidents that are most often caused by conflicts over resources, but the majority of this diamondic country is not under the control of the government.
Violence has forced more than 1.5 million people to flee their homes.
Gareth Bale's status at Real Madrid is “unacceptable for everyone”, says Toni Kroos
Toni Kroos, centralist Real Madrid, says the situation of Gareth Bale with the Spanish team is “unacceptable for everyone”
Bale did not participate in any of the last seven games of the team and he took a small part in Los Blancos' LaLiga celebration, and this summer, it is now known that the player intends to keep still and let his contract run out, but the partner hopes that he will disappear.
“There’s no way to avoid the situation becoming unacceptable to everyone,” said Kroos on the porter Lauschangriff Endlich was my Sport.
“ He was not bought to play as little as he is now.
I think he really wanted to leave his partner last summer and that the partner said, “Yes, but then said no — later.
I don't know if he's still a little angry about it.
When asked whether the situation had adversely affected Real’s atmosphere, Kroos said: “Not as much as you might expect.
I've known him for six years, and we've worked important things together —
Chinese give Reykjanesby 2,000 facial masks to support the fight against the crown virus
China’s ambassador, Jin Zhijian, handed over to the town manager of Reykjanes City two thousand facial masks this past week.
The visit was made by the mayor to the Chinese embassy on July 22, last year.
Video reports were first reported.
The mayor’s visit was to repay the Chinese ambassador’s visit to Reykjanestown, where he visited the hall and met with the mayor.
According to a report from Vienna, cooperation between the town of Reykjanes and the City of Xianyang has been discussed there, but the communities began their cooperation between 2014.
The 2,000 - faced gift is to be found in this town’s friendship, but the Xianyang city authorities wanted to give masks and thus support the struggle against the crown - virus epidemic.
Says in the report The report says that the masks will be used in the sensitive institutions and the Reykjane towns for both employees and other visitors who come there.
In addition to Iceland’s flag and the People’s Republic of China, the accompanying picture shows the inscription on the face mask, which says: “It’s every man behind it, except his brother who doesn’t see it —
Thomsen wants to leave KR - Calculates by lowering wages
Tobias Thomsen will try to get home to Denmark, from Iceland's world champion KR, next month and will say that he has an interest from his friends in the Danish first department.
Thomsen has played in Iceland since 2017 and become Iceland champion both by Val and KR.
However, this 27 - year - old parisher claims to miss Danmarks and wants to move there with his girlfriend, Stefania, the daughter of Jacob.
Danan’s contract with KR is valid until the end of this season, so it is clear that the Danish Society would have to negotiate with KR for its prices in August before a new season begins in Denmark.
Otherwise Thomsen would have to wait until winter to get to Denmark.
“ Yes, I know that the Danish departments are starting again at the end of August.
This means, of course, that I have to cancel my contract with KR-inges, but I've told them I miss Danmark, and they have a full understanding of it,\" said Thomsen to ball.dk.
He added that he had a very good relationship with Rúnar Kristinsson, a fully understandingd trainer, and Thomsen said that he did not think the price would be a big problem.
“ I have also had conversations with two companies after the department was completed and knew where they would end.
There has been some interest already in the coming period, so I may well go to Denmark before the Icelandic branch stops, “said Thomsen but added that there were no many companies in Denmark that could buy up his contract with KR.
“ It’s not quite clear now, but it’s been an interest.
I also need to find the best chance for me and my girlfriend, who's from Iceland and comes with me.
This depends on a few things, ” Thomsen said, saying, first of all, to the Copenhagens.
Thomsen said KRs don't have to worry that he wouldn't give himself all in practice and play, although he missed Danmarkur.
“ KR knows what it gets from me, and that is that I do things 100 percent.
I can completely ignore the fact that I miss Dankær when I’m in practice or in games, ” said Thomsen, who makes it clear that he will lower his salary to leave Iceland’s champions in the next department of Denmark.
“ I’ll probably have to lower only on wages, because of the crown virus crisis, which seems to have harassed the Danish communities a little more than those Icelandic.
But I am also studying, and one solution might be that a company got me a job.
Well, most of the companies in Section 1 have an agreement with their sponsors.
I'm learning sports management through the gaming community and I'm finishing my bachelor degree,\" said Thomsen.
Thomsen has only been in the beginning KR in two games in the Pepsi Max section of this season, but we have a history in five games and scored one goal.
He started 21 games for the team last year and scored seven marks.
KR is equal to the score of the Pepsi Max division and at the game for good, but the team is meeting K.A. at Akureyri today.

A convention against hunger pushes Yoho aside after events in the House of Congress
WASHINGTON (AP) — Regardless of the Christian organization that wants to end hunger, on Saturday they said that they had asked congressman Ted Yoho to resign from the government of the Samaritans, and that he had done so, after what they called “attack — on Senator Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio-Cortez, senator of the Democratic Republic of New York, accused Yoho, Senator of the Repúblicans of Florida, of using a derogatory and maleistic defamation as he rebuked her when they met on the steps of the Senate last Monday.

Healing and Tracing the Land on the Weekend of Traders
News of overcrowded hotels and tent areas judging, in the middle of the south, shows that Icelanders have been able to travel abroad this summer.
Have those who have set up land at the same time been fortunate with the weather and the weather supply of DV on the one hand that the summer has only been said beautifully, here to at least.
But now it is the time for a store weekend that has so far been the greatest travel weekend of the year.
Yet, it is unclear how it will be this year, compared with other weekends, because events that in the past year have drawn large numbers of people from being held.
For example, there is enough mention of a national festival.
The weather, of course, will play a major role, but now it looks like a rainstorm all over the country, but especially south and southwest.
The weather agency predicts a heel rain from Thursday night until Saturday night, at the very least.
It should be noted that long - term predictions are not sacred truths here in the northern Atlantic and are likely to make changes.
In his prediction on his bluka weather Web, the weather expert, Einar Sveinbjörnsson, says that it is a low expectant of the store’s weekend.
He says: A drop in the attic, with the associated cold that too often goes down to the surface, leads to the fact that when warmer air from the southwest tries to get closer, it only forms low with wind and waste.
True, too, warmer air “fines ” to the north.
One publishes its forecast to support, saying: “A little wave from America is moving to the east and with it a summer - hot air.
As it approaches, it reaches “blossom — in the form of a fall in air pressure and in the size of the summer season —
The Great Prediction, the Europe Center on the left on the map, and the United States GFS on the right are quite consistent with this trend.
The meaning of the low will pass through late Thursday and early Friday with a sharp A-stint and rain on most of the country.
The navigating centre of 985 hPa is followed by a follow-up.
This time some warm air in Northern and Eastern Sweden will be included on Saturday and even Sunday.
On the other hand, it may be blown along.

“ I was shot in it like a man gets such a young shot, ” says Birna Hönn Bjornsdóttir of Mariska Hargitay, the principal actress of the Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
She was so moved by the actress that she arrived at the scene of the show and waited for her for hours together, just to be able to say hi.
When Birna Hönn Björndóttir, owner of the Pink Iceland travel agency, looked like many Icelanders on the Law and Order: Special Victim Unit from the turn of the century, she looked up for the main actresses of Mariska Hargitay.
Birna tells the story of her meeting and the actress in the show Love Stories on Channel 1.
When Birna was a teenager herself, at the age that many begin to develop violent love, she did not feel like her peers, because she stood firm to suppress her own teachings.
She thought she was interested in boys’ bands and young tough - hearted movies, but she didn’t.
“ I was cutting poppy sheets and hanging pictures on the wall of Backstreet boys and Jared Leto.
But there was nothing behind it, it was just me hiding that I was a lesbian --
She says that sometimes when people come out of the closet, they go through a late gallows.
“ We spend our teens suppressing these teenage impulses, these shots, and stuff.
I think it was one of the things that attracted me to her, ” says Birna about the actress.
“ And there was something about her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm, and I was just shot at her.
A few years ago, the actress ran to the stage when she was in New York.
One of her best friends, Erlingur Otter Thorodsen, was shooting a movie there in the city, and he gave it to Birna and their friend Gunnar Helga the son of Gudjón, to help with the takings.
“ We were working on 30 people, spending a little time with strangers.
It's a naturally intimate atmosphere when you spend so long time together a day, so it was talked about everything and nothing--
Some day, it comes out that Birna is a big fan of Mariska.
One of the women in the group says a friend knows the actress because he was on the show.
Children could not stop thinking about that fact and ask their new friend regularly how her friends like to work with the actress and whether Birna can meet her.
“ She tells me to stop, she doesn’t know if she can make it happen, ” says Birna.
When the film is finally finished, the group will toast, and Birna will for the last time try to convince the woman to try to get around the meeting.
“ She had a few glasses and said that she would just fix it.
A few days later, Birna sends a message and asks if something is happening.
The woman does not respond, and Birna decides to give up.
One morning, she wakes up with long - range messages.
“ I look at the phone and yell up at me.
Gunnar Helgi wakes up at the scream and I say: I have to take a shower and I have to make myself nice and go down to town —
The woman had then written to Birna that her friend, actor, and cameraman Law and Order was at a hotel in Times Square.
“ I don’t know when they’ll start or when they will stop, but this is the name of the hotel, you’re doing well, says the messages and Birna’s dress quickly, asking at the reception where the take is going and taking the elevator up to 45th floor, where the group is assembled.
Birna arrives and waits until a woman in the staff comes to her and asks this uninvited woman if she can help.
“I say I’m looking for Jason and I asked the woman to tell him that Birna from Iceland had arrived...
When his friend finally arrives, he looks at Birna astoundingly and asks how she got all the way on the set end was supposed to be a strict security.
Birna explains that she just took the elevator and asked to see Mariska.
“ Yes, I don’t know.
Sit here, “speaks his friend and Birna is looking forward to it.
At her side, there is an extra factor, and they start talking.
“ I say to him, ‘ I’m a fan, but you’re a fan, ’ says Birna.
\"I played this as if it were the most normal thing in the world...
We're running out of time, and Birna's waiting.
The players appear regularly when a break is made, talk is made, and Birna looks around, looking for Mariska, who is nowhere to be seen.
Finally, the friend tells her that he is sorry.
Birna asks him to get into another employee's hands, but she did not think of going anywhere right away.
A wonder the friend accepts it and reaches out to another employee.
“ He comes with another friend and says: ‘ This is the woman from Iceland who wants to meet Mariska —
Then he goes.
Finally, after two hours of waiting, the new friend will be running to Birna.
“ He says: ‘ Come on. ’
These are unusual circumstances today, there are reporters with her, so she will not stop.
She's going straight to the car with them, so you have to take the chance and go downstairs and find her trailer.
It's white and it's marked.
Hurry up!
“ Then I look to the right and lose my face — the bear pulls off and takes the elevator down to Times Square.
There she finds forty trailer, some marked and some not.
Mariska’s trailer, on the other hand, does not find her, and then despair becomes to be found.
“ I feel the bend coming over because I had spent half a day in this, but I thought, ‘ Well, I tried.
That was fun.
Mistress keeps Birna back to the hotel where she looks through the window of the camera crew looking at herself with the spring windows, realizing that Birna was unable to do her job.
The bears accept fate, and it begins to rain.
“ I go under a roof to cover myself for the rain.
And then I look right and I lose my face--
No one but Marisk Hargitay stood there in her pants suit that she wore, and Birna knew very well — but Birna could hardly move with a distraught mood.
“ I look at my body and hands and think now you have to move.
Now you have to go towards her -
Birna does, and she dares to dick her shoulder on the actress.
“ She looks at me, and I can hardly say anything.
But I'll just say hello and say hello, “Birna's gonna come back.
“ I say I’m from Iceland and a big fan.
She says: ‘ It’s nice to meet you —
The call didn't go much further because Mariska's car is here and she's whistled.
Mariska turns to Birna and says: “I have to go, but it was really nice to meet you —
A girl says \"the idol,\" watching the car drive away, and then they break up.
“ I call Erling and Gunna, and they thought this had not been done.
But I was weeping for excitement and joy.
I say, \"Yes, I'll meet her.\" You have to see me now.
“ Then, ” says Birna, “we made a toast in waste water and tequila.
She does not regret anything if she admits that she would probably not repeat the game.
“ It’s like this once in a lifetime, sacrificing time and energy to make things happen.
But I'll always be a fan of this woman...
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Birna Hönn Bearnsdóttir in the show Love stories on Rás 1.
The police don't spread the virus.
There is no reason to be concerned that the crown virus can be transmitted by means of drinking reports that the police use.
This is what a police officer in the traffic department of the police in the capital area in a conversation with mbl.is.
For example, indications have come from people who worry about the use of the same mouthpiece for all drivers when the police strike, land traffic, and let everyone in trouble.
The police say the most cleanliness, though, was guarded.
“ We don’t really have a special mouthpiece, ” says a police officer, “but we have a recommendation for a cup that people blow in.
“ Some people want to put their lips on this, but we advise people to stay a little distance, up to a few dozen centimetres —
Asked if it would seem sufficiently distant, then says a police officer.
If it's a positive show, the police will use another measure.
He has a mouthpiece, which comes from a sealed plastic bag and is used only once.
Abdominal distension: Anise, including pain relief, may be reduced
The connection to depression is not a coincidence.
Individuals suffering from enteritis, a disease characterised by abdominal pain, convulsions, bloating, flatulence, constipation and diarrhoea, often experience anxiety and depression, which may lead to worsening of the symptoms of the United States’ anxiety and depression (ADAA).
“This is because the colon is partially controlled by the nervous system, which responds to stress, explains ADAA.
If the temban does not reduce, there may be an intolerance to food.
Judge tries to stop the decision to let children out of the custody of the immigration authorities
In his decision on Saturday, Judge Dolly Gee rejected the expected deadline by saying that the authorities of immigration and customs in the United States do not have to release children if one of the three ways described in her previous directive cannot be done.
However, Gee also stressed in his directive that the authorities of immigration and customs should still be obliged to release their children without undue delay.
The three ways that Gee suggested are to release families in custody of immigration and customs authorities, to put children in the hands of a responsible person, or to release families for a federal decision.
Shalyn Fluharty, director of the Institute Proyecto Dilley, who provides families with legal services, condemned the decision and told her to put it in the hands of the immigration and customs authorities to decide whether to continue with children.
“The main thing I think is that children are kept in time and released only by the authorities of immigration and customs, or families agree to be broken down,” said Fluharty.
Families are held in three locations of immigration and customs authorities in Berks, Pennsylvania, South Texas, and Carnes County in Texas.
The children in these places are between 1 and 17 years of age according to lawyers and law enforcement officials.
In June, Gee, in charge of the implementation of the Flores Convention on Child Care, said that since “the rules of masking and social exclusion were not or poorly followed, it would be urgent to move children from this establishment.
969 persons in custody in the authorities of immigration and customs have been identified with the crown virus and are in isolation or surveillance from and including 23 July according to the authorities of immigration and customs.
Of these, 25 cases are confirmed in Karnes, one in Dilley, and two in detention centres for families.
A total of more than 3,700 cases have been confirmed in custody
Will review the law on the independence of the rulers
The Prime Minister does not say abnormally that living funds set a standard in their investment policy on the rights of working people.
The comments made by the Governor of Central Banks on the need to ensure the independence of the directors of pension funds, possibly by law, will be taken into consideration.
After Icelandir cut off the Icelandic Air Forces Association and gave notice to all air pilots, VR announced that directors appointed by VR under the life support fund or voted against participation of the LIFE fund in the expected part-sessions of Icelandas.
Ragnar Thor Ingólfsson, chairman of VR, went on to say that rulers would be replaced if they did not respond.
Ragnar Thor withdrew three days later, as did VR’s government.
Ásgeir Jonsson, the bank manager of the bank, told the RUV on Friday that it would be necessary to ensure the independence of the pension fund directors in approved funds and possible by legislative reform.
Catherine Jacob’s daughter, the prime minister, says that the directors of the pension fund are independent, but they already believe it to be guaranteed by law.
“Now, ” she says, “the banker, who, of course, carries out financial supervision that involves this, has said that there is a need for special scrutiny of the rules around this independence.
Katrin says that the law of the LIFE Fund sets moral standards in its investment policy.
It is desirable to discuss the social and moral standards that they want to highlight in their investments.
“ I didn’t think anything unusual, too, that living funds also set standards in their investment policy on the rights of working people.
But I think that such decisions are made through a policy rather than through a few investment decisions, says Katrina.
“Insufferable traffic jams at Alfusárbru,” says the President of the City of Aarhus
The Helgi S. Haraldsson, President of the City Board of Stockholm, says that traffic congestion, formed at Alfusárbru on Selfossi, is totally unacceptable every day.
He hopes that new bridges will be offered over the River Alfie in the autumn.
Now that Iceland is travelling through its country and there is a great deal of traffic on the highways of the country, there is a daily traffic jam at Alfusbru when drivers are on their way to Selfoss or through the community.
Long lines are formed at the bridge and can take on the patience of drivers to wait in a row.
“Yes, it’s totally impatient, it’s one traffic jam here and not only on Fridays because it’s just been on active days as well.
There are long docks, sometimes quite up on Hellisheðier for those who want to get by on their way east to land and those who are coming west, so it gives an eye to need a new bridge and no later than yesterday preferably,” says Helgi S. Haraldsson, president of the city’s city government in Aarhus.
Helgi says that the town authorities of Árborg recently met with the head of the Road Administration and the designer of the Road Administration, and that meeting was very positive.
“If you’ve ever been optimistic about the fact that it’s working on these issues, I think I can say it now because it’s really working on this, and we’re going to be able to see that a new bridge will be offered in the fall”
But is there any advice for those drivers who line up at Alfusbru every day during the summer?
“ Yes, it is possible to go narrow and through the Eyrarbank, it is quick but those who are going east on the bank, it is not possible to point out that they are going to the Lyngdalsheið, but those who are going to the riots should use Mosfellsheið, Congress and Lyngdalshei —
The weekend of S. Haraldsson, President of the City of Aarhus, who says the traffic jam is formed at Alfusárbru on the impatience of Selfoss.
Long - standing docks are formed every day at Alfaarbru and often need drivers to wait for a considerable amount of time to cross the bridge.
It is the only way to take a deep breath and think positively.
The future of the restored koalabjorn in the northern part of Brisbane takes place in an orderly judgment
In addition to the area’s vital home to koalabjarna, marshmallows, and gray glyphs, the city government said that it was an important link between the natural areas of Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek.
They have appealed to the Civil Service Tribunal’s rejection of the Charter of Organizational and Environmental Laws, arguing that the structure is in conformity with the Civil Code since 2014, would meet unmet organisational and social needs and would be \"applied without unacceptable effects.\"
There is great opposition to these planned activities in the area.
The operators argue that despite the fact that it is fully in line with the organization, it could be changed if it does not meet the requirements, rather than reject them.
At present, the project involves many stages, including service stations, child - care facilities, and 39 apartment buildings.
Official transmissions were more than 120 at the time of consultation, and most objected to the suggestion, since it was too large and inappropriate for the area.
The minority leader of Brisbane told us that the city had to buy the land to protect its koalabirn.
“[The mayor] Adrian Schrinner needs to stop wasting taxes against the contractors and buy this country to protect Brisbane’s natural and animal life, ” said Mayor Cassidy.
“This is one of the most important homes of the koal bears in the natural area Mountain to Mangroves, where there are many koalabjarnas —
Schriner said this week that the government wanted the koalabarna to be restored in the area.
“We didn’t find anything suitable for the area,” said Schrener.
“ I understand that this is going through the system of judgments, and clearly we hope that it will bring forth good and positive results that will keep our home alive, ” she says.
Schriner said that mapping the local koalabjarna is a shared responsibility for the city’s government, but that the government is responsible for precise maps of the home of the koalabarna that local authorities support when they make applications for implementation.
Sunshine: The next step is to win something.
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Coach Man Udd, was hoping that the team had secured a third seat in the English Selection Department today.
The team will therefore be playing in the European Championship in the next period.
United needed a draw or victory against Leicester today and was the result of a 2 -0 victory of the Red Devils.
“ It’s an excellent achievement for the players to make their third place according to their situation during the period.
I think we the lads might have got over a spiritual gap by working such a big game, since we've lost twice in the preconcepts of this period.
We knew that we needed a final look today, now we can start the next chapter that is with these boys to win a title, “sunskreek said.
Manchester United still has the chance to win a title during this period, but the team is playing in the European Department in August, and it is as good as it is in the 8th-century playoff there.
A ceasefire begins at midnight in a war - torn East Ukraine
Kiev, Ukraine — Ukraine’s army and forces in eastern Ukraine are now preparing “a complete ceasefire to begin at midnight and as representatives hope to be the first step toward peace after 6 years of conflict.
On Sunday, protesters told them that they had ordered a ceasefire and issued a ban on the use of weapons.
Ukrainian armies said their forces “have prepared for the ceasefire.
If this were to be done, it would “make the way for the implementation of other provisions — the Minsk Peace Agreement, as announced by President Ukraine’s office earlier this week, where the ceasefire was called a time-limit.
The objective of the Minsk Peace Agreement, which was made in 2015 by France and Germany, was to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and the separatists who enjoy the support of Russia, which began in 2014 following the accession of Russia to the Crimean region and the support of the country in the case of separatists.
More than 14,000 people have died in the fighting.
The presidents of Russia and Ukraine both welcomed the ceasefire on Sunday and stressed the importance of the agreement reached in Paris in December.
Vladimir Putin, president of Russia, expressed concern at the call for the Minks Convention to be reconsidered and said that Volodimir Selenski, President of Ukraine, about “the unchangeableness of the Minsk Convention, which he once again expressed in this telephone, should be reflected in real action.”
However, Selensky stressed the need to take action to free the Ukrainian rebels in East Ukraine, the Syrians and Russia, as announced by the President’s office.
According to the 2015 agreement, Ukraine can only have control over the borders of Russia in the territories of the separationists when they have acquired extensive self - control rights and when elections have been held in the territories.
The convention slowed down, but Ukraine’s army and rebels have continued to engage.
When the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris in December for another interview, support was given to the Minsk Convention and agreed to resume the process of peace.
Selenskiy, who won the elections in 2019 with the promise to end the conflict, wanted Ukraine to have jurisdiction over the borders for the first district inquiry, but the Kremlin government insisted that the agreement be concluded without change.
The new ceasefire agreement was reached on Wednesday through the three-sided cooperation group appointed as Russian and Ukrainian representatives, as well as the European Security and Cooperation Agency, and was therefore welcomed by the EU officials.
During the traditional Sunday celebration of Peter’s day, Pope Francis also mentioned the ceasefire and said that “rebuilding confidence and laying the foundation for very necessary and long - awaited agreement with the people ” —
Police: A man shot to death in protests in Texas
AASTIN, Texas (AP) — A man was shot to death in protests in Texas when he approached a car and the driver in the car was fired by his weapon, according to the police.
Catherine Ratliff, the police spokesperson, told reporters early Sunday that the shooting had taken place just before 10:00 p.m. to a protest in Austin.
The man was moved to a hospital where he was later executed.
The car had whistled, bent down the road, and then speeded up the journey towards Protestants, said the witness Michael Capochiano to the newspaper Austin American-Statesman.
According to Capochiano, the man carrying a rifle approached the vehicle and was shot off by the driver.
The driver then drove away, said Capochiano.
Ratlif told reporters that the first report indicated that “the victim may have had a rifle — and added that the suspect is in custody and is willing to cooperate with the police.
According to news agencies, the group had gathered for the Black Lives Matter protesters on Saturday.
The protesters were streamed live on Facebook, where the whistle was heard and a few shots fired off.
Marke soup in the First Winning Blika in July
Breidablik won his first departmental victory from June 29th, when IA was defeated, 5-3, in Pepsi Max's division, on Copavog's field tonight.
In contrast, hypocrites lose their third consecutive game in the league.
After winning his first three games in the league, Breidab played five games without celebrating victory and had lost three in a row for the IA game tonight.
It was, therefore, to do or die for a Blyke who came with great force into the game.
Alexander Helgi The son of the Winner was the leader of the team with a proper cover at 11 minutes after the son of Christian Steindór had sent him through IA’s defense.
Then, six minutes later, the Christian doubled his leadership after a fine preparation for the son of Eyloff Gísla from the left side.
They were unable to make land or beach during the first half of the race, where the high - pressure locals made it tremendously difficult for them to connect.
All the beams had power over the field and had the third goal in 36 minutes when Danin Thomas Mickeyn cut in the corner of the land son of Gunnlaug.
Then the Christian son of Steindór scored another goal and the fourth goal of Binka just three minutes later.
But the story of the first half did not end there.
The hypocrites had a sense of hope for the second when Frägvi Hrafn Haraldsson cut out a critical challenge shortly before a break, but Kwame Quee had then broken the clumsiness of Viktor Jonsson within Blika.
4-1, therefore, was the position for Breiblak when the half - game plug was broken.
Only three minutes had passed when the Skagimen once again scored.
The son of Saevar was then alone and unelected on the spot of Blyka and easily controlled the ball on the net after the corner of Sikva Hrafn the son of Harald.
However, only three minutes later when he broke Alexander Helga, Hlynur was a criminal.
Vitaspärna was convicted, and Thomas Mickeysen scored security to get Breidablik 5-2 over when only seven minutes were completed of the second half.
Five minutes after Mikkelsen's goal, the Skaga again scored.
Anton Ari Einarsson, the goalkeeper Blika, was under pressure from Viktor Jonsson, gave the ball in Viktor’s leg where the ball rejected the net.
Amazingly, 5 - 3 points were encountered when less than ten minutes were completed by the second half, followed by a slowdown in target score.
Despite the fine range of both joints to add to the limits, including two dead bodies of Kwame Quee from Breidabliki, they did not gain more than 5 - 3 wins of Bredablik’s playoff.
Breimablik won his first win for less than a month, from June 29, and has completed his victory with 14 points in third place, two points from Val, which is higher than the seat, and three from KR.
KR and Valur, however, have both a game in Bink.
The IA needs to settle for the third consecutive loss in the division, but the team has ten points in eighth place, five points from drop.
Despite the White House’s speech, no danger exists.
Producers of the Volcano’s plant were entitled yesterday not to stop displaying the child material in the near future.
Following this statement, Kayleigh McEnany, a White House media officer, commented that the factors dealing with law - enforcement dogs were victims of “outcast culture ” (e. cancel culture).
Canadian producers quickly responded to McEnany’s words and expressed that their fans did not need to worry about the future of the Volcano.
A number of TV shows dealing with police activity have been removed from a recent exhibition in the United States following a protest wave against police violence.
In spite of its reputation on social media, however, the U.S. organization is not one of them.
At a White House press conference on Friday, McEnany said that the President of the United States — especially when it came to the police — was opposed.
The term refers to the fact that comments, actions, or businesses give rise to a severe reaction on the social media, and is called after the party has been rejected for protest.
“ We saw a few weeks ago that shows in the Volcano, children’s material about cops, were stopped.
Similarly, the components of Cops and Live PD said McEnany on Friday.
Then she added that Danish toy manufacturer Lego took out legal protection, but there is no foot for that claim, according to Lego’s defenders.
However, it is true that the Cops and Live PDs have recently been removed from the Western Ocean exhibition.
Both participants are involved, among other things, in showing pictures of real police activities without getting permission from persons who appear there.
Together for 29 years - Sometimes jealousy and suspicion arise
Kristín Thomasdóth family therapist answers questions about family, children, and love in the family corner of DV.
On this occasion, she answers readers who have never been single.
We have been together since we were 15 years old, have been together for 29 years, and have two children.
We know nothing but to be together and feel good, but both of us have felt as though we were missing out on something.
We have never been with other people, and we have no comparison of how this could be different.
This has sometimes led to jealousy and distrust in relation to whether the other person is looking around him, thinking of adultery, or even divorce, and changing his mind.
When we discuss this, we agree to cultivate our relationship, but this is the kind of nightmare that always hangs over us.
Do you have any advice?
Thank you for a wonderful question and a great deal of joy that you have such open communication that you can discuss your complex feelings in connection with your relationship.
What would scare me would be if you were thinking about it at each corner, couldn't talk about it, and even take some step that you might later regret.
Everything on tables, isn't it always the best?
A strong sense of self - worth has the most predictive of future happiness and of the stronger self - image you have, the more likely you are to have a strong sense of self - worth.
The reason why teen - age relationships do not always last a lifetime is often that people develop in either direction, but in those cases where they become additive, they may become stronger overall than many others.
Since your relationships begin to develop in your major formative years, you can conclude that you have matured together and have a positive influence on each other’s identity.
We are molded by our relationships.
The way I speak, the way you listen.
The way I show myself depends on how you see me.
Associations between us and each other.
Could you turn around and think, ‘ What do we have that others don’t? ’
What does this many years of specialty mean for us?
I may claim that the benefits may be far more than the defects.
You have shaped each other for years, so you can say that you are specially designed for each other.
That's more than many people can say.
This is worth it?
You talk about the fact that you have missed something, but it is important to remember that major changes, such as divorce and new relationships, also follow the following fish that you are not necessarily excited about.
You may miss starting over, learning to be alone again, getting to know a new person, and putting together families.
These include new challenges, different problems, and possibly new and exciting things.
But this is not just a pink cloud and happiness, but at your age, it can become a messy task, which may never be as good as you have already done to each other.
Is it worth it?
Nor would it be wise to put the focus on what you can do to increase tension, unforeseenness, and innovation in your relationship?
You haven't put your shoes on the shelf yet.
There are so many things you can do to make this long relationship even deeper.
What attempts can you make in connection with this?
What do you need from your mate that you are not receiving?
What can you give to your mate that you have never done before?
You may need to sit down and redefine your relationship.
Do you want to spend more time alone or together?
Would you like to try something new?
Today there is much more tolerance to various forms of communication, and couples have begun to define their relationships in various ways, such as an open relationship, a multifaceted relationship, or a decision to stop together temporarily.
I'm not at all telling you what to do, although no expert in your solutions, but possibly it would ease this heavy fat that lies on you, if you face this and think in solutions.
What do you need so much confidence and fear?
You've been together for 29 years, which must mean you're capable of doing things together.
Use it as strength and hold hands toward your solution.
We encourage readers to send their questions and gifts to Kristín by e-mail to: heonabandssela@gmail.com.
The questions will then be answered here in the family corner, of course, without a name and in full confidence.

Coleen Rooney commands lawyer Johnny Depp in the Wagatha Christie struggle with Rebekah Vardy
Coleen Rooney has asked David Sherborne to defend himself against charges against Rebekah Vardy
After the footballer’s mate went out, their acquaintances would expect a dramatic settlement.
Coleen Rooney has hired the superintendent in Johnny Depp’s controversial case to defend himself in his so - called “Wagathha Christie ” dispute with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday mimics that Rooney has entrusted David Sherborne with defending herself against the accusations that she had sustained damage to Vardy, claiming that personal information has been leaked to the media of her closed Instagram access.
The news arrives a few days after data were submitted to the Supreme Court, which states that Rebekah Vardy, who is married to the parishor Jamie Vardy in Leicester City, suffered physically and spiritually from Coleen Rooney’s claims.
The magazine notes that the 38 - year - old mother “has suffered severe panic attacks and anxiety attacks, so she was afraid to leave the house — and that Vardy, who was then seven months pregnant,“ had been hospitalized three times... because of an anxiety attack caused by the entry and its consequences, ”
In addition to being Depp's lawyer in his case against The Sun, because of claims that the actor beat his wife, Sherborne, 50 years old, speaks the Duke and Duke of Sussex in their private language against Associated Newspapers, publishers The Mail on Sunday.
After negotiations between the two soccer friends failed, those familiar with dramatistic court settlements were expected.
“If you found the Depp trial, don’t underestimate the expected war of your football friends, ” said one source.
Coleen doesn't give up, neither does Becky.
Coleen Rooney claimed that someone who used Instagram access to Rebekah Vardy had leaked the information about her to a newspaper.
She was named “Wagatha Christie — after having made it clear how she lasted five months to gradually limit the number of friends who could see updates on the Instagram stories of her, until only Vardy’s account remained.
Coleen said that he had made a history of Instagram, which had since appeared in a gossip magazine.
In Vardy’s objection to the case, she argues that after Rooney published the accusations “to a deliberate order, with the aim of causing great harm and enormous suffering,
Coleen’s lawyers have questioned these words, saying that claims about their suffering are merely put before the media and drew attention from the facts.
One source said: “The evidence from Becky is a hoax, it’s all divisive.
It is lawyer Paul Lunt of Brabner’s local law firm in Liverpool, Coleen Rooney, who has four sons with former England champion Wayne Rooney.
Vardy's at the law firm Kingsley Napley, London, is not sure if she's still hired a lawyer.
Coleen Rooney, a spokesman, refused an interview.
Voting team Bidens refuses Fox News Sunday - interview one week after interview Chris Wallace with Trump
In an interview with Chris Wallace last week, the President of the United States doubted that the future presidential candidate, Joe Biden, would deal with the question issue that Wallace had dropped on Trump.
We may never get an answer to that question — at least not for now.
On Sunday, Wallace informed the audience that Biden’s campaigning team had told Fox News that he was “not available — for interview.
“ In our interview with President Trump last week, he doubted that his opponent in the Democratic Group, Joe Biden, would plow himself in similar circumstances, ” said Wallace.
“In the week, the election team Bidens asked for an interview, and they said that the former Vice President wasn’t free...
“ We keep asking each week, ” he added.
For months, the Trump campaign has criticized Biden for avoiding a campaign and a press conference while he is attending interviews while the crown virus epidemic is going on.
Although Biden has recently started his campaign again, Trump and his associates have still scoffed at the vice-president's former vice-president for “hiding off” in their home in Delaware.
However, the slowness of Biden to attend public events has not been adept at his presentation, as recent studies show that Biden has a good head start on Trump, both on national level and in the major fighting countries.
The averages of Real Clear Police indicate that the president was 7 percent below Florida, 6.7 percent in Pennsylvania, 8.2 in Michigan, and 6.4 in Wisconsin.
Trump worked in all four kingdoms in 2016 as he turned them over to the Republicans when he fought for the White House.
In Fox News Poll's latest survey, Biden has a head start in Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, outside of an ark in all cases.
Studies also suggest that Biden has a little head start in Ohio, North Carolina and Arizona, three other important fighting countries in these elections.
And surveys indicate that nations that once were the strong strongholds of the Republicans, such as Texas and Georgia, are now divided between Trumps and the vice president’s former vice president.
The Presidential Presidents who are present for a second term in the White House are often voting for that president — and this appears to be the case now in 2020 in the fight between Trumps and Bidens.
The most important issues have been the crown virus and the economy that is low due to the epidemic — and the performance and history of the president in both parties.
Kanye West and his wrestler
Musicist Kanye West today prayed to his wife, Kim Kardashian, to apologize for the comments he had suffered in a man - made manner.
The chairman of the mental - health team thinks he's going to get his creative power from mental health, but a psychiatrist says it's important that people take medication to control their illness.
Not only is Rapparin Kanye West one of the most original and influential musicians of his day, but it is just as famous as the husband of the real world star Kim Kardashian.
His personal life has been largely open.
Early in that month, he announced that he would forward himself to the president of the United States and gave an emotional and undivided speech.
Later, some peculiar things appeared from him on Twitter, where he claimed, among other things, that his wife was trying to put him in a hospital.
Kim Kardashian later published a statement on Instagram asking people to show understanding to their husband and family; he was suffering from bipolar disorder, and it would be difficult for his loved ones to help him if he would not seek help himself.
He has then apologized to her publicly.
This famous family is not alone in dealing with this problem.
It is estimated that about one percent of the people suffer from mental illness.
Ferdinand Jonsson, head of a mental - health clinic in London, knows the disease well.
“ This disease can cause so much distress to individuals, especially to families and their loved ones.
This mania or mania can destroy relationships and work and cause unswerving sorrow.
And then the other side, the depression, it's often very dangerous, because there's a high rate of suicide in that group.
So I thought it was nice for her to say that.
And it’s just human and human, ” says Ferdinand.
Unnsteinsson, chairman of the mental health department, himself has been dealing with a mental disorder — and is a fan of Kanye West: “He seems to have a very bold imagination.
If we are four strings of earth-bound double bass, he is a hundred strings of heavenly harp.
And he is so overly creative, excruciatingly powerful and intelligent in his powerful mind of communication, because you will be aware of this bonding thought that we have been given to try to cope with manic conditions so well —
Kanye West doesn't want to take psychotherapy, because he thinks they're pulling out his creativity.
He has discussed mental health, including on the album Ye.
He says it's his choice not to take drugs.
“ Many people feel that this creative element is bound up with this unsolicited thought and excessive creative force of the fire he has, but then, naturally, the flaws of suffering are often great, and the waves and the valleys of darkness and basements —
However, it is important that people with bipolar disorder are treated.
“ If you have a lot of passion or mania, you’re not making wonderful things, you’re just on your side.
And just as people suffer from severe depression, people are totally paralyzed by that condition, ” he says.
So you would advise Kanye West to take a medicine?
“Alright, ” says Ferdinand.
“And especially to work with someone to find the right dosages and this way to balance the medicine’s greatest help, and to destroy the least for him and his abilities and his creative power —

“A patient — an ambassador wants a gun, a armored car, and a sting vest said the subhumans were the ambassadors of the “deep state”
A political ambassador of the United States, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, is said to carry firearms in CBS news today.
“ Despite being placed in one of the world’s safest states, ” says CBS, “Jeary Ross Gunter is“ a man who is in need of safety since he arrived in Reykjavík last year, ”
Refers CBS to 12 diplomats, executives, and former representatives as well as individuals familiar with the case.
Gunter’s conclusion was to demand from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs that they request permission for the ambassador to take up arms in this country.
He should also have wanted a armored car that traveled with him from one place to another in Iceland to the other.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs refused to comment on any threat to the safety of the ambassador, but representatives of the U.S. government said that the ambassador was told that Iceland is a safe country and that it is safe here.
However, CBS says that lifeguards in Icelandic magazines have been advertised, and if this has helped to meet the ambassador’s demands.
CBS reports that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not want to comment on the case with CBS.
However, the U.S. news agency of its sources in this country has said that no request has been received from the governments.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter was spoken of walking about armed forces, where it would insult Iceland’s host country.
The ambassador paid his dues for rich support to Donald Trump's campaign fund in the 2016 presidential elections.
He used to be a dermatologist in California.
Since Gunter’s arrival in Mai, he is said to have created “an impossible place of business in the embassy, and he has already had seven subhumans, called the Deputy Chief of Mission, the subordinates of the ambassador, who are also sent to the diplomats.
Were they all tested diplomats from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
The first one was sent away by the ambassador “because he didn’t like his appearance —
Had he already prepared for a year and learned Icelandic.
The next one lasted only six months.
Thereafter, a staff rotation was made, and the thought was to let Gunter measure as most until he looked at one of them.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter was looking for the embassy’s staff to go on “the deep state — and to undermine him against the State Department in Washington, D.C.
The officials of the D.C. Department of Foreign Affairs are said to be well aware of the situation in their mission in Reykjavik, but have been reluctant to intervene in the independence of the embassy in the light of Gunter’s connection with the White House.
It is also said that Gunter had difficulty following the orders of the State Department in Washington, and he was said to have refused to return to D.C. while the Covid-19 passed away.
He left the embassy in the hands of his staff for months.
After he has been told to work from his home in California, the minister himself, Mike Pompeo, will return.
At last Slash Back
Finally, upon receiving the order, Gunter returned to Iceland in May.
His new subordinate, Michelle Yerkin, came to the country in those months.
CBS has not received any answers to their inquiries to the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
The State Department did not want to communicate with CBS, nor did DV ask.
Gunter is one of the many political ambassadors of the Trump government who have been paying attention to extraordinary behavior in the past month.
Woody Johnson, for example, showed a severe reaction when he came to the day that he was trying to move the British open tournament in golf on a golf course in Trump.
At the same time, the ambassador of South Africa has been charged with running his number two and has tried to put her son in the job.
42% of U.S. ambassadors are appointed politically.
30% were appointed politically by the Obama government, and 32% by the George W. Bush government.
The protesters and police in Seattle together for the plans to send the FBI
The Seattle police used blast bombs and pepper sprays on Protestants who set fire to work-wheelers at a youth prison on Saturday, following an angry public wave because of President Donald Trump's plan to send FBI troops into major cities.
Repeated bombs swept through the streets of Seattle City in Washington State and smoke came from the place where Protestants had carried fire to trailer houses in the building area of the juvenile prison.
The conventioners cut down on a car deck and broke a window in trailer.
The rioting police used themselves against Protestants, some of whom held umbrellas to protect themselves from the pepper spray capsules that rained over them.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 were arrested because of suspected attacks on police, for preventing police work, or for refusing to leave the area.
Poland will report on the European Convention for the Prevention of Violence against Women
Poland’s right-wing government says that it will withdraw from the European Convention for the Prevention of Violence against Women.
The Istanbul Convention is the first binding legal instrument in the world that aims to prevent violence against women, while the Polish Justice Minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, describes the text as “harmful — requiring schools to teach children about sex from a sociological point of view.
Ziobro said on the weekend that on Monday he would begin to prepare a formal process for the country's disclosure of the contract.
“This ideologie is linked to attempts to change education in schools and leisure activities, in terms of education, attitudes and convictions of the young generation of Poland, on the basis of the conclusion that our opinion is wrong, that biological gender is old-fashioned and that everything is actually social culture —
Ziobro believes that the provisions of the agreement on education for children and young people as well as family ties in the context of LGBT are unacceptable.
“We also reject the LGBT elements in the discussion on family ties, because this is a view held by left parties or groups of homosexuals who want their opinions to become binding laws, ” he said.
The European Council stated on Sunday that it was “safe — because Poland was happy to tell itself about the agreement.
In Warsaw, on Friday, some 2,000 people, including women and other groups of rights fighters, protested outside Ordo Luri’s office supporting the country’s declaration of the agreement.
“ We won’t be victims, ” they were called.
Objections also took place in other cities in Poland.
Poland signed the Istanbul Convention to prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence in December 2012 and validated it in 2015.
Maurice Petty, a engineer at the Heiden Palace, aged 81.
KANSAS CITY, Kansas (AP) - Maurice Petty, a part of a quarter - mile - long - travel empire, which includes his father Lee and his brother Richard, and which was the first engineer to be taken into the Nascar Palace, died on Saturday.
He was 81 years old.
Petty's family didn't give up his cause for death.
His funeral has not been reported.
While his other family members were boasted for their abilities behind the wheel, Maurice Petty earned the nickname “The Boss — For His Skills With the Screwbar.
He helped his family to win 198 races and seven titles in NASCAR's final department, and also built machines that guaranteed the victory of the Honorary Society of Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal, and Pete Hamilton.
“ The boss was one of the most advanced machines in NASCAR’s history, ” said the chairman and manager Jim France.
“ He brought the power that helped Petty Enterprises to gain his advantage in the sports field.
Even though Maurice was known for his work under the hood, he also performed various roles behind the tents and did what was needed to get his vehicles on the racetrack —
Maurice Petty was born on March 27, 1939 in Level Cross, North Carolina.
He followed his father to the racetrack when he was small, and his knowledge of motorization soon became an important factor in the country of Lee Petty’s 54 races and three championships.
He competed 26 times in the NASCAR Cup in 1960-64, was seven times in the top five seats and 16 times in the top 10.
Soon, however, he decided to focus on what is happening under the hood rather than behind the wheel, which proved to be a good track for his older brother, who relied on his machines for his triumph.
Richard, who was then called \"The King,\" won the first championship, along with the Star in 1964, with the Plymouth automobile.
They won again in 1967, for two consecutive years in 1970 and 1971, and reached three more titles before the 1970 ’ s.
With these seven titles on their backs, they measured the largest number of titles with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson.
“Maurice Petty was one of the true pioneers NASCAR and was involved in his process at Petty Enterprise in building up one of the top teams in NASCAR,” said Winston Kelley.
“ Even if Petty’s victory is recorded as 212, he calls for well over 250 wins, if they have all the machines he built for his competitors.
The boss will be remembered forever as the greatest robot in NASCAR’s history.
Lee Petty died in 2000, and Patricia, the wife of Maurice Petty to 52, died in 2014.
He was also the uncle of the former motor vehicle and the mediaman Kyle Petty and Trent Owens, chief of staff at the pickup race.
“ Even though we now say goodbye to Maurice Petty, one of the true and successful pioneers and the heroes of NASCAR, his legacy and name will be stored in our memories, held up and preserved forever,” Kelley said.
\"We send our deepest sympathy to the Pettys,

Forces destroy camps and take down their troops in Zamfara State
Air raids by the flight division of the HADARIN DAJI have destroyed a new army camp under the so-called “Dangote” of the Doumborou Forest in Zamfara State.

BELGRAD, Serbia (AP) - Serbia will strengthen her army and seek to buy more military aircraft as tensions grow in the Balkans, said the president of Serbia on Sunday.
President Vucci said that “certain searches are in the process of buying a fleet of fighters, and accused the United States and other Western states of armaments of neighboring Serbia, NATO, as well as Kosovo, former Serbia.
“ Americans, Turks, and Germans take good care of their beloved offspring, ” said Vucic, referring to Kosovo.
He said that the United States had recently handed over to Kosovo a number of armored cars.

Vucic did not specify the type of Serbian military aircraft to buy, but the media sideways the government has publicly requested the delivery of 20 attackers from the United States.
It says that Washington did not respond to the request from Belgrade and that it is rejected, it is likely that an attacker from Russia will be purchased from Sukhoi-25.
Serbia, a military neutralist policy, has recently been given a highly developed air - defense system from Russia, which has also provided battle jets, attack helicopters, and armored vehicles.
China, which is also Serbia’s League of Nations, has handed over the country’s movements for military use.
U.S. officials have been openly discussing criminal proceedings against Serbia if more weapons are brought to the country from Moscow, especially weapons that could endanger the security of nearby NATO member states.
In Western and neighboring Serbia, people are concerned about the arms region of Russia and the Chinese in Serbia.
Today, tensions are increasing in the Balkans, where man - made civil war took place in the 1990 ’ s.

Heart attack: The likelihood of this fatal condition may be reduced by eating chocolate once a week
A new study suggests that some good things might be good for the heart muscle.
What is it, and how might it reduce the chance of a heart attack?
Scientists have made a meta-analysis of coronary heart disease over five decades.
The main symptoms of coronary heart disease (also referred to as ischaemic heart disease) are three: chest pain (angina), heart attack and heart failure.
Other symptoms may include palpitations and severe shortness of breath.
“Succes contain nutrients that are good for the heart, such as flavonoids, methylxanthines, polyfenol and stearic acid, which can reduce inflammation and raise good cholesterol
Good cholesterol, also called high - density lipoprotein, collects “bad - cholesterol — a type of cholesterol that narrows the arteries of the heart — and transports it to the liver.
- The level of cholesterol (low density lipoprotein) is broken down in the liver and is then excreted from the body.
However, the new study does not examine the dose or type of chocolate that is consumed.
It is not clear whether participants ate dark chocolate, milked chocolate, or other chocolate.
The results were based on an earlier study that concluded that the intake of cocoa (found in chocolate) reduced the risk of a heart attack.
Scientists believe that flavonoid found in chocolate reduces blood pressure and improves vascular function.
By blood vessels, it means how well the blood distributes oxygen and nutrients around the body and transports waste materials.
Lifestyle factors were not considered in the results of the new study.
Regarding the evidence, Dr. Alice Lichtenstein said that those who had admitted to eating chocolate were more likely to have healthy body weight.
She added that they could exercise regularly and experience less stress.
“ any of these factors could have an independent effect on cardiovascular health,” she added.
Coles distributes plastic toys for books in a new collection profile
“We have really listened, and there was a key point in preparing the project,” said Ronson.
“We don’t believe that people want to recycle the books — we think they’ll want them, but they can get them back at home if they want to —
Ronson told us that the new campaign has been under way long before COVID-19 came into existence, and despite the traffic, she believes that the timing of the new campaign was “some good — because of how much time parents now spend with their children.
The concern has been voiced by the fact that consumers are getting tired on continuous toy - collecting campaigns of the largest supermarkets, but Ronson says there is no evidence of fatigue at present.
“ We haven’t seen anything like this yet, but we keep our eyes open about it, ” she said.
“ We report a lot of data, from week to month, to make sure that what we give in to our customers feels the same.
Cloes was the leader of collection campaigns such as Little Shop in Australia, but the first one about my year 2018 was the driving force behind the top quarter of the supermarket’s annual sales from the beginning.
Woolworth followed with Lion King Oosheis, who also helped the supermarket to increase its sales, and now the last time the environmentally friendly presentation campaign Discovery Garden offers customers a free plant and flowers for planting.
However, this time, as UBS professionals predict an increase in sales in the Australian market in the largest part of the financial year 2021, the new collection campaign could have a smaller impact.
Ronson said customers can expect a wider collection campaign in the future and that campaigns such as Little Shop are likely to be less frequent.
“ There’s a lot of mass gathering campaigns around the world that we look at, and we constantly seek inspiration from other countries — she said.
“We need to do this to make sure that we’re getting better and better with our customers —
5 rings around the country this summer
The photographer and manufacturer of the materials Jon Ragnar Jonsson, often known as Jon From Iceland, has been much more familiar with Iceland since the outbreak.
John completed a business degree at the University of Reykjavik a few years ago, but now he is working to travel and produce marketing material for individuals and companies.
The summer began early at Joni, or in April, when he traveled all over the West and stayed in his car.
For a year, he has gone about five or six circles around the country.
Besides, he's gone on countless day trips here and there.
What journey has come up from?
“ For someone like me who’s always on a raft and has seen everything, it’s hard to mention a favorite place.
The weather and association are more important.
A lot of high ground has recently gone up since the roads opened in June.
They always stand up because it's so much adventure to go to the destination.
The last trip there is the possible favorite trip of the year, when 25 of us went to five large cars up by River Side and then to River Sea -
What's ahead of you this summer?
“ I’m very excited about it next time, but I just finished a dive course with DIVE and now take diving trips here and there around Iceland.
Then I was adding surfboards to the “Dotch Sanctuary — with me so that I’ll be more in the sea than before.
I am so headed for a 10 - day “solo ” trip with everything I need, but it will be seen later in the summer where I go.
Otherwise I'm going to be a lot of high ground in the next few days, as it's not possible to look at that area all year round.
What is your favorite place in Iceland?
“ I always find it difficult to choose one place, but the Jakaul River has been part of my life ever since I remember.
My family and I went every summer to live at the foot of a Brejamark kitchen, and since then I have always felt good in that area.
I think it's safe to say that I've been there over 100 times...
With what place in Iceland do you recommend that people visit?
“ I’m going to bring one pearl from each part of the country, but it’s: a mule in the South, a rampart in the East, an Aldinaphoss in the North, a Redsea in the West, a snowflake in the West, and last but not last...
What is vital about the journey?
“ I don’t go abroad unless I have the following in my car: a good flashlight, a hammock, a lopapeys, a hunting knife, an arson, a cold box, and a toy bite... those who know me know what I’m talking about —
Seeking 24 Rohians Feared of Drunking From an Island in Malaysia
KULAL LUMPRUR, Malaysia (AP) — The Malaysian authorities said on Sunday that they were looking for 25 rooster refugees who were afraid to drown after jumping off a boat from Langkawi, a tourist island in Malaysia.
Zawawi Abdullah, senior official of the Malaysian County Council, said that the first police information showed that only one of the 25 roosters who had jumped off the boat had been able to swim to land.
The man who survived sought help from the police late on Saturday and has been held while the matter is being investigated, according to Zawawi.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslim roosters have fled Myanmar because of military operations, and many of them live in crowded refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Muslims are the majority of Malaysian residents, who have been the time of a boat’s destination, promising refugees a better life in a foreign land.
Zawawi said two ships and airships were used for the search.
He said that the landguard also remembers the local seamen and authorities in the neighbouring country of Thailand to assist them in their search.
He gave no further information about the boat.
Last month, the authorities in Malawi arrested 269 robbers in custody and found a body on a ship that was suspected of being used by smugglers from Langkawi’s shores, but they asked him to be harmed deliberately so that he could not return to sea.
Malachi’s exile later stated that the 269 individuals were taken from a larger ship with dozens of people who are thought to have died and that their bodies were thrown into the sea.
The prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, said that Malaysia could not accept any more rooster refugees as they struggle with economic problems because of the crown virus epidemic.
He said, however, that those who are already in the land would not be sent back to sea.
In Malaysia, more than 2 million illegal immigrants live in addition to some 180,000 refugees and asylum seekers — including 101,000 roosters — registered at the United Nations Refugee Organization.
People in Aswan collect, watch and return a cargo of chocolate to Sudan by car roll
The transfer car on its way to Sudan with many tons of chocolate chosen on the international road between Aswan and Abu Simple on Sunday, at the village of Wadi Karkar, when the driver died from a heat blow.
The townspeople flocked to help the driver as he lay and rescue the item that had been oared.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, described his position as “the driver was passing by our village; we couldn’t just stand by.
No matter where it comes from, we're supposed to help people in distress.
He added that villagers had arrived in an ambulance to pick up the driver and then tried to save the truck, estimated at three million pounds.
Bahr said that the villagers have been on the scene from morning to night, saving as much of their cargo as they could.
“ The most important thing we thought was to save the driver’s life, protect the cargo, and reopen the international road, ” he said.
The villagers were willing to provide the injured driver with water and shelter, said Bahr, and added that they just wanted to make sure that he would get to and from the village safe.
The Korean virus could make it worse.
“ The world epidemic alone calls for our elected representative for the leadership and vision we have in difficult times, ” says a report prepared from an interview by Leonard Steinhorn, professor of communication at American University, and Mark Sobol, author and expert in organizational development and management.
“ But we are also faced with other responsibilities involving the inherited sin of our people and the racial injustice that has plagued our country from its organization,
The study reviews familiar topics related to the pathetic status of the Congress: lack of real relations between classes, agendas that limit opportunities for communication, excessive involvement of power in leadership positions, constant financial requirements, distinctions between categories of cooperation, negative effects on the whole day-to-day media, the fact that the most important elections for the congressmen are often foreshadows and finally silenced minority groups.
It is also warned that the Congress is moving further into the Internet because of the pandemic, where such a system, which allows the election with the help of a stand in a representative department without the Congressmen having to travel to Washington, could still add to the existing problems.
If the idea of teleconference is reached, it would be a serious setback for attempts to increase inter-class communication, as the report says.
“ As a result of the global epidemic, Congress was forced to transfer most of its activities to the Internet, and we certainly understand why, ” says the report.
“ But even if there was a need for such things as virtue should not be interpreted,
The document says that the council “needs more communication, not less, between the congressmen, face to face —
They need to learn more about each other’s territory, have polite conversations to find common ground, and build a trust - based relationship that can lead to increased understanding and solutions —
The call for politeness was especially true this week when Ted Yoho, the congressman of the Repúblicans of Florida, attacked Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the congressman of the Democratic Republic of New York, and his companions agreed to attack Liz Cheney, the congressman of the Repúblicans in Wyoming with hostile words.
The congresswoman Val Demings discusses the vice president's office, letting Trump hear it for grace
The congresswoman of Val Demings (Democrats, Florida) was not shy about discussing his interest in running the vice-president’s office to the potential government of Joe Biden and expressing sincere gratitude for being taken into account for the office.
This respected member of the assembly group of blacks was interviewed by BlackPressUSA in live broadcast because of #FIYAH! The Live Party told about its history, energy and commitment that have brought her to the place she is today, and started with the words “You know all my history. I grew up as a maid and housekeeper in Jacksonville, Florida.
Demings was one of the four prosecutors in the court cases of Donald Trump in the January Senate.
Regardless of whether the Senate will indict Trump, it will be recorded in history that he is the fourth president who is charged with it.
In an interview with the NPR from his office with Capitol Hill, the former prosecutor of the council said: “Was it worth it?
She added that, despite the disappointment of the decision, they had been obliged to follow the case regardless of its outcome.
In the interview, Demings made it clear that she is opposed to Trump in Rogers Stone’s prison sentence, which was convicted of lying before the Congress (accumulating other crimes) as well as to other criminals convicted of similar crimes, saying “The indecentness of taking hold of your friends, those who have lied and cheated to cover your iniquities, ”
Deamings is at the top of Joe Biden’s list of potential Vice President candidates, who also contains Karen Bass foreman CBC (democrats, California), Stacey Abram’s former Georgian congressman, Senators Kamölu Harris (democrats, California) and Tammy Duckworth (democrats, Illinois), Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, former U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice and others.
She stated, however, that only one person would decide who will take Joe Biden in the fall.
It's Joe Biden.
Then she brought her hand to her mouth while she laughed and seemed whispering to those who watched the live broadcast, and added “If you want to call... you can do it for me, ”
There is no doubt that regardless of political views, historical books view this period as a time when American politics and attitudes developed.
It didn't go past Demings.
She pointed out that the number of women in the U.S. Vice President’s office is an opportunity to break through the remaining “golden roof ” — especially for African women.
“ It’s exactly these opportunities that I work so hard at all my life to create for young boys and girls who have heard that their color is wrong, that they don’t have enough money or that they are of the wrong sex, ” she said.
The congresswoman decided to ensure that the Democratic Party Committee and the election team Biden would advertise and work with the Black Press of America to get as many people to vote as possible.
“ I’ll call Tom Perez (President of the Democratic Party’s Committee) and I’ll put this at the top of my list, ” said Demings.
She agreed that this would have to happen now rather than later in the campaign.
When she responded to the words of former Foreign Secretary Hillary Clinton that Trump could refuse to leave the White House, he lost his vote, and another editorial that says that the president is preparing to take advantage of himself lived over Demings: “To as much as he may suggest to me, that he may have made me feel sick,
“ But who would ever do it other than Trump?
I think he hates this job.
It should not be possible to get away with breaking the law and ignoring the constitution in this work.
I think he hates the job, but he can't stand to lose.
I can absolutely believe that the president will not want to leave the White House, but we have our ways to take care of it, and if that happens, I just want to be with those who make it happen --
Pedestrian sinuses
There are opening glasses for children who want to make a toast to their parents from a young age in bottles that fit the table in better days.
No doubt there are some parents who rejoice — or those parents who have been fed up with the childish girl with the parades.
But children who reach out for their parents ’ glasses are less likely to be interested in seeing on their feet.
These round bottles we ran into on the modernhousessenials.com page, which contains a variety of gold molds.
The bottles have a good tip, a steady foot, and a good temperature--for kids can use garbage whether it's hot or cold.
Each glass has a capacity of 150 ml.
Those who want to examine the bottles more closely can look into the home page of HÉR, but the bottles are available these days at a small $3,400 (U.S.) dollar offer.

“ The legal application also includes “a list of sensitive words — that contain passwords in Hindu and English such as “India and China’s border — and the war between China and India — that are stated in the complaint that UC Web uses to study material on its systems in India, ” says Reuters.
Last month, the Ministry of Internal Affairs banned 59 Chinese mobile telephone programs, including UC News and UC Browser, as well as an increase in tension between the two countries.
A New York City Fire Department representative says that it is “all right to exclude a white fireman from the price of honor.
An agent who deals with diversity in the New York City Fire Department says it is “alienly — okay to keep a white firefighter from a price so that all flagbers can be black, according to a recent news report.
White fireman Daniel McWilliams has referred to racial discrimination after he was taken from a group of flagbers at a memorial meeting in November 2017 to commemorate the fallen members of the Vulcan community, which is the brotherhood of black firefighters.
In addition, the decision in the New York Post hearing about the human rights department of the New York State was defended by the chief representative of the fire department in the field of diversity and accessibility, lawyer Cecilia Loveing.
McWilliams is one of the three firefighters in the department who are seen in a historic image lifting the American flag at Ground Zero in the day after the 9/11 attacks.
According to McWilliam’s complaint, the fire department had chosen him to be alone with the flagbearers at the memorial service.
Being a flagbearer at this ceremony was “a great honor and privilege — for McWilliam, according to the CNN.
When he arrived at the ceremony, however, he was refused to take part in the honorary service of the then President of the Vulcan Society, Regina Wilson, for it is claimed that she had asked all the flag bearers of the Mass to be black.
She then asked McWilliams — a 29-year-old fireman of New York City — to help in another way —
Among the things that are claimed to have asked him to do is to accompany the civilian community and set up a uniform firemen away from the mess.
McWilliam's claim in his trial that he asked Wilson if she was taking him out of the honorary, because he wasn't black.
She confirmed that it was so, he said.
Wilson, who has worked with the fire department New York City for 21 years and who also participated in the rescue work on 11 September, will have replaced McWilliam with one of the Vulcans.
McWilliams claims that he abandoned the memorial ceremony “to spare himself of further shame, humiliation, and shame, ” says the New York Daily News.
When a black man named Love was in court, McWilliam’s lawyer, Keith Sullivan, asked: “The fact that praying for all of us to be black on a price is not a difference —
“ No, it’s not, ” said the New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Loved if it would be all right to ask that everyone be black on a price, which she answered: “Absolutely —
Loved explained that it was okay to replace a white person with a black person in order “to raise our special standing and different origins to create pride, unity and support for one another —
McWilliams first referred for discrimination on the basis of race in the fire department of New York City in January 2018.
He then appealed against Wilson, fired New York City, New York City, and unnamed individuals in May 2019.
Sullivan said that after McWilliam's actions, Wilson had his supporters avenged him and threatened him.
At one point, one of her supporters will have laid hands on McWilliams, saying: “I’ve heard of you, they told me you would behave like this, and now you know who I am —
In the extraction, Sullivan wrote that it had been “disgusting — to exclude McWilliam from the honorary service at the Mass and to show that one thing would not work out for everyone in the fire department.
“ If you’re a black person and you’re different from a white person in the workplace, you’ll be reminded at most, ” said Sullivan.
Wilson, according to the law, was given “a one - hour counselor for her treatment of McWilliam.
Meanwhile, a white person who discriminates against a black person “mighty punishment ” wrote Sullivan.
“The New York City Blackvil has created a policy and process to please members of the Vulcan community who behave in a racist way, excuse their actions and help them... and this needs to stop, ” said Sullivan.

Thousands of Khabarovsk people still demand Putin's resignation
Thousands of people joined the Russian town of Khabarovsk yesterday and protested the arrest of the governor of the provinces in the provinces, who had never resided in the East Russia and his successor, who never lived in the region.
The former governor, Sergei Furgal, is a popular man, and dozens of thousands protested when he was arrested and placed in custody in Moscow earlier this month, accused of having ordered murder in three merchants 15 years ago.
During the past week, Furgal was formally set off as governor and his 39-year-old class brother, Mikhail Degtyarev, appointed in his place, with little love for the locals.
Is Degtaryev said inexperienced and, worse, without any connection to Khabarovsk and called the citizens after his resignation the immediate.
They've called Degtaryev a twilight.
The protesters yesterday were small fewer than in the first protests, or fifteen to twenty thousand, and the demands were the same as before: the salvation of Furgal and the resignation of Vladimir Putin, president of Russia.
“We want the governor to be released, because we believe that his arrests are very likely to be illegal,” says AFP report from a half-tributary Protestant, Alina Slepova.
She claims that the Kremlin agents had Furgal arrested “to protect their own interests, but not the interests of the province —
The police in Khabarovsk left the Protestants unenforced despite the unswerving violation of the current Kórona virus ban.
In Moscow, however, the police arrested at least ten people who met in Pushkin Square to show Protestant support in action, says the British newspaper Guardian.
Furgal's class, Russia's Freedom Party of Democracy, is a group of hard-line nationalists, and is thought by political commentators to be somewhat loyal to the Kremlin government in most cases.
However, the same political commentators informed the BBC that the victory of Furgal in the governors of the provinces two years ago — a great and distasteful one — had been a considerable shock for Putin and the United Russia, and although it indicates that the Kremlins in the East were getting sick.
Furgal was arrested on July 9, and moved to Moscow, where he awaits trial.
He is charged with ordering three murders in 2004 and 2005.
Two of them were past, and the third went out of the pit.
Sarah Rainsford, the BBC newswriter in Moscow, says that Furgal’s followers, who enjoy popular homes, convinced that the charge and the arrest are politically rooted.
They want to know why governments have waited until now for him to be arrested, says Rainsford, 15 years after his supposed offense.

Homeless women with disabilities are involved in the fight against COVID-19 in Chennai
Shanthi, a disabled woman who is trained as a tailor, visits 250 homes every day to identify people with symptoms in the Kodam bank, a large covid area in Chennai, where there have been about 10,000 cases.
Workday starts early at 7:30, and ends at 4:00.
It measures the heat in the population, asks for symptoms, and teaches them the importance of using masks, washing their hands regularly, and keeping away from others.
Its work has even led to the detection and treatment of infection at the time of four positive individuals.
Shanthi is one of 16,000 Chennai employees who do their homework but are not health professionals.
According to the government, the project has contributed to a 50 - percent decrease in positive cases, in Chennai’s daily count, as they increase in other Tamil Nadu provinces.
Shanthi says that not all residents cooperate.
She adds: “Most people cooperate when a disabled woman approaches them.
Some, though, get irritated.
This, though, is not to worry about.
I think people should be safe.
When I come back the next day, people will be courteous.
Building a good relationship helps
And there are more women like Shanthi who stay in the gistyl of the city for women with disabilities and fight Covid-19.
Not far from Kodambakkam, Kavitha, who is also disabled, has also been involved in the campaign as an overseer.
Although Kavith owns a special bicycle, she goes on to meet people and holds her hedges.
“ I’m happy, ” she says about a reduction in infection, but she adds: “I want to see them go down to maybe about 100 a day.
I'm sure we can do it.
On the first floor of the guitary where the two living are Matilda Funceca, a basketball woman who uses a wheelchair, and Manimekalai, a teacher, and they send all the data that comes from about 40 women into Chennai's web server.
Matilda says she doesn't fear being infected by the crown virus.
“ When we help others, God protects us, ” she adds.
When asked what action she will take, Manimekalai says: “I use a mask, keep away, and wash my hands often.
I also drink Kabasura Kudineer, a Siddha drink that stimulates the immune system.
A few months ago, when the crown virus first arrived in Chennai, these disabled women devoted their time and abilities to suing masks for health professionals in the city.
Aishwarya Rao, a professor and director of the Gistylia, as well as Dorcas, who operates a cloud force, says: “They adapt to the needs of every moment.
A mask was missing before, and they did not leave behind.
Now there's been an intervention in the community, and then they answered the call,
In Tamil Nadu, while the number of infections diagnosed in one day is now 200,000 after 6989, according to official data, there is also the highest number of transmissions detected in one day.
Eighty-nine have died, and 7758 have recovered within 24 hours.
The total number of infections in the state is now 206,737.

South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox report their experience of discrimination
The last few weeks have seen that many skeletons are still in the closet in connection with racial discrimination in sports in South Africa.
Building conversations need to take place and take action so that everyone is welcome in sports.
Ashwell Prince, former Proteas’s crippled star, made his former white teammates hear it and accused them of racial prejudice by telling him and other black teams to be “female players ”
Prince said that black proteas players have been publicly named “female players — by their white teammates.
He added that it was sad that even though black players like Makhaya Ntini and now Kingso Rabada reached the top levels of the sport, some people still connected with the quota talk.
Prince, who is now the trainer of the Cape Cobras team, made these comments appear at the United Coalition for Sport and Community Based Organisations (UCSCBO) website on Thursday evening.
The goal of the cooperation is to continue to focus on the most ancient racial discrimination in South Africa.

Paul Roberts, a former musician and engineer who became a programmer at NASA, now works with a software company.
He and his wife, a former nurse at the Methodist Hospital, who thinks he was an optimist, kept out an amateur magazine online and attended a Comic Con event earlier in years.
Once a week, they flush with their two daughters, their son-in-law and a 7-year-old grandchild and play a violent Uno game.
“ They are amazing nerds, ” says 38 - year - old Roman about his parents.
Sheryl Roberts, aged 65, is aware of the dangers of a pandemic — diabetes, asthma, and heart disease that can put her at increased risk.
Her husband has a chronic lung disease and a stent that previously holds an open coronary artery.
“We’ve been so careful, very careful, and staying away from people, ” said Sheryl Roberts.
Her husband began to work from home in the spring, when the travel fought hard in Washington, New York and other areas around the country.
Paul has gone to a great deal of “old times, ” and their only real date for the past month was, according to Sheryl, when they began to look at wildflowers through the car window.
Their younger daughter was also cautious.
Then she came home from work one day in mid - June and felt that she was allergic.
Soon she developed cough, fever, headache, and diarrhoea, and lost all sense of taste and smell, which is a typical symptom of the crown virus.
“ She said: “I don’t know what’s going on, Mom, but I was wearing a mask, wearing gloves, washing my hands, ” said Sheryl.
“ You’re doing everything right, but you’re getting infected anyway —
Elaine Roberts, diagnosed with a positive CPR, did not become seriously ill.
However, her parents made things worse.
Paul Roberts and his wife began to sneeze and then cough, just like their daughter, and got so hot and much pain in their body.
Then, “exactly ill, modestly quickly, ” said Sheryl Roberts.
On June 22, he became confused.
Concerned, she checked his oxygen level.
It was low, and she asked their older daughter to take him to an emergency room for the second time in two days.
The former royal couple thought it was “shen — in the Queen’s Christmas speech, according to a new book
MEGHAN Markle and Harry Breta Prince found his grandmother, a British queen, “meet them in their Christmas speech.
The couple’s recent life story, “Finding Freedom, ” shows that they were viewed by those in the gallery who could see the Christmas talk.
Pictures on the desk at the queen’s table showed, among other things, the visions of Prince Will of the British, Kate Middleton, and the three children of the three, Karl the British Prince, and his wife Kamilla, as well as Prince Philip.
However, in May, in spite of Archie’s birth, Meghan and Harry were not seen, yet the boy was referred to as “the mighty grandchildren — her Majesty.
The new August book also notes that Meghan and Kate Middleton “were never friends, since they“ had difficulty getting across superficial courtesy — and met only a few times.
Yesterday, it was claimed that Harry and his brother Willhelm’s differences began some years before his relationship with Meghan and his marriage to William and Kate Middleton.
The Duke of Sussex felt that he was “a fool — an event with his brother and Kate Middleton, and that“ he wanted to change things long before Meghan came to life, ”
The members of the team accuse labor leaders of wanting to keep public employees “forever ”
Team members accuse labor leaders of wanting official workers to “go home forever — after the leaders protested Boris Johnson that people would return to work.
Workers were accused of wanting workers to “speak at home forever — after they objected to Boris Johnson’s request to return to work.
The team members were angry when the union of public and public employees told their companions to kick their feet when their superiors ordered them to return to their workplaces.
Andrew Percy, former minister, said that “unacceptable — the need for public service, such as a passport, to be stopped while public - market workers have worked hard to keep society going during the crown virus epidemic.
“ It is unacceptable for people to refuse to return to their jobs while workers in warehouses and factories all over the country have continued to work so that public employees could eat during this time, ” he said.
“ Many of these employees now want to go on summer vacation, but they cannot because of the people who refuse to go back to their places of work, although they are safe.
Workers cannot maintain this policy of staying at home forever — especially now that we know people can safely return to work —
Following the call by the Prime Minister last week, Alex Chisholm, the newly appointed director of public service, announced that the Ministry would “return from home to work in public service, and speed up their return to their workplaces until August 1,“
The civil society of public and public employees told its members, some 200,000 people, that they did not have to comply with this requirement, and that this was a matter of politics.
A public and public union official, the largest union of public employees in Britain, said that the need to return to the workplace was “not presented with the health and safety of our fellow workers in the first place, or to strengthen the economy.
This is done only because of political pressure from the Assembly members of the Team, who demand that public service be used as an example to get others back to work.
Our advice to fellow workers is clear: If you do your job at home, and someone in your department asks you to return to the workplace, do not take it, of course, that you need to do so —
The issue is due to growing dissatisfaction with delayed passports because staff work at home, but some 400,000 people are now being told to wait for the outcome of their applications.
The Ministry of Home Affairs has now announced that it will “be looking to speed up — applications from the British for travel in the next two weeks, and from those who have waited for a passport for more than four weeks.
While admitting that some had to wait up to 143 days for passports, public and public workers’ unions have claimed that “small and often narrow offices — making it difficult for 4,000 staff to keep away the necessary distances.
The former minister of the government, David Davis, encouraged union leaders to “work wisely — seeking ways to cooperate with governments to get people back into their workplaces.
He added that if he was in government, he would ask a labor leader: “What do you want?
However, many of Britain’s largest companies have also ignored Johnson’s recommendation to return to work.
A study of larger workplaces with a total of about 400,000 employees found that only about 40,000 of them have returned to their workplaces.
The emphasis on history can play an important role in reconciliation
It has broadened, but understanding and reconciliation should be the goal.
The school system is part of the blame for this lack of knowledge and understanding.
Too little is taught by an Australian history.
The fact is that without any radical action, the only subject specifically related to our history will die out within the next five years or even earlier.
Last year, in Victoria, only 628 students completed a study in Australia’s history of 49,324 who completed a primary school course, or just 1%.
Over the past six years, this figure has narrowed by almost half, but nearly 100 fewer students are enrolled in the profession each year.
The main reason why so few students choose to learn about Australia’s 12th grade history is that little has been done in previous years of study to interest them.
History is not even a unique field of study, but it falls under the broader “discreet ”
Therefore, students in the 7th and 8th classes complete only one brief unity about “the natives and the island regions of Torres and their culture, ”
During World Wars 9, 10, there is another unit in Australia.
For many students in Victoria, this is all that is taught about Australia’s elementary history.
In years 9 and 10, there is another optional unit for the period 1750-1918.
It is urgent that three measures be taken to save Australian history in Victoria’s schools.
First, history must become an independent study article, such as English, mathematics, and science.
Since a story is taught only as part of thinking, it has little space in the curriculum.
It is usually taught by people who have a general education in the field of intellectual science but have not learned history.
Historical skills such as data analysis are complex.
We must employ more specialized historians to ensure that such skills are trained in an accessible and exciting manner.
Third, Australia’s history, from 1788 to 1914, will become an obligation.
Students appreciate what they know.
So many of my former students chose not to learn Australia’s history in the 12th year of study because they would have had to learn the material from scratch.
Knowledge of history alone does not reveal deep racial differences.
But without it, as clearly indicated in the Victorian study program, the assignment is hopeless.
Dr. Matthew Bach is the congressman of the state of Victoria and former assistant school director Ivanhoe Girls' Grammar.
Aaron Elis at the final game of Europe - Isaac’s half-way course
Aaron Elis Drendarson is in the final game of European dining in the Dane Selection Department of Football.
Isaac Bergmann Johannesson played only the first half with the top Norrköping against the bottom of Falkenberg, Sweden.
Aaron Elis was a member of the OB in Denmark when the team continued to play a final game in the European Union Championship.
OB will meet AGF or FC Köbenhavn at the playoffs, which depends on whether the joints will end up above the end of the senior part of the Danish Selection Board later today.
Aaron Elis played the whole game in a 1-1 draw at Horsens on the outskirts today, while the OB had played the first game of the teams at home, 3-1, and thus won a total of 4-2.
Isaac was at the beginning of the Norrköping team, which was unexpectedly 2 - 0 below after the first half-game against Falkenberg's bottomman in the Swedish Selection Department.
In the beginning of the second half, a three - time division made a novation, and Isaac was one of those who needed to be replaced.
Norrköping reached an equal rate, while Falkenberg reached 3-2 at 89 minutes.
However, it was still time for Norrköping to level out of hell at the last minute, 3 - 3.
Norrköping is still on top, with 24 points, four points ahead of Elfsborg and five points ahead of Malmö, which is playing well later today.
The ladder was sufficient to get off the bottom for now, but the team is stepped above Helsingborg and Kalmar, who owns a game for good.
Collected Records of the National Festival in the Crown Virus Times
Anna Lilja Fordsunda founded the Facebook group “My National Festival 2020 — to gather records of the festival that the Americans will hold for the next weekend.
Many plan to camp in their pastures and rejoice with friends and relatives.
Anna Lilja had a conversation with Antsa in the Helgen section of the Bridge.
“There’s nothing yet that’s very exciting, too, because there’s 600 people in the group, so people are clearly going to do something,” says Anna Lilja.
Something is happening that the islanders are going to have tent parties at home.
“ Men have talked about being with their own [festival], perhaps camping in the park and hosing up the family as they always do at this time, ” says Anna.
“ You expect people to spend time with their people.
However, it is likely that many people will simply not be there “but to celebrate some small festival somewhere else —
The National Committee is now working hard to pay back the tickets that were bought, but Anna believes that many locals would rather secure tickets for the next year’s festival.
“ Men are even investing in the tickets now and making a value for 2021 —
“ I am a great German man, I love the preparation and all about it, but sometimes something comes into life that you don’t control, and then it’s just like that, ” says Anna, but according to her report, people ask whether the Ethiopians can’t let go of a national festival “one of them, ” she says.
Anna Lilja says that she did not set up the group for herself or encourage people to celebrate their own festivals, but to gather records of World Traders ’ holidays in the island of that year.
“ What did people do in these strange times?
I'm not going to use this in one thing or another, but I'm going to happen to someone who's using such a source in something, but I was just creating some area where people can put in what they're doing --
At the same time, a fire has been uploaded every year on the Violet.
“ I think a lot of people are excited about getting burned on Friday night.
The only thing that makes sense in the account, of course, is that the prediction is nothing specific —
“ This burning will be lit, but it must only be revealed how it will be,” says Anna Lilja.
The interview with Anna Lilja can be heard in the player below.
Will Prince André be mentioned in new records about sexual abuse?
The British royal family is now preparing to respond to possible new information in court about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.
U.S. Judge has ordered that secret documents about Epstein and Maxwell be made public
Among the pages found in these 80 pages are parts of Maxwell’s 2016 witness work.
These recent events could also put great pressure on Prince André, where they contain communications between Maxwell and Epstein since January 2015
Virginia Roberts, the alleged sex slave of the disgraced American financier, claimed in 2015 in court that she had been forced to have a conversation with Prince Andrew.
Prince Andrés is now preparing to defend himself against the possible publication of information this week with even more harmful accusations about his friendship with child molester Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged colleague, Ghislaine Maxwell.
In the week, U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska appointed 80 secret legal documents in connection with Maxwell and Epstein, which count hundreds of pages.
The provision of these huge documents would be a shock to the 58 - year - old Maxwell, where they have much to store with her testimony before lawyers in 2016, including what her lawyers have said to be “exciting questions — about her sex story.
They could also put great pressure on Prince André, where one of the documents contains communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts, supposed to be the sex slave of the disgraced American financier, claimed in 2015 that she had been forced three times to consult Andrew.
Andrew has repeatedly rejected these claims.
A 2015 e-mail that has been leaked and the BBC published last year seems to indicate that Andrés has asked Maxwell for help in responding to Robert’s claims.
We have no doubt that the Duke will rise up in rebellion.
There he said to the head of the classwoman: “Please let me know when we can talk, and there are some questions I need to ask you about Virginia Roberts —
Maxwell replied: “Do you have information?
Last night, a source close to Andrew said: “The duke of Jórvik has done nothing wrong, so we are not worried about the opening of a court case.
As the courts of the United States have tried to point out, this does not mean that an accusation is true when it is brought to justice.
The U.S. courts have encouraged the media and the public to take full care of the charges in court.
We're totally in agreement with that.
We have no doubt that the duke will be in full rebellion in the next few weeks --
Maxwell is now in custody at the Manhattan detention center, awaiting trial for finding and seizing some of Epstein’s victims who were under legal age from 1994 to 1997.
It is also accused of injuring itself of refusing knowledge during a report on his abuse.
She rejects all charges.
Maxwell last spoke to lawyers in April and July 2016 in connection with Robert’s horticulture, now under the last name Giufre, which she noted as a marriage.
About 40 pages out of 418 of that witness were made public last year, but after the decision of New York City’s judge, New York, more parts could be opened on Thursday.
Lawyers Maxwell received one week to file an appeal.
Epstein was found dead in his cell in New York last year when he was tried for sexual abuse.
Investigators are looking for gangs for violent attacks on the streets of Edinburgh
Three assaulted a man in Edinburgh, and he suffered a potential trauma.
The 29 - year - old victim was attacked at Drum Street, Gilmerton, between 11:00 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The Scottish police reported that he had been transferred to the royal hospital with serious injury.
“ This was a violent and pointless attack, ” said investigator Dale Miles, who runs the study.
Suspects fled to Newton Street.
One was thought to be in his 30 ’ s, about six feet [180 cm] in height, and a strong one.
He was short - cut and dark - haired in a white shirt, dark pants, and dark shoes.
A police officer named Miles said: “I ask everyone in this area when the attack was made and saw something suspicious about surrendering —
The ambassador wants to carry a gun to Iceland
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, ambassador of the United States in Iceland, wants to carry a gun on this country and want to increase security.
He has been said to have been “a manly person ” about his safety since his arrival last year.
This is stated in CBS’ report, which also says that Gunter, despite his work in “one of the safest states in the world, ”
Gunter is said to have asked the U.S. State Department to ask for a gun to be carried by the Icelandic government.
Then he has asked for a armored car and a vest that protects him from knife stabs.
CBS’ sources say that the Ministry has repeatedly informed Gunter that he is not at risk in Iceland.
According to CBS, Iceland’s State Department of Foreign Affairs has not provided any information as to whether a request from the United States regarding the potential arms incident with Gunter was received, because the authorities do not express themselves about foreign military security measures.
However, sources say that no request has been made.
Then, too, after his sources have been told that he should not seek arms, therefore, it would be an insult on this land.
Gunter has been a dermatologist for years in California.
He's a member of the United States Republican Party, and he's a noble supporter of Mr. Donald Trump, President.
He recently drew attention to this land when he was ticking about the “invisible China virus —
CBS’ sources also say that Gunter significantly reduced the staff of the U.S. embassy in Reykjavik.
He already had seven secondhand staff in the embassy from May of last year.
Among other things, he accused them of belonging to “the kingdom of the deep, ” called the Internet of U.S. officials who work against Trump, and responded with anger that one man carried snow into his office.
The ambassador traveled to Washington DC in February for a convention and refused to return to Iceland for a few months, according to CBS’ sources.
Gunter is said to have wanted to work from California, but eventually Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, had to order him to return and do so in May.
The form of the home game is a key point for Jose Mourinho, who says Tottenham has easier games to play when the fans get to come back at play
With Jose Mourinho’s help, Tottenham Hotspur has not lost a game at home since the selection department started again, but he says that it would be much easier to keep a good walk at home if the audience were allowed to play.
Spurs has won 12 wins at home during this season, but he lost four times — only one of the six above have lost more on the home field.
The Portuguese coach said that even if such winnings were possible without the adherents, it would be easier to maintain them if they were there.
“We have to do this with the fans, and without them we can build some kind of fortress, where the program is in a foreground, ” he said.
“But I think that much more powerful is to do so with the fans, because then the emotional side of the game, which is just next to the fans at the home stadium —
Mourinho believes that with stronger competitors, it will be increasingly difficult to maintain the long - term home seasons that he knows from Chelsea, or that Liverpool has built up the past three seasons.
But this is also a key factor in determining whether or not their goals are achieved at the end of the season, especially in equal games and neighbouring laws, since the atmosphere on the field can make a difference.
“I think the policy of the Selection Department is now becoming increasingly difficult to beat, because of what has become good —
“ On the other hand, it’s important to be strong at home, and at the end of the season, you’ve made a number of points with wins at home —
“ I’m happy with the finals of home games lately, without the fans, but we need them back.
I picture victory against Arsenal with the field full of Tottenham fans.
It is compassion built up gradually —
Buyers excited about the pursuit of life style at Lovely Banks
“More importantly, the new owners of huge properties in the neighbourhood Lovely Banks, recently sold at $1,270, is clearly the motto.
Interesting merchants in search of a life - style property near Geelong City City were moved to look at this 1.35 hectares of land, where 14 cars can be found in garages, a pool of swimming pools and a view of Corio Bay.
Joe Grigic, a real estate dealer in Harcourts, North-geelong, said that an offer in the land that Cuddy Court 1 had been approved within 10 days of its placing on the market.
Broome Cottage in Ocean Grove back to sale
Home custom for isolation
“ We got a lot of offers from various parties, ” said Grigic.
“The property was sold to a home man who is very excited...
The property is accompanied by four two - story houses, which include a special bathroom large enough to accommodate a sofa.
The new owners have a choice of three rooms, and they can use their kitchens and have an up - to - date view of the pool.
“This was in the way the property was composed, that it was three acres, and that it was at this place,” said Grigic.
“ Here came interested merchants from Melbourne who wondered what the property was in the middle but still in the country.
“ I have people who are missing and merchants who are still looking —
He said that the spacious storage area, which includes a double garage and an open - air garage that accommodates 10 to 12 vehicles, was perfect for industrialists or to store trailer and trams.
Counting Their Security Threatened in Iceland
“Despite being appointed to the most secure country in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been paranoid about his safety since he arrived in Reykjavík last year —
This is how CBS News discusses the U.S. ambassadors in Iceland, which mimics the many sources of CBS from the U.S. foreign service.
In CBS’s discussion, Gunter claims to have requested to the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs that he would be given special permission by the Icelandic government to carry firearms.
Then, too, he should have wanted a armored car, as well as ideas about a vest that could protect him from a knife attack.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs refused to state publicly whether Gunter’s safety is really threatened in Iceland, but according to information provided by officials, Gunter has been repeatedly expressed as being in no special danger.
Despite this, the U.S. embassy recently announced full - time bodyguards in Iceland, including the July 18th morning magazine, but CBS’s sources say that it is done to calm down Gunter’s anxiety.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs does not express its concern about the safety of security operations in connection with its embassy, but it always states the objective of ensuring safety in a preventive manner.
The Ministry of Justice does not answer questions about Gunter’s request that weapons be built and the Icelandic Foreign Office does not wish to determine whether the United States formally requested the delivery of firearms by the ambassador, and says that it usually does not express itself on the security of foreign agencies.
CBS, however, has left its readers that no request was made, and according to three U.S. officials, Gunter was given out of these plans, where they could cause domestic offense in Iceland.
CBS also discusses the various problems that have been addressed by the American Embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed ambassador last year, but he will already have replaced his vice - president seven times.
In this way, the First Deputy Minister is said to have been preparing for his work for a long time and learning Icelandic only to have been denied the position at the last minute because Gunter “does not read on him — at their first meeting.
His successors have not done much better under Gunter's command.
Government officials in the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs are said to be aware of the position of the embassy in Iceland, but they are reluctant to intervene in matters closely related to the President.
In addition to all of this, Gunter is said to be reluctant to comply with the various rules of the foreign service and to respect the order of authority.
Gunter went to the United States in February to participate in a Washington conference, and it has been said to have refused to return to Iceland afterwards and left his temporary place for months, and this in the middle of a pandemic.
Mun Gunter has even wanted to do his job in work abroad and said that he would not return to Iceland unless the foreign minister, Mike Pompeo, asked for it in particular.
According to information from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs, Gunter had decided to take a personal leave of the conference and the crown virus epidemic delayed for him even further, but according to CBS' sources, many within the Council will have asked Gunter to return to Iceland, but he did not until May, after Pompeo contacted him and asked him to return to the embassy in Iceland.
CBS also discusses the enemies of Gunter in Iceland, especially in connection with the ticking, where he calls the crown virus “invisible China virus — and has become highly critical.
Gunter is one of the many, almost inexperienced in the field of foreign service, an ambassador appointed during Donald Trump's reign.
Sachin Pilot v. Ashok Gehlot; The Bharatiya Janata Party says the State’s government crisis; the Congress Group wants a vote
Ashok Gehlot said that if this happened, the Congress Party would have to provide a seat protest outside the home of the prime minister.
On Saturday, a day after a peaceful protest against Raj Bhawan, Jaipur, Ashok Gehlot, Prime Minister of Rajasthan, said that if this happened, Congress Party officials would have to meet with the president and conduct for a seat protest outside the home of the prime minister to bring the rice into the state to smell.
At the Congress Committee meeting, Gehlot suggested that a vote would be held to determine whether the majority of the Congressmen and joint forces were present in the power struggle.
“ He said the government has a majority and wants to take a vote, ” says Mahesh Joshi, head of the Congress Party, after the meeting.
The Assembly meeting was held at a hotel where the Ghelot - supported congressmen have remained in their homes for the last few days.
“ The Minister asked us to be prepared to stay at the hotel for longer.
If necessary, he said, he would meet the president and also hold peaceful protests outside the home of the prime minister — a party leader said.
The Prime Minister of Rajasthan can call the Congress and have the Congress party present to the majority of his party, said the leader Rahull Gandhi on Friday, and indicated that he had taken up the council of the Bharataya Janata party to overthrow the government of Ashok Gehlot.
“ The country is now governed by law and constitution.
Governments are formed and are working with the people’s representatives.
The plot of Bharatiya Janata has been made to overthrow Rajasthan’s government.
This is an insult to 80 million people in Rajasthan.
The prime minister must gather the council to get the truth ahead of the country, “said Gandhi in a popular fashion.
On Saturday, Mr. Ashok Gehlot, Prime Minister of Rajasthan, told Congressers that he was prepared to attend the meeting of the President of India to ensure that what he called “Bharataya Janata’s plot to delay a declaration of confidence by a vote will not succeed.
Gehlot, who protested for many hours with the home of Governor Kalrai Mishra on Friday to press a conference meeting, met with Congress Group and Government members on Saturday and after the meeting were new proposals made and approved by the government.
Mishra asked Gehlot last night to put the congressional request back in and referred to six objections.
The warrant will soon be sent to the governor.
Gehlot has accused the governor of delaying the conference where he is “under pressure — to slow down the motion for a resolution, which determines his confidence in his government.
When Gehlot met with his government, the Bharatiya Janata delegation, led by the leader of Satish Poonia and the leader of the government opposition to Gulab Chandra Kataria, met with the governor to discuss the position of the COVID-19 in the state.

The actress Spencer Grammer made a ditch outside the restaurant in Manhattan
NEW YORK — The actress Spencer Grammer said he was trying to calm down the angry man when he cut her arm and stabbed her friend in the back outside a restaurant in New York City last Friday.
Grim, who is 36, told the U.S. Weekly that she and her friend had done what everyone else had done in the same situation as they had been trying to keep things from getting worse when they were attacked.

On Friday, when a man went up to them, and demanded to receive a check, the restaurant was closed.
Grim and her friend were hurt when they tried “to resolve a difference between an unknown man and other local visitors, ” according to the police.
After hurting the right arm of Gram, the man ran away and stabbed her friend in the back with an unknown tippocket, the police said.

Grim said that both she and her friend expected to recover quickly.
Neither of them suffered serious internal injury, she said.
In a statement to U.S. Weekly, Grim thanked those who responded to the scene and the employees of the Bellevue Hospital who welcomed them and mentioned “an incredible struggle — this staff to the crown virus epidemic.

\"I don't want to be like McGregor and show my money...
I'm here to help people - - Chimaev after a historic night at UFC Fight Island - RT Sports News
Khamzat Chimaev of Russia is now referred to as the next star UFC after joining the story on Fight Island, but he says that he does not aim to flag his wealth in a profanity like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev carried Northern Irish Colonel Rhys McKee in their battle in a masquerade in Abu Dabi on Saturday night as he won his rival when three minutes and 9 seconds were over the first cycle by having the hit hit on him in the floor.
The victory recorded the name of Chimaev in the UFC history book for the shortest time between the victory in the modern history of the competition, where only 10 days had passed since he won the British John Phillips in a similar decisive way, then in an interim fashion.
Chimaev, with the 8-0, win-rate ratio, received 50,000 Allerica Valley bonus for tonight’s performance against McKee and has captured the attention of the MMA world so fully that he is now referred to as “Khalib 2.0”, which can be said to be an inevitable comparison because of the great odds between Chimaev’s superiority and the UFC Master’s in mild failure and where he is born in Teténia, which is near home-high Khabib in Dagestan.
Despite recent fame and financial gain, the translator Chimaev has said that he would not be inclined to flag his fortune like the MMA money machine Conor McGregor or his peer in boxworld, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
“ I don’t just do this for me, I do this for everyone I can help.
“ I don’t want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, showing my money or something like that.
I want to help people, — answered Chimaev when he was asked to do so on Fight Island how he would use the bonus.
He has, among other things, noticed Conor McGregor’s teammates and active Twitter-notance Dillon Danis, who wrote on the social media that he could “easyly — defeat Chimaev by surrendering.
It was not in a poisonous response from the battleship named “Borz — or “A wolf ” — in his mother tongue of Czech, who said that he would“ paint Danis with his eyes closed ”
Chimaev, now living in Stockholm, Sweden, after moving to 19 years of age, may not allow himself to be taken for his financial power, but he is clearly reluctant to play his fighting skills.

The Israelites continue to protest the reaction of the prime minister to the pandemic
JERUSALEM (AP) — Thousands of Israelis protested against the prime minister of foreign lands on Saturday and were the largest protests outside the official residence of Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
The protests have lasted for a few weeks, but they began because of what critics believe the government’s neglect to respond to the crowning virus epidemic after starting the threat of the virus.

50 people in Mosque at the Eid Festival and no prayer meetings in Eidgah, saying the government of Karnatak
The festival of Eid-ul-Azha, or Bakrid, will take place on 31 July and 1 August.
The authorities of Karnataka have announced that only 50 may meet in Mosque for Eid-ul-Azha, and have banned prayer sessions in Eidgah and other places for the crown virus epidemic.

The American Ambassador wants an armed bodyguard
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, ambassador to the United States in Iceland, believes that his life is threatened in the country and wants to carry a weapon.
At the beginning of 2020, the U.S. embassy repeatedly advertised “bodyguard ” in Icelandic newspapers and actually used the English word bodyguard in the advertisement.
According to Skøg’s sources, the main reason why these jobs were announced is that Ambassador Jeffrey Ross Gunter believes his life in Iceland is threatened.
A person who has spoken to a source in Iceland and abroad who has convinced the ambassador that he is in great danger, and the reason for this is that he is of Jewish origin.
The threat is not as clear, but the respondents said that Islamic terrorists had been mentioned as a threat.
The CBS TV station discussed the matter on its website this morning, and according to Washington’s sources, Gunter is a victim of persecution, insisting on carrying his own weapons, getting a stick - helmeted vest and armed escort along with a bullet -proof vehicle.
According to CBS’ sources, Gunter has repeatedly been said that there is no threat and that the post - bodyguard ad is only to say Gunter.
According to Skøgs’ sources, the posts were not hired by the end of June, but the application period went into February.
According to the U.S. embassy records, due to these changes, no formal matter has been received.
No formal request has been made for increased custody or for permission to have the bodyguards armed outside the embassy walls.
The Icelandic law determines that such a thing is not allowed unless it is authorised by a special authority from the Governor of the State.
The authorities say that there is no information available about any kind of threat.
The state Commissioner’s recent risk assessment is quite decisive in the field of terrorism.
There are no examples of terrorism in Iceland and no evidence that terrorist or extreme groups work here.
The reasons for granting the armaments of a foreign embassy on the streets of cities and towns in Iceland are, according to the sources of Fire, not available.
Gunter drew considerable attention to this country when he shared the first president of the United States and called the COVID-19 “China Virus —
He then carried the American and Icelandic flags with him.
In Seattle, a radio reporter who boasted that Trump's response to protests now says he needs to get a gun after Starbucks-house below his apartment was destroyed - RT United States News
Paul Gallant has got a new perspective on violent protests after hesitating Donald Trump President of the United States in June for saying that the Anarchists were burning and robbing Seattle City.
The only thing that had to be let go near the party manager's home.
“ I feel like I need to buy a gun because this will clearly continue to happen, ” said Gallant on Twitter on Saturday night after seeing that the wreckers had “destroyed the Starbucks café on his lowest floor of the apartment house.
“That’s enough, it looks like a street party down the street from me.
The situation was quite different when Trump complained of last month that the mayor of Seattle was allowing violent Protestants to take over the city.
“These liberal Democrats are stark, ” said the president.
“ They burn and rob our cities, and they just feel wonderful, even death,
Gallant, co - manager of the “Dany & Gallant” program at ESPN, Seattle, replied with a tithe: “Go to last night’s curiosity and didn’t see either burn, robbery, or death.
Gallant said last night that the police had advised residents to stay away from his apartment building where explosives might be found in the damaged Starbucks café.
He published pictures of the damage and said: “Well done, you idiots, ” and stated that he had also seen fire a few blocks away.
“Don’t know what’s going on, but we’re going to find out.
The conversion did not go past people who ridiculed Gallant for his earlier opinion, and his last messages such as “Just relax the salmon, — and “Yah, maybe Trump was right” —
Jason Rantz, second radio in Seattle, said: “If we're not going on this tour we discussed at last...
Gallant went to the joke: “Whether a lot of people were ticking, ‘ relax on salmon — to me. I laughed —
He said he stood by his previous statement as he had gone through the CHAZ self-control area of an anarchost and although it was not as bad as it had been done as.
“ So they were burned and robbed after all, ” he said.

Countes too early to claim another wave in this country
An expert in the field of health care at the surgeon’s office says that it is too early to claim another wave of the epidemic.
Three new domestic infections were detected in the Landspitlan virology division yesterday, with dozens of people in the disease.
Two internal infections were detected on Thursday, one in a male in his 20 ’ s, and the other in a male in his 20 ’ s.
At that time, no infection had been detected since the beginning of the month.
Yesterday, three more internal infections were diagnosed, one of which had been on the Rey Cup soccer test at Laugardal.
In a conversation with a news agency, Joan K. Joannsson, a director of the State Department, says that there were fewer tests because of this infection than originally thought.
Another infection is that of a person who arrived in the country from a foreign country on July 15.
Then the rules of the so - called return disease had become valid.
Kamilla Rut Sigfusdóttir, an expert in the field of health care at the County Council, says that he or she followed the old practice.
His vision was negative when he arrived in the country, and he became ill and was isolated with six sick people.
All of them are on their way to audition, but two of them are beginning to show signs.
The third infection has been related to the elderly person who was diagnosed on Thursday, and 12 have been associated with it.
It has been found on this trip that a new form of the Cronus virus, which has not been identified in the past in this country.
“ We don’t know exactly where this virus comes from, but we haven’t seen it before.
The one who was thought to have carried the virus to the land had been in Israel but also in other European countries —
She believes it is too early to claim that the so - called second wave of epidemic has set off in this country, as other European countries fear.
“ While the majority is still traceable, it is not eating that way.
But we are on our toes and watching, minding ways to respond if something like that could start.
Megan Fox will express himself on the relationship.
Megan Fox says he found his twin soul in the rapper Machine Gun Kelly.
“ After I met him and looked into his eyes, I knew.
I am interested in constellations, and immediately I knew that my twin soul was about, ” says 34 - year - old Fox.
“ The twin soul is when the soul has reached a sufficient level of existence so that it can divide itself into two different bodies at the same time, ” explained Fox.
“ So we are two and a half of the same soul, I think.
I told him as soon as we met.
I found it right away —
“ When we had known him for two days, I asked him to meet me for lunch, and I taught him about the constellations and asked him into his life.
I decided to go to the depths right away —
Machine Gun Kelly agrees, but they met at a movie.
“ I was hanging outside her trailer and hoping to see her.
She has the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen.
It's only been two months since Fox left his husband till ten years old, Brian Austin Green.
They have three sons together.

The American musician, the ten - dollar bag, and the presidential candidate Kanye West have apologized to Kim Kardashian West for the comments he had publicly made about the family’s personal affairs.
“ I want to apologize to my wife Kim for discussing private matters publicly, ” he wrote on Twitter last night.

In protests against racial discrimination in the United States, there was an increase in weight
The protesters have walked through the streets of many cities in the United States to draw attention to racial discrimination.
Objections have passed for two months in Portland, Oregon, since May 25 when George Floyd was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Trump government has sent FBI agents to Portland, which means they're still fueling the protest.
The protesters now also object to the presence of the FBI in the city.
In Seattle, Saturday, after protests to support protests in Portland, police used blasts and tear gas and arrested 45 people.
According to the police, over 20 police officers were injured.
One died on Saturday night in Austin, Texas, when a gun was fired into Black Lives Matter’s march.
Sources tell the media that the man may have gone up to an armed rifle before he was shot.
“ The bottom line is that it’s terrible that someone should die in protests, ” said Steve Adler, mayor of Austin.
Adler said that he was “shammed and speechless. ”
In Lousville, Kentucky, a group of armed Protestants demanded justice in Breonna Taylor, a black woman who died in Louisville when the police broke into her home, with permission to enter without knocking, and shot her.
Taylor’s boyfriend had first shot the police, thinking that they were burglars.
One policeman has been fired from Taylor’s death, but the other policemen have not been brought to trial.
The leader of the NFAC group, armed with a group of black rebels who have participated in the protests, calls for more transparency in a police investigation into Taylor's murder.
According to the police, on Saturday, three members of the NFAC were injured when a gun was accidentally launched by the Rebellion Army.
Possible seal group infection
Five have been diagnosed with Covid-19 infection this week outside the border.
Two of them were diagnosed with previously unseen viruses, and the origin of three out of five infections seems to be quite unclear.
It is uncertain whether the individuals have been infected by a tourist who has left the country or by the asymptomatic Icelandic, who likely infected a lot more people.
A health care professional has indicated that a potential group infection may be associated with one of the infections.
Two people diagnosed with Covid-19 on the land last Thursday, each with the type of virus.
The origin of the diseases is still unclear.
Three were diagnosed with the virus yesterday; one was infected by another diagnosed on Thursday; another came to the country last July 15 and was likely infected outside, but the third was also infected with unknown origin.
After a sequencing of the Icelandic genetic analysis, it was found that the two subjects identified with the virus and associated with its new variants who have not previously been identified in this country.
According to Kamilla Josephsdóttir, a specialist in the field of disease prevention at Landsäktor and the local health care professional, the Icelandic genetic analysis is now considering the most likely source of this type of virus.
“ The other case was similar to the virus that has been running in Switzerland but still not exactly the same.
They are going to look at this and try to map it out better, and they are going to show the chance to find out what part of the world is involved, ” she says.
\"It seems, though, to be on this side of the Atlantic Ocean...
Thus, the infection is unrelated to the two that arrived at the beginning of July and were traced to the United States.
Do you assume that this new species has gone beyond what has happened in the world?
“ Yes, this is different from what has been found here before, ” Kamilla answers, “that there is really no chance that something was going on here.
“They are all likely to have somehow come to terms with someone who has just arrived outside, without knowing it himself —
It says that there is no indication yet of where this new virus might have come from.
“ It could be a traveler leaving the country again, but it could also be someone who has no symptoms and does not realize that he has been infected and could naturally cause more infections.
We'll be on our toes for the next few days to keep an eye on it.
“ In the meantime, there is no such thing as a smart group infection.
However, there are individuals who have had an illness in connection with one of the infections yesterday, who have had symptoms and have already had an exercise, — Kamilla continues.
“ We haven’t had the results yet.
Thus, there could possibly be a group infection in the sealing system -
Do you assume that there is a community infection now?
\"That's not impossible.
This has not been the case recently, but it is not excluded because we do not know who has been exposed to this infection in these individuals, who were diagnosed on Tuesday and yesterday, but who are responding.
Could it be said that there is now a new wave of the virus?
- No, not yet.
But we naturally need to be very alert, and we need to keep this in mind, even though there are so many limitations to how much we can take in people’s visions.
We don’t take samples from asymptomatic people, but since we’re getting infections that seem unsteady, we need to be given a little more loose hands by taking samples from people with symptoms, ” she says.
In this way, the Landspital infection and viral division is expected to be present in the sample in the following days in order to try to better map the situation in the country.
Does the County Hospital have the ability to increase the level of internal screening and screening?
“ Not limitless, no.
Therefore, there needs to be some basis for taking a sample of people who are not in the screening exercise; they need to have an illness and symptoms, or they should have had symptoms and a suspicion of getting to the point of being able to get to someone who has just arrived in the country or something like that, says Kamilla.
It claims that infection is still taking place on the infections that were diagnosed yesterday and that it is now a great deal of work to obtain information about individual travel.
It says that the origins of internal infections appear to be indisputable, but it does not rule out the possibility that any of those now infested can provide clues that eventually lead to the infection series.

Google Pixel 4 can form the galaxy
A double optical attraction enables the Pixel 4 lens to be visible in three dimensions, thereby returning a better memory in the background with a facial setting than in previous Pixel phones, which relied on software to achieve this so-called “bookeh” effect.
To demonstrate the quality of the camera, Google’s mythological photographer Annie Leibovitz got up on the scene to discuss his experience with Pixel 4 in the last 12 months.
Molecular research is still in the foreground of all aspects of new smartphones from Google, and in this phone the “computer-controlled photography” is new to improve the HDR+ setting by combining up to nine different pictures.
New dual lighting controls offer different slides for brightness and shade and enable users to preview HDR+ in real time.
The phone also relies on motor study to offer better automatic white-doing and to improve the Night Night Night setting, which is so sensitive that it can trap the Milky Way in the night sky.
In addition to a second camera lens, Pixel 4 Soli-Rati-Skyklintnæm - presents on the front of the phone that detects Motion Sense movements so that users can release a track, turn off timers, turn alarmers on the flash or turn off the phone’s sound by wavering hands.
All calculations Motion Sense takes place in the device instead of connecting to the Internet and the same applies to improved Google helpers, where the technology is now focusing on shortening the response time and improving the personal protection of users.
Continued focus on Google’s ability to fully use its machine-cycle capabilities has also resulted in a new voice recording app that encodes live audio without sending data to the Internet.
The app is available only in English, but more languages are expected.
Pixel 4 will also be the first call to support Google Stadia, a game field in the cloud to be fired from the 19th November in the United States, but the following one will be reported on the date for Australia.
Besides a new Pixel phone, Google also presented new Pixelbook Go Chromebook computer and other generation Google Pixel Buds hearing aids.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smartphone tool that is expected next year is completely wireless and features a sound adjustment that listens to the environment and constantly adjusts the sound to match it so that the clarity is as clear as possible.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart hearing tools are completely wireless and set the volume to match the noise around you.
Google also reported an update on its connected Wi-Fi home link in the Nest WiFi line with a special bone along with many basic points working together to improve a wireless connection within the home.
The new Wi-Fi system, which will record the Nest name, doubles its pre-existing range and adds built-in microphones and speakers to use the Google helper in each home base.
It is sold in Australia on November 5th, and costs 399 astraaludals for the bone and one Wi-Fi point or 549 dollars for two Wi-Fi points.
Google Home Mini has also been updated, but a new $79 Nest Mini improves the sound quality by double the bass and has been built in wall attachment.
All Google smart speakers will receive a new call system feature for communication between home devices, as well as the ability to call the Nest Mini outside the home using the Google Home app.

A catcher “seen throwing a bottle of beer into a seal — in Devon
A catcher threw a bottle of beer into a seal when he disturbed the fishing line, according to a charity association.

Duncan Kenny, who took the pictures, said that the grey seal had been caught when the rod hunter emptied out of a bottle and threw it in the back of the animal.
Kenny called it “a terrible and ruthless conduct —
He said that when he witnessed the attack, he was picking up garbage in this beautiful place on Devon’s last Sunday morning, along with other people at the Seal Project.
“ The soul tried to get on the fishing line, ” he said.
“ The hunter stretched the beer, emptyed the bottle, and threw it into the harness.
“ The bottle was on the back of the seller and he swam away —
One teacher said that “the best way to sell strong animals was to sell what was natural to him.
“ By throwing a bottle of glass into it, ” he said, “you are stopping him on his hunts.

Rising from a Christian Pole in Laxá, Dala
The first hundred were hunted in Laxá, in the Dead, later today.
It was at the hands of Arnór Isfjjör, son of Gudmund.
This morning, he had placed in a hedge at the Christian Pole, and it was an inch (89 cm) away.
After noon, he had another opportunity for a Christian Pole and was thought of a story that he had heard about the slowness of the horse’s hunting.
With this in mind, he took the crown of Collie Dog and threw it over the Christian Pole.
Soon he got a take, and as he tells himself.
“ After about five seconds, he cleaned himself completely, and I realized that it was a meter.
I was under a little stress because I had eleven pounds of rope.
I usually caught fish, but I had this for 40 minutes.
Actually, he was quite comfortable.
Took a few trips up and down the pole, but then I got to strand him and it was a great feeling.
Shouted off my pole and jumped on it.
He measured 102 centimetres, and I doubled him, ” said a happy hunter in the Laxá fishing house in Dala, in a conversation with Spears.
Arnor, for example, is no beginning when it comes to hundreds.
It was his eighth.
He had such fish in Bræda, Black, Hurl, Barrey, two in Langadalsá, and one in the east of Rangá.
A good catch is in Laxá, Dala, according to Arnor.
The hole that ends at noon tomorrow is brought with 35 salmon and our man has eighteen of them.
Expecting Great Floods for Hannah
Hanna, the first hurricane of the Atlantic this year, reached a country in Texas, U.S.A., last night.
Hannah quickly lost her power and became stormy, yet great rain has taken place in the area and is expected to be great floods.
It is expected to rain up to a hundred inches [30 cm] in one day, but in special places it could reach as much as four inches [46 cm], according to the AP news agency.
Especially is there a warning about a dangerous sudden flood that could occur because of the rain.
The area where Hanna reached the country has been hit by the widespread distribution of the new crown virus there.
In addition, seawaters have landed and caused damage.
Now there are at least 43,700 people without electricity, and many help stations in the area have been opened.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, sat about the hurricane last night and said it was important that people listen to experts and follow instructions.
Below is a video captured this morning by AP’s photographer.
House burned, shops robbed, and interior damage
More than sixty are dead and another sixty are wounded after an attack in the village of Masteri, Darfur, in Sudan yesterday.
The attack “was the latest in a series of serious security incidents in the last few weeks in which houses were burned, traded, robbed, and damaged, as stated in a statement by the United Nations Humanitarian Office in the capital city of Kartum, which was sent today.
Abdalla Hamdoc, the prime minister of Sudan, has announced that security forces will be sent to the war - torn region to “protect the inhabitants and the harvest ”
Only two days ago an unknown army in the area killed at least 20 public citizens, including children, in another attack.
“The rise of violence in different parts of Darfur region is leading to an increase in the rate of corruption, endangering and threatening agriculture and the lives of people,” says the United Nations.
The conflict in Darfur, in the western part of Sudan, began in 2003 when most Arab rebels rose against the governor of Kartum.
The military forces of the government and Arab troops who tried to break down the rebellion have been accused of widespread cruelty, while some 300,000 were killed in the conflict as assessed by the United Nations.
Omas al-Bashir, who was cast off the chair of Sudan’s leader, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for his supposed war crimes, genocides and crimes against humanity in Darfur.
Meanwhile, new governments in Sudan are now trying to negotiate peace with major rebel groups.

Jeronimo Open Space area part closed temporarily after two attacks by coyotes - CBS Los Angeles
Two were bitten by coyotes near the Oso Creek route on Jeronimo Road in Mission Viejo on Saturday morning and had to close the route temporarily.
Laura Wittmer claims to see a coyote almost every morning and usually she tries to avoid them only, but on Saturday morning one came directly to her and bit her leg.
The route has been closed while the attacks are being investigated.
The Mission Viejo published a story that said: “Today two different parties announced that a co-operation with the Fish and Animal Life Department and part of Jeronimo Open Space has been closed.
Wittmer tried to beat off the coyote with a bottle of water.
She called the emergency line to get to her car, but she could drive to an emergency room.
The pup wolf disappeared in the hills, but official workers hope to run it and test it for rabies.
Wittmer is treated for rabies as a precaution for the next two weeks.
She said that this horrifying incident would not keep her away from the dawns, but from now on she would choose another place.
The situation of the other person who was bitten is not clear.
Conventions against racial hatred coincide with Seattle police forces
A conflict in Seattle on Sunday between police and protesters against racial hatred ended by the arrest of many people, but the discontent among the public due to Donald Trump's plan to send a number of FBI agents into major cities.
As a result of George Floyd’s death, an unarmed black man, in Minneapolis, May, protest against racial hatred and police violence.
The protesters in Seattle cut down on bicycle - bard cars and broke a wheel - trailerd window on Saturday’s protests, causing police to declare rioting conditions, emptying the streets with pepper sprays and blast bombs.
The conventioners also set a trailer on fire in a building area for prospective juvenile prisons.
The police said they arrested 45 people, but 21 policemen would have been injured.
