AM in Wales is worried about "standing like puckon"
Some AM members of the Wales National Assembly are confused about a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Wales Parliament).
The proposal will, on the basis of plans, change the name of the National Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
AM across the political spectrum is worried about being ridiculed.
An AM for Labour said his group was worried because "it's jamming with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who can't Welsh: Twp means stupid in Welsh and pwp means bajs.
An AM for Plaid said that the group was generally "dissatisfied" and has proposed other options.
A conservative walker said his group is "open" for the name change, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context W in Welsh is spoken like the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which currently compiles legislation for the change of names, said: "The final decision for what members of the congregation should be called is clearly up to the members themselves."
Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh congregation the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the Assembly for the Wales Parliament.
The title of AM was proposed by the Commission to the Welsh Parliament Members (Members of the Wales Parliament) or WMP, but MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
AM apparently suggests other options, but problems with reaching a consensus can cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the amendment within a few weeks.
The legislation for the amendments also includes other changes in the way the assembly works, including rules for disqualifying an AM and designing the comitology system.
AM may vote on what to call them when they debate the legislation.
Macedonia is holding a referendum to change its name
On Sunday, the voters will vote to change the country's name to the People's Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is an attempt to end a dispute that has been going on for decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Mr Ivanov, opposes the referendum on the exchange of names and has said that he will ignore the outcome.
But the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zaev, argue that the exchange of names is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's are silenced when the churches in Harlem encounter problems
"Elder people I talk to say there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Now there is neither."
He said it's understandable that the bars disappear.
"People hang out in other ways nowadays," he said.
"Bars aren't like the living room of the area anymore, where people go on a regular basis."
In the case of the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough as far as the leaders expect and that "before or later they end up on square one again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments filled with people who do not help remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to the closing of all the churches, because those who move into the apartments probably will not become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist Assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had a church nearby took over the building.
St Martin's was taken over by a black assembly led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of stores on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson's parish planned the renovation they also built the bell game.
Pastor David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor to St Martin's, called the proud music game "the watches of the poor."
The expert who played the watch game in July had another name for it: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first watch game played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who moved on to the larger watch game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
The events of the last few months at St. Martin's are a complicated history with architects and entrepreneurs – some of the church's playmates, others of the episcopal tribe.
The church cook — the governing body of the congregation, composed of laymen — wrote to the diocese in July and expressed concern that the diocese would "try to transfer the cost" to the church general, even though the synod had not been involved when the diocese hired architects and entrepreneurs.
Some members of the congregation complained of a lack of transparency from the diocese.
Shark damages 13-year-olds who dive after lobsters in California
On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who appeared after lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack took place just before seven o'clock in the morning, near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had dived with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shout for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy was only happy to have found a lobster, but then he realized that the boy screamed, "I've been bitten!"
"I've been bitten!"
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he noticed that the whole leg had been torn up.
"I called to everyone to get up out of the water." "It's a shark in the water!" said Hammel.
The boy flew to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is stated to be critical.
It's unclear what a shark it was.
Well, Larry Giles told the media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been found that it wasn't a dangerous shark.
Giles also said the victim suffered trauma damage on his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but that most people are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's enters Britain's beauty market
Sainsbury's takes on Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with departmential beauty paths with beauty specialists.
As part of a significant push into the UK beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the fall of the fashion and household markets, the major beauty paths will be tested in 11 stores the country over and implemented in more stores next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the supermarket's attempt to fill the shelves that used to be picked up by TV appliances, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said they're going to double their beauty range to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get larger space with selected areas, as in stores like Boots.
The chain also launches its boutique brand again so that most of the products are vegan – as more and more young customers demand.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test stands in two Sainsbury's shops – the first stand opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the second one opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend of buying less food every day in local shops mean that supermarkets need to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their stores will look increasingly like stores in an effort to fight against cheap shops like Aldi and Lidl with more services and other products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos stands in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitats since they bought both chains two years ago, which, according to them, has increased the sales of food and made the acquisition more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a facelift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended after a dispute about how the revenues from Boots' sales in the supermarket would be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the line Lloyd's Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
They argue that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an extended range of luxurious skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial manager, said: "We have given our beauty paths a new look and a new feel to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can advise customers.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all the needs, and with an attractive environment in smooth places we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "raise" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the deal of £11 million
Dragons Den-star Peter Jones is "rendering" that TV representative Holly Willoughby withdraws from a deal of £11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time for their brand Truly, with leisure wear and accessories.
Their business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
This Morning presenter, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons The Star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle brand at the last minute – to focus on their new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources Jones was "raising" at a tense meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire last Tuesday when the TV favorite admitted that her new contract – worth up to £1.5 million – meant that she no longer focused on their brand Truly, with leisure clothing and accessories.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she's leaving Truly on Instagram, Jones flew to one of her holiday homes.
One source said: "Truly was clearly Holly's top priority.
That would be her long-term future for the coming decades.
Her decision to withdraw shocked everyone involved.
No one could think it happened on Tuesday, so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold at the Marlow headquarters."
Experts believe that the decision to withdraw by this Morning Representative can cost the company several million due to significant investments in everything from pillows and candles to clothes and the risk of further delays in launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The three-year-old Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role as chairman in March.
Couple holidays together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand coordinator for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of "I'm a Celebration" on ITV.
A source near Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business."
Tough talk, "and we fell in love."
He was joking about the media criticizing him for a comment that some would consider to be "disregardful of a president" and because he was so positive about North Korea's leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a "newsman's voice":
"I've given up nothing."
He said Kim wants a second meeting after Trump praised their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been under way.
Over three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea’s top diploma Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the UN General Assembly in Saturday that North Korea does not see a “equivalent response” from the United States after the first disarmament step.
He noted that instead, the United States continues sanctions designed to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his followers.
"Norwegian's doing great," he said.
"We were about to fight with North Korea.
Millions would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his attempts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results – an end to rocket tests, freed hostages and returned remnants of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this packed arena we'd have about 200 people here," said Trump and pointed at the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake ruin island in Indonesia, hundreds die
After the earthquake at Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although over 10% of the people of Lombok had lost their homes, it was not declared an emergency permit, which is required for international assistance.
"In many cases, they have, unfortunately, been very clear about not asking for international help, which makes it all complicated," said Ms. Sumbung.
Save the children gather a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear whether foreign personnel can work there.
Mr. Sutopo, the Director of the Natural Disaster Bureau, said that Indonesian officials evaluated the situation in Palu to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in aid work.
In view of the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still tragically unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Tsunami protection has been built in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The lack of a tsunami alert in Palu, despite the fact that a warning had been issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions it is a challenge to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that has been anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent huge sums on roads and rail tracks.
But poor funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration for next year's election.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from the fact that the fact that the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith in Indonesia is a factionary sectarian tension.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, arrow bows and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge signed at the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute of the Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri around 30 metres from Chelsea’s goal when his team was behind with 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick against the remove pole.
The attempt flew high above the target area towards the upper right corner of the grid.
The ball finally fell over Kepa Arrizabalaga's jump and ended up in the net.
"I was just trying to get in a position to access the ball and players like Shaq always play ahead as much as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming close and I didn't think so much about it, I just kicked it."
Chelsea led 1-0 after the first half after a goal in the 25th minute of Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue snout poured a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, spinned off near the middle field and sprinted to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go at the center field.
Then he got a great kick that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard ran from the defense and got the ball in the net at the outer post with a left-foot kick past Liverpool Alisson Becker.
Liverpool is fighting Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea is facing the VIdeoton in the Uefa Europa League in London at 15:00 on Thursday.
Tsunami death rate in Indonesia rises to 832
The death rate for the earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster agency early on Sunday.
Many people were reported to have been caught in the ruins of buildings that raged in the 7.5 earthquake that struck on Friday and triggered waves of up to six metres, said the firm’s spokesman Suttopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The town of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was full of bristles from buildings that were raging.
Police arrest, 32, suspect of murder after a woman is killed
A murder investigation has started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 with a knife wound on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested suspected of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who saw or heard something to come forward.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "We are at an early stage of the investigation, but I ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask all, especially taxi drivers, who might have filmed something with a car cam to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the woman found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
In the afternoon friends who think they know the woman arrived to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police report to the victim's next family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but the police said no one can get in or get out of the building.
He became aimless when he found out what had happened.
The residents of the building have been informed that it takes several hours to get back in.
A police officer told a man that the whole area is being treated like a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She says "it's so terrible" over and over again.
At 14:00 there were two police cars inside the perimeter and another just outside.
A number of police officers were inside the perimeter with an overview of the apartment building.
People with information are asked to send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crime Stoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell's latest victim of arguments for rewriting history
A ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion "badness" and "try to write about history."
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be drawn into the ongoing debate on removing statues."
The Iconoclass during the English civil war was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Maybe wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for what his forefather Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thornycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the 19th century's opinion of and is part of historiography for a man who many consider to be still to be praised.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more in the late 1800s than now, believe that Cromwell defended Parliament against outside pressure, in his case from the monarchy.
If this is a proper representation, then an ongoing historical debate is under way.
But the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has undoubtedly affected our nation's development, and Cromwell is a well-known person who represents one side of the matter.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be praised and celebrated.
Killer pig kills farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in south-west China, according to local media reports.
The man, who is only identified with his last name Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood in a stale on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine into pigs in a pig’sche on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is reported to have travelled with his cousin from neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and found out that the door of a pig trail nearby was open.
He said there was a big pig dog in the pigry with blood on his mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-pound pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's bones were bloody and distorted," said the cousin identified with the last name Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 p.m. Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to avoid further attacks while the police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market leaders are reported to negotiate compensation for his death.
It's rare that pigs attack people, but it's happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and gave the man serious damage.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - pound [300 kg] pig pressed a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "catalyst".
"They're just playful.
They're very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
The remains of hurricane Rosa for extensive heavy rain to southwestern United States
As predicted, hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it travels over cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flooding rain to northern Mexico and south-west America in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind power of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at 5 EST on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a train begins to form across the Pacific Ocean and travels east toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture north into the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching troughs will create vastly heavy rain in the south-west of the United States in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5-10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, clay flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5–7.5 cm rain per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5-10 cm of rain is expected in some places in the southwestern United States, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered tropical rain.
It is certainly not recommended for anyone to leave the desert on foot when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rains can make cannons flowing rivers and thunder storms lead to strong local winds blowing around sand.
The approaching troughs bring some locally strong rain to parts of southern California’s coastline.
A total of over one cm of rain is possible, which can lead to clay flows and smooth roads.
That would be the first rain in the area during the rain period.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain gets more extensive later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October can mean intense temperature changes throughout the United States, when the Arctic is cooled down but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes at short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States on Sunday.
There is almost ten degrees difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of central and eastern United States are expected to get a warm start on October with around 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of northeastern United States.
New York can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about five degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a great chance for warmer temperatures than the average in the Eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million looked at Brett Kavanaugh's interrogations
Over 20 million people watched Thursday's moving testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault that should have taken place in the 1980s, on six television networks.
In the meantime, the political deadlock continued and the normal transmission was interrupted for Friday's last minute-twist – Arizona Senator Jeff Flake's contract with the FBI where they got one week to investigate the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she's absolutely certain that Kavanaugh was snuck at her when he was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said he's absolutely sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers on Friday was higher than the 20.4 million indicated by Nielsen.
They calculated average number of viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other TV networks that showed the interrogation, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has problems counting people watching from offices.
Comparably, there are as many viewers as there are for a football game in the playoffs or Oscarsgalan.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, had the majority of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long interrogation, according to Nielsen.
ABC had the next most with 3,26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the interrogation.
Fllake was in focus during Friday's drama.
After the Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS filmed protestors screaming at him when he tried to take an elevator to an interview with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the demonstrators shouted at him, which was shown in live transmission of CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors closed, he said he would have more to say after the interview with the committee.
The TV networks sent live several hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted to pass on Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the entire Senate.
But Flake said he was only going to do it if the FBI were to investigate the allegations against the nominees in the coming week, as the minority democrats have claimed.
Flake was partially convinced by his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump started an FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political games" about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" about Britain's future and to undermine the interests of the nation in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that the proposal for the UK and the EU to collect each other's customs duties was "fully unreasonable".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspected Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for murder, said the police in Baton Rouge.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims dropped his glasses in the battle.
The police found the glasses on site and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS' subsidiary WAFB.
After questioning with Simpson, the police said he confessed that he killed Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to Advocate.
The medical officer in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a bullet wound in the head and into the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Force, the police's state justice team, the Southern University Police and residents in the area for assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "service and quest for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98 - foot - long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
Last Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "crying" and "chock" of Wayde's death.
"You're worried about these things all the time," said Wade.
Volcan ask ash over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatépetl has reached the southern part of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity had been detected in the crater and the registered 183 emissions of gas and ash over the course of 24 hours.
The center discovered several mules and scalps.
Social media images showed thin stocks of ash on windscreens in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have noted increased volcanic activity, which stands 72 km southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police are in contact with Catalan separatists for the anniversary of the referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters struck with the skull police while thousands of people took part in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists held back by the Scallpolis threw eggs and powder on them, leading to dark dust on the streets that are usually full of tourists.
Fights also broke out later during the day, and policemen used their batons to stop them.
For hours, the independence groups cried out 'never forget, never forgive', while the Unionists cried out 'long live Spain'.
14 persons were treated for minor injuries caused by protests, according to local pressure.
The meeting is still tense in the region, longing for independence one year after the referendum on the first October considered illegal by Madrid but praised by Catalan separatists.
An overwhelming majority voted in favour of independence, but the participation was low when most opposed to the delay boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1 000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when the police tried to stop the vote at election stations in the region.
Independence groups camped during the night of Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but was forced to take another route.
Elektriken Narcis Termes, 68, took part in the protest of the separatists with his wife and said that he no longer believes that Catalonia will become independent.
" Last year, we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy about being able to vote, but now we've got stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal profit in regional elections in December, Catalan parties that are for independence have had difficulty keeping the driving force up this year, as many of their most well-known leaders live in self-imposed exile or are in custody pending the trial of their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his cell phone, said that the conflict had been fired on by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting tense ever more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year, announced that he will be able to do so in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
He said: "Wanting the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the subjugation we have experienced from the Spanish Government."
Londonderry: Men arrested after car drive into the house
Three men — 33, 34, and 39 — have been arrested after a car was driven into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The Incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 7:30 BST on Thursday.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
An armbrush may also have been fired against the car.
Menga gives Livingston 1-0 to the Rangers
Dolly Mengas first goal for Livingston secured the profit
Livingston shocked Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss of 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mengas’s strike proved to be the difference when Gary Holt’s side was divided by Hibernia.
Gerrard's side still hasn't received a win-off in the Premiership this season and meets Hearts, with eight more points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers Rapid Vienna welcomes Thursday's meeting of the Europa League.
Livingston extends his profit distance to six games – the main coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against cross-visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before they scored goals; their frankness gave Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his performance across the target, and then Alan Lithgow could just shoot wide after he slipped in to measure Craig Halkett's nod across the target.
The home team satisfied themselves with letting Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could attack in definite games.
And that's how the crucial goal was done.
The Rangers gave up a freespark and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to give Menga a chance, which made goals from the middle of the finish area.
In that situation the Rangers had dominated the ball, but the home team's defense was unrelenting and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was left largely in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half of the play, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot wide from another of Livingston's definite games.
Crosses constantly entered Livingston’s target area and were handled without problems. Two criminal requirements – after Halkett’s challenge by the exchanger Glenn Middleton and one by hand – were dismissed.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Fenomenal display and results for Livingston.
Every single one of them was outstanding and continues to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their playing style and staff have hardly changed since they returned to the top level, but Holt deserves credit for having galvanized the team since their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a skillfully organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the helm right through.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their moments under Gerrard, but they didn't live up to standard.
Their last ball did not hold the measure – they only opened the home side once – and it is something of an alarm clock for the Rangers, which is located in the middle.
Erdogan receives a mixed welcome in Cologne
Saturday invited smiles and blue skies (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – to repair the relationship between the NATO allies.
They have been shattered by human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world's largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed that they prevented 25 000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many followers gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti- Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurdish – also heard their voices and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German Government's decision to welcome him to Germany.
The dual protests show the divided views of a visitor who is considered to be a hero of some German Turks and condemned as a violent ruler of others.
Road Accident in Depford: Cyclist dies in a crash by car
A cyclist died in a crash with a car in London.
Krocken took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-trafficked road in Deptford, southeastern London, around 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped the car and the car repair was called there, but the man died at the scene.
Krocken takes place a few months after another cyclist died in an infection accident on Childers Street, around 1.5 km from the hook last Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said they're trying to identify the man and inform his next family.
Roads have been blocked off and buses have been redirected and car drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in a tummy
Six prison guards have been injured in disturbance in a high security prison for men, according to Prison Office.
The unrest broke out at the HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and is still going on.
Specialized tornado guards have been called there to deal with the disturbances, involving eight prisoners on a wing.
The guards were treated on site for minor facial lesions.
A spokesperson for Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison staff have been sent there to handle the ongoing incident at the HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those who are behind this will be referred to the police and can have an extended prison sentence."
HMP Long Lartin holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, the Krall Police were called to prison to deal with serious disturbances where personnel were attacked with billiards.
The hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flood (areas with drought can benefit)
It is rare that tropical low pressure reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy draws across the desert in the south-west United States, with the risk of sudden flooding.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and bring rain late on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of the Arizona border".
National Hurricane Centers latest models predict 5-10 cm rain, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the south-west United States, including central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, probably get 2.5–5 cm rain at risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without risk of sudden floods, Rosa's rain can be a blessing, because the region is hit by drought.
Flooding is very serious, but part of the rain will probably be of use because the southwestern United States suffers from drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor suffers just over 40 percent of Arizona of at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reportedweather.com.
The Orcan Rosa will first travel across the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane strength in Sunday morning with a maximum wind power of 135 km/h, is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north for 20 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler water in the Pacific Ocean, which calms it down.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico’s land mass as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico can have heavy rain, which represents a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 7.5–15 cm of rain is expected from Baja California to north-western Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm", reportedweather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very strong rain in Baja California, north-west Sonora and desert in the south-west US," said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life threatening floods and clay flows in the desert, as well as landslides in rocky terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three boys in their teens and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the situation is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the area of Radstock, said the police in Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking everyone who could have filmed what happened to the phone to come out.
Trump says Kavanaugh "led, evil, anger" from the Democratic Party
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the democratic party's ruthlessness and shamless tactics," said Trump to his followers in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "expressed evil, anger" from the democratic party during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed to Congress on Thursday and strongly denied Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he engaged in sexual intercourse with her several decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified before the Congress about his accusation.
The president said last Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliant and the quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most skilled legal minds of our times, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public," he told his followers in the audience in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming central elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I don't mean to, but I'm trying to do it," he said.
"That's why I go around fighting for sovereign candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are trying to "stand up and prevent".
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to a senior republican leader.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, rising
At least 384 people died, many were swept away when gigantic waves crashed against the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu last Friday when up to six meters high waves crashed towards the beach at dusk and swept many out to a safe death and destroyed everything in their way.
Tsunamine came for an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami came yesterday, people stopped on the beach instead of immediately running away, and they fell victim to the tsunami," said Suttopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster agency GDPB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"Tsunamine was not alone but dragged cars, logs and houses. It hit everything in its path," said Nugroho. He also said that the tsunami had traveled on the open sea for up to 800 km/h before the hit coastline.
Some climbed up trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
The aerial photos released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and have collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
In the wake of this, the coastal city was still hit on Saturday.
The line of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesia Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology BPT said in a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake on Friday was 200 times the nuclear bomb released on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the destruction as "wide" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found under the bridge of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and injuries can be even worse along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is nearer the earthquake epicenter.
The communication from Donggala "was completely paralyzed without any information", said Nugroho.
"There are over 300 000 people there," said the Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
The firm was criticised on Saturday for not having informed that the tsunami had struck Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had appeared within the time when the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man is heard upstairs in a building shouting frenetic warnings about tsunamis to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water crashes to the beach and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authentication the video.
Earthquakes and tsunamis led to an extensive power outage that interrupted all communications around Palu, making the rescue work difficult for the authorities.
The military has started sending cargo flights with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated people are still in great need of food and other supplies.
The airport of the city has been opened for the relief work and remains closed for other traffic until October.
President Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in tsunamis in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
The employees from the World Vision in Donggala have gone to Palu, where they seek shelter under tarpaulins at the farm outside the office, but they saw destruction along the way, according to Mr. Dosaba.
"They said they saw a lot of broken houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Assistance groups have started the intensive aid work, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and employees from abroad may only be used if an emergency permit is declared after a disaster.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the authorities say it is a national disaster, we can let in international aid, but that status has not yet been announced."
When the second evening fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of missing persons still hoped that their loved ones would prove to be the miracles that light up gloomy natural disasters.
Last Saturday a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
Last Sunday, the rescue workers saved a woman who was trapped under a fire for two days with her mother’s body next to him.
Gendon Subandolo, Indonesia's National Screen Flight Trainers, had trained two of the missing screeners for the Asian games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandami, were his students.
"As a screen-flying vet, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told me that the hours after the screeners heard that Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages only got one gray cock, instead of two blues.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered," he said.
Thives take $26 750 during ATM filling at Newport on the Live
Last Friday morning thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who filled out a ATM at Newport on the Live, according to a press release from the Newport Police.
The driver of the car had emptyed a ATM in the entertainment facility and would deliver more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While he was busy, another man picked up behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects running from the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
Any person with information on the identity of the perpetrators shall contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapparen renames Ye
The Rappar Kanye West changes name – to Ye.
He announced his name change on Twitter last Saturday and said, "The creature that is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41,has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturn Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande in the program, who set out for "female reasons" according to the programme's creators.
Ye is a abbreviation of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he talked about the title of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means 'the only', to just Ye – a mirror of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a mirror of those we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who's changed their names.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously worked with West, has previously written his name with and without tie bars and capitals.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's recently elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the military against civilians now that the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody retribution against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza Saturday that "never use the military to suppress the Mexican people".
The troops fired weapons against a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, and killed up to 600 people during an era of left-wing student movements in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans with monthly contributions to students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and inadequate educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double AI funding
Now that China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research in the field, according to the inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The commenter comes after several parts of the US government have made statements on AI, although the US does not have a comprehensive formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of becoming an AI-innovation leader before 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for the next breakthrough within AI," said Lee.
A double as large budget can double the chance that the next major AI breakthrough is made in the United States," said Lee to CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published earlier this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most outstanding AI companies – Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that hit the top ranking American Othello player, and later he was in charge of Microsoft Research and was CEO of Google's China department.
Lee mentioned previous technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as Robot Challenge from Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what the next one would be to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, scientists often have to work hard to get funds from the government, says Lee.
"It is not China that takes the academic leaders from us, but companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed leading personalities from universities to work at AI.
Lee said that new immigration policies can also help the US with the AI innovation.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctoral students within AI," he said.
The State Council in China issued its development plan for the next generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation grants funds to people at academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organisations distributing funds to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
American legislation that would create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not made any progress in several months.
Macedonia's referendum on the exchange of names
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum to change their name to "The People's Republic of North Macedonia", which would solve a number of decades of old controversy with Greece which has prevented the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its neighbor in the north constitutes a requirement on its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the exchange of names would undermine the identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Ivanov has said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the minimum participation of 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid will be reached.
The question of the rollover in the referendum is as follows: "Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
But the supporters of the change of names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is worth changing names if it means that Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia split, can join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough Members of this House have said they intend to follow the outcome for it to be considered decisive.
The change of name requires a majority of two thirds of Parliament.
According to the State Election Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 13 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in Skopje capital.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in the Macedonian referendum on the country's change of name, which would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia 30 September 2018.
Outside the House in Skopje, 54 Vladimir Kavardarkov, organized a small scene and place of chairs in front of the tent that was set up by those who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go with our heads in the air, not sneaking in through the back door," said Kavardarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership of NATO would lead to much needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that the absolute majority will vote yes, because over 80% of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said when he voted.
He said that a 'yes' result would be a 'confirmation of our future'.
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies, between 30 and 43% of voters voted in the referendum, which falls below the minimum participation required.
According to another study conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of the participants were voting on Sunday.
70% of them were going to vote yes.
In order for the referendum to count, 50 percent of registered voters must vote plus one.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious backlog of the Western-oriented government policy since it took over last May.
Look at: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero gets through the whole Brighton defense to make goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling struck Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's win of 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously simple when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a pass from the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and went out in the open.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around a defender and ran away from several others at the edge of Brighton's target area.
Then he threw a pass to Sterling on the left.
The English predecessor used his first kick in the target area to give back the ball to Aguero, who used the right foot to beat Brighton's goalie Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," said City's manager Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
"We talked about him playing in 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial take over in the Premier League match.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's reef on that game.
He sent off a nice kick along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a pair of kicks and led Sterling to the distant post.
Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net moment before it got out of reach.
City meets Hoffenheim in the group game in the Champions League at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from the playoffs, so there was no reason to force one to start.
But Scherzer's competition-oriented wish to throw on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only about Rockies, which is a game before Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still has a chance to finish the game.
Rockies got a wild card place with a win of 5-2 over the Nationals this Friday night, but is still after their first division title.
"We play about nothing, but we can get a chance to rub rubber in knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the other team would play at a higher level than any other team I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be there?"
Nationals have not notified their starter for Sunday yet, but according to reports they are leaning against letting Scherzer throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, warmed up in the plunger on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest day.
Washington's right-handed castleer is 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 innings this season.
Trump keeps numbers in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he spoke about how important it is that republicans vote in the forthcoming central elections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the great, great... I don't candidate, but I candidate. That's why I go around fighting for sovereign candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see a terrible, horrible group of radical democrats, you see it happen here and now.
They are determined to take back power whatever is required, you see their evilness, their terribleness.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take control of power and control. That's what they want, power and control.
Democrats, he said, struggle to "stand against and prevent".
"You've seen that for the last four days," he said, and he called the Democrats "arga and evil and terrible and false."
He mentioned the democratic senator Diane Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is being met by high-bought from the spectators.
"Do you remember what she said?
'Did you make the document?'
"Oh, uh, huh?
No, no, no, I'm expecting a...' It was really bad body language, one of the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They do not tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a series of MPs from Labour who are told that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way when she resisted anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe – ironically similar topics that Jeremy previously criticised for.
The Communication on the Meeting with Nottingham East Labour on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be welcoming and productive".
For most of my eight years as Labour's local MP, the GC meetings on Friday have been exactly that.
Unfortunately, many meetings are not, and the promise of "more friendly, more gentle" politics has been forgotten away a long time ago, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly apparent that dissenting views are not tolerated within Labour, and any opinion is judged on the basis of whether the party leaders accept it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues like me thought before had a political view that I expected I would make a complete conversion and take positions that I would never have agreed on – whether national security or the EU internal market.
Every time I speak publicly – and it doesn't really matter what I say – I follow a tens of ott on social media that requires me to be deposed, criticises my policy and says that I shouldn't even be in Labour.
And this doesn't just affect me.
In fact, I have more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the professionality and determination of these colleagues when they face a stream of sexist and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the greatest disappointments with this era's policy is the level of insults now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, however, we are no longer this broad church, and with every disbelief and change of the selection rules the party is becoming ever narrower.
I've been getting a lot of advice over the last two years about flying under radar and not being too straight ahead, so "it's going to be".
But that's not why I became a politician.
Ever since joining Labour as a school student 32 years ago, provoked by Thatcher's government neglect which literally caused the classroom of my primary school to collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it the most – both at the local level and as government minister.
I've never hidden my political opinions, and that includes the last choice.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused about my views on policies and topics where I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to you who promoted the request on Friday that when the country goes towards a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services I do not understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour party leader.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency – both Labour members and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threat of dedicating me or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I think is best for you all.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Unslagna Ayr on top
Two attempts at the last minute may have distorted the result a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this lovely entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They're now on top, the only unbeatable side of the ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, that gave the home team the profit, and coach Peter Murchie has all the right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested during our games so far and are still unbeatable, so we are of course happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than us."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card for Captain Rory Hughes of Scotland, released by Warriors for the game, had Melrose let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot made an unchanged attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty, and at the end of the first half he scored points and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead of 17-5 in the break.
But Melrose got a good start on the second half of the game and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
It then became a long wait for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the plan, and after the restart Ayr increased the management again with an attempt from Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
Ayrs acting Captain Blair MacPherson then got a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of heavy pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to have tackled Climo without the ball McPherson made a touch down from the penalty line-out behind Ayrs maul.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent off the flanker Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt of the home team.
Still Game Star seems ready for new restaurant careers
Still Game Star Ford Kiernan seems ready to enter the restaurant industry after he has been identified as CEO of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis is playing in the BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays in along with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
The duon has announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to plan for life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, he is the CEO of Ak driftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source at Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow's "flowering restaurant business".
"The Sea belongs to us": Kustlösa Bolivia hopes that the Court will open the way back to the Pacific
Seamen patrol a large-scale fleet headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have a sea blue flag.
Navy bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon's wear motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to recover it."
In coastal Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 1800s is still strong – and it is also longing to sail again on the Pacific Ocean.
This hope is higher than for decades now when Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on the first October, after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia has the operation, a atmosphere of unity and peace, and clearly awaits the outcome with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the international court's decisions on large screens throughout the country, in the hope that the Hague Court will judge for the benefit of Bolivia's demand that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, must negotiate with Bolivia to allow them to take their own exit to the sea.
Monday's decision also has a great deal of importance for Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president who is facing a controversial struggle for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is incredible that the Court of Justice is judging in favour of Bolivia, and that not much would change even if it does.
The United Nations Court of Justice, based in the Netherlands, does not have the right to assign Chilean territory and has decreed that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision is announced only six months after the final arguments indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the last four years, it may have been more damaging than promoting Bolivia's chances.
"The question of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration", said Zárate.
She claims that Morale's aggressive rhetoric has felt Chile's continuing goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, did not consider that the Court’s decision had been taken unusually quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia "a remarkable opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the issue of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up his right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he said.
"The conclusion is a chance to realize that we have to move on from the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament requires trust in the United States
North Korea's Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong Ho says that the nation will not take down its nuclear weapons until they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the two rival leaders.
His comments came when the U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of solving the deadlock of nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a "desirable" to continue sanctions and the United States' protests against a statement to end the Korean war will ever tame North Korea.
Washington hesitates to agree to the statement without Pyongyang first initiating significant nuclear disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism against Pyongyang really going to get rid of an armarsenal that the country probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line huge headbands on the way to stores near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
The Valentino and Thom Browne designers have revealed a range of high-sized headgear for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which dazzled the styles of Paris fashion week.
Amazingly Opractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designers have sent away their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino’s greatest creation was an exaggerated beige hat with a feather-like, wide hat board that completely took over the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a wizard hat and even an pineapple – but they are not meant to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, at the appropriate time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful worms had sewn lips together and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One creation resembled a wet suit with a string and a dive mask, and another looked like a melted glass rat.
And if you continue the enormous courage, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the huge stallions can be on your way to stores near you.
The oversized hats come shortly after La Bomba – the straw hat with a bar of 60 cm that has been seen on all from Rihanna to Emily Ratakowski.
The cult mark that was behind the incredibly Opractical hat that has taken over social media sent out another great creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the bathing suit that held in it.
The electricfia bag in terracotta, with electricfifrans and a white leather handle, was excellent in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris fashion week.
I expect me to see big hats and beach bags in the stores next summer – the designer has had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills crucial to global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain outstanding academic results and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, which are only reinforced by individual and collective progress in sport, art, music and other societal engagements.
With up to 30,000 students in Scotland, schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen careers and their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement custom curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and sought-after subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, he's going to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that not only can we rely in English when we create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's test results show that languages are highest on the list, with the highest number of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received A in the final test Higher Grade.
Data collected from SCIS 74 membership schools showed that 72 per cent of the students studying mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 per cent of the students studying German, 69 per cent of the students studying French, and 63 per cent of the students studying Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Language as a subject choice is now considered to be as important as natural knowledge, technology, engineering and mathematics at curricula in independent schools and beyond.
A study carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that employers had difficulties filling their vacancies for various reasons, with 17% attributed to a lack of language skills.
Having said that, language skills are all the more necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs requiring language skills, these skills are needed in a globalised world.
Regardless of their career choices, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adults British published by YouGov 2013, 75% replied that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that total came up in a two-digit percentage (15 per cent).
That is why it is so important to invest in language teaching for our children.
Being able to speak multiple languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance to find meaningful jobs in the future.
In Scotland, each school will teach different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important to Britain for 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and get them with the skills required to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In a global economic environment, it is undoubtedly a language that continues to be crucial for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in the education.
In fact, modern languages should indeed be regarded as "international communication capacity".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for Scotland’s young people.
I'm getting the bee le faire.
John Edward is Head of Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Lakersdebut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James making the debut for Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker's coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's first season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he's been playing hasn't yet been decided.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Laker's official website.
Laker's reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' preseasonal schedule.
"I don't need preseason games in this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia promotional events, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is doing his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first out of five planned performances in next week, including events in places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Pending a confirmatory vote of his candidate to the vacant post of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for future interim elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in the run-up to the current elections in November.
What time is Trumps West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trumps Wheeling, West Virginia promotional events are scheduled for 19:00, tonight Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trumps West Virginia-rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably deal with this week's interrogation of the candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense for accusations of his sexual abuse, with an expected delay in the vote from the Senate of up to one week while the FBI's investigation of the case is ongoing.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help Republicans get some meat on their legs before the November elections.
Thus President Trump said that next week's five gatherings aim to "sponsor volunteers and supporters as republicans try to protect and extend the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so important for his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the hectic campaign period," said a spokesperson for the Trump campaign who did not want to be named to Reuters.
Night events, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh's media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has been following the opinion polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come there to try to give him an increase in opinion polls," says Simon Haeder, a state scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is struggling to keep hopes alive for Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, the couple competitions in Saturday afternoon could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The model's swinging pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but something the players really believe in, and more than ever before in the face of competitions like these.
So what momentum is it now?
"They had a six-point line and now it's four, so we carry it as a little momentum I guess" said Jordan Spieth when he finished for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points advance with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have a little wind in the sails, but they have a lot to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and came home three points of four each.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to green and preceded by good example.
The trope balded even higher when his round continued and he lowered a decisive putt to take the match four all-quare when he and Thomas had been left behind with two after two games.
His putt who won them the game of 15 met with a similar vortex, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to win.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's unquestionable story.
Europe's odd but adorable couple are four from four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bookey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bookeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back Nine on Friday morning.
These achievements and audience reactions state that they are the players to beat on Sunday and there is no more popular player who could bring home a potential European win when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both, at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, along with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine lowered the Spanish and the Swedes in a hole they never even came near to crawl out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you out of the hole.
Fireball and Foursome are so fascinating to look closely at the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and how a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead for the last day but this Foursome session also showed that Team USA has a battle spirit that some, especially on the US side, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage on Ryder Cup's last day after coming out from Saturday's four-ball and foursomes matched by a 10-6-guide over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two wins over a siege Tiger Woods and came home with four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European law, which fought to keep the cup that they lost at Hazeltine two years ago dominated an American team that never really got started in the morning four-ball with 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the Foursom and won two games, but it was not enough for victory.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single matches to keep the bag.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, named "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend is just the second couple to win four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup's history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into four-ball, they struck a exhausted Woods and American Rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more repressive 5 & 4.
Woods, who got through two games on Saturday, showed off at single moments of brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball and four-some, and hence seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning four-ball and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in Foursomes to a 2 & 1-seger over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe did not have wind all the way, but it was a nice, windy day just southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas placed the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They brought home the victory with 2 & 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-ball and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history has a team come back from a position of four points in the single matches, however Fury's page only needs a definite result to keep the bag.
After two days it looks like a counterattack on Sunday can be difficult to get through.
North Korea says they'll never disarm one-sided without confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations last Saturday that continued sanctions deepened their mistrust against the United States and it was not possible that it would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important measures to demonstrate its goodwill", for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, disassemble nuclear tests and promising not to spread nuclear and nuclear technologies.
"We do not, however, see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to an approach divided into stages for the nuclear power that would result in the North Korea being rewarded when it took gradual steps, his statement seemed important because it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution quite as Pyongyang had previously done.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work towards "removal of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised assurances for North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean war 1950-53, but the USA has said that Pyongyang must first dismantle its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused negotiations to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on "removal first" and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose by force and even objects to "the declaration of the end of the war," says Ri.
"The idea that sanctions can get us on our knees is a wishful dream for those people who have no knowledge of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which USA leaders highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added: "If the party in this nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a deadlock."
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different than last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's future ability to reach the US mainland with rockets was inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim a "racethman" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to destroy "the whole" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take action to disarm, but it said that much work still remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday Trump said he had no time frame for this and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months", it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US State Secretary Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The maintenance of the Security Council sanctions must continue with force and without fail until we achieve a complete, definitive, verified disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to suffocate the funding of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programme.
Pompeo met Ri at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made. North Korea accused him a few hours later of setting "timer-like demands".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear missile complex if the United States took "equivalent action".
He said that Kim had told him that the "equivalent measures" he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and move towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has led all doctoral students to improve their sleep habits in an effort to combat the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-filled "dives".
An academic study found that students at the world's leading universities are often inconceivable about the very basis of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first in his battle in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deficiency on learning.
"At the end of that, a girl came up to me and said, "Why can't I know this until now, in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was organized for the first time this year, explains to the students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University's Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding that the students suffered from severe sleep loss during the week.
The time-long course includes a range of interactive tasks.
In part of the course there is a picture of a student room where the students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleep failure and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another part, the participants learn how long-term sleep failure can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of campuses, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the students' behavior directly.
But we think they have the right to know - just as one has the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "dying" still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep shortages were a growing problem.
To ensure that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain because insomnia puts the brain in a hungry state and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old california who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course and has studied one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course was an eye opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study programme before they begin their studies at the high performing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to lie down and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" issued by electronic displays and LED lighting, which may cause you to turn around in the 24 hours, leading to insoming problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengas Target Lowers Gerrard's Men
Rangers suffered yet another loss today when Dolly Mengas strike sent Steven Gerrard's uneven side to a 1-0-downer team in Livingston.
The Ibrox side was after taking home his first victory on the road since February 4-1-triumf on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his team eight points after Ladbrokes' premium leader Harts.
Menga struck seven minutes before half an hour and Rangers never managed to level the result.
While the Rangers now fall down to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and lies only behind Hibernia on the goal difference.
And there may be more problems on the air for Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was thrown away from the far end.
Gerrard made eight changes to the semifinal in Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 that took a point by Hearts last week and he would have been happy about the way his murderous game left the opponents each time.
Rangers may have dominated it, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
There should have been goals already two minutes into the game when Mengas's first pass let through Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his big chance and shot outside.
A deep park from Keaghan Jacobs then reached captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow reached only the rear post.
The Rangers took control of the match, but it seemed to be more hope than faith in their games during the final third of the match.
Alfredo Morelo probably felt that he should have been punished when he and Steven Lawless collide, but Judge Steven Thomson turned away the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers only managed to score two goals in the first half but the former Ibrox goaltender Liam Kelly easily received Lassana Coulibalys nick and a tam kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Livis opening shots in the 34th minute may have gone against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their knees deserved it.
Again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacob's permanent situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher suited to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple exit.
Gerrard acted on the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the exchange gave almost immediate effect when the outside knocked the ball into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block the experiment.
But Livingston continued to get the opponents to play exactly the kind of games they like, with Lithgow and Halkett who swept up long passes after long passes.
Holt's side could have strengthened his lead in the final stage, but McGregor could have managed to stop Jacobs before Lithgow nodded outside after the corner.
The Rangers-replacer Glenn Middleton had another late claim for punishment when he was trampled on Jacobs, but once again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the device called Geigermeter.
Geigerometers have become a cornerstone of science since then and also form great in pop culture, as well as in the 1950s "Bells of Coronado", with the leading role in seemingly unlikely cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
MAN "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geigermeter used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these headphones you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals. "Evans:
Evans: "Yes, it's popping now!"
"His" Geiger died 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method means extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancer forms and then re-injected.
A experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer, saw her ovarian cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer," Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and learning them how to target cancer cells has worked when treating a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA caps, after his SNL performance.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West beats out of the studio during Saturn Night Live after a dazzling appearance where he praised the United States President Donald Trump and said he himself would compete for post-2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he was wearing a Make America Great-Keps, he ran off against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I'm talking to a white person, they say, "How do you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Legal Committee on the allegations of sexual abuse made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it was not sent, the playback of West's release was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to run with West with the post.
West had also regretted himself before the audience that he had been harassed backstage for his headboned.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that cap on."
They bullied me!
And then they say I fell low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to sink low?" and said he would "put on my supermanscape, because that means you can't say what I'm allowed to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try love."
His comments attracted more burops at least twice from the audience and employees from SNL seemed embarrassed, reported Variety. One person said: "It became deadiest in the studio."
West had come in as a late substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with his appearance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative team TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: TACK FOR YOU TO BE AT YOUR MOST MOBB."
But the host of the show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West simply "was himself and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") which I think embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
So are we, she allowed.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the creature previously known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapparkollegt, Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and of course the deceased music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
The murder attempt after a knife cut at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been accused of attempted murder after a man is stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, said the police.
The defendant is expected to arrive at the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington beats toxic masculineity
Kit Harington is famous for his sword-sliding role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy-series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has expressed a negative opinion about the stereotype of the macho hero and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thinks "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-player in the Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, even her 31st, admitted that he felt "Ganish strongly" to deal with the problem.
"I personally feel quite strong, right now - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we raised men in terms of the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that TV can partly be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued "What's native and what's learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, which make young boys feel that they have to be in a certain way to be a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions today - how do we change it?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also acknowledged that he would not do any Game of Thrones followers when the series comes to an end next summer and says he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
From November Kit will play in a new recording by Sam Shepards True West, who is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience from the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife thanks to the series, so it gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygrite, as Kit's character Jon Snow falls in love with, in the Emmys-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, says health authorities.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were transferred through sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV is spread rapidly through certain parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero,” said Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000 from year to year.
HIV infection through intercourse is an urgent issue in China's HBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against HBTs is said to be widespread.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men sooner or later will marry women.
Many of the cases of infection are due to insufficient protection in connection with intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of its efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff leaked the data of the GOP senator, blames on "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. congressman Maxine Waters condemned Saturday allegations that one of her employees had posted personal data on three Republican American senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles-Demokraten argued that these claims were spread by right-wing extremeistic sites.
"Layers, lies and more repulsive lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The released information reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers to the Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during a Senate panel's interrogation of the allegations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters office and released information about a member of Waters staff, reported Hill.
"This unfounded statement is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security has been compromised by these fraudulent and false claims - were not in any way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded claim is entirely false and an absolute lie."
Water's statement quickly got criticism online, among other things from the White House's former press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," wrote Fleischer.
"This indicates that she does not have the temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they must not be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the motives of the questioner.
They must be calm and sensual."
Mr Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water's reaction with the democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of having seemed angry during Thursday's interrogation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who had the opportunity to turn Waters aside in the middle of the term of office, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Very true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned "appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities for these fraudulent demands.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again - powerless spy parodi by Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit benefits in every new movie with British tilt, and the same thing seems to apply for this new recording of the latest Johnny English action comedin - a series of spy parodies that were kicked off in 2003 with Johnny English and got new life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sharp satir about how manifestly bad we are to become the nation's new export goods?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face has got his license to break to sake renewed for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation intended for bio-public even in non-English speaking countries
He is of course the crazy secret agent, who, despite his bizarre claims for smoothieglamour, has received a little bit of Clouseau, a snitch Mr Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the Olympics in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international mystical man Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There are one or two nice moments in the latest JE movie
I loved it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and when the rotor blades for a short time struck his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is displayed, but the humor feels rather low-melted and strangely redundant, especially since the "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as an ingredient.
Humorn feels that it's suitable for children instead of adults and for me Johnny English is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film experiences in the role of Bean.
The constant issue now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super secret web network of spies, which reveals the identities of all Britain's agents out in the field, to the agent in his great displeasure - an extremely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last straw for a prime minister who is a poppy and hard-working figure, who already suffers from a complete collapse of his political popularity: Emma Thompson does her very best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but the script does not offer much to work on.
Her intelligence advisor informs her that when every individual active spy is busy, she must use someone who retired.
And that means the stuttering Johnny English in his own high person, now employed as a teacher in any well-paid institution, but offering unofficial lessons in the art to work undercover by the side of.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former long-lasting sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, a jolly-hockey-sticks-roll where Vicki Pepperdine is close to wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terribly wrong with Her Majesty's Secret Service and encounter Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister will fall hard on the charismatic tech billionaires, who claim he can solve Britain's computer break: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssé of farsacked riots: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle on the luxury boat of Volta; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to get acquainted with the inside of Volta's house.
It is certainly a lot of work behind the latter sequence, but although the film is both charming and fast-paced, it has an air of children's TV around it.
Pretty moderate everything.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can't help thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies that a plan is being drawn up for British work a four-day week but is being paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's party Labour is considering a radical plan that is that the British work a four-day week - but get paid for five.
According to the report, the party wants managers to hand over savings made by the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but keep the same salary.
According to sources, the idea of "passing" with the party's economic agenda to the benefit of the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by trade union organisation Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic changes.
A representative higher up in Labor told The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"This will not happen in one day, but a four-day working week is an endeavour that fits into the party's attitude to balance the economy in favour of the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, including the party The Greens who promised a four day working week during his election campaign in 2017.
However, this objective is not endorsed by Labour as a whole.
A spokesperson for Labour said: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and there is nothing the party agrees about."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "disgusting leaders" and "spinner" to state-owned companies.
It also means that the current shareholders of water companies cannot recover their entire stake, because a Labour Government can "reduction" due to what they perceive has been wrong documents.
He also confirmed plans to put employees in company boards and create "Inclusive Ownship Funds" where 10 per cent of the private company's own capital is left to its employees, which then stands to receive annual dividends of up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy in the television program "60 minutes" tell us whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their views.
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the Office's investigations might lead some Republican senators to change their position on the matter.
In an interview sent on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would lead to a change of mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went into the hearing, I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, the claim came out, and I said, "Have you done it?"
He was determined, convinced, unmistakable."
Graham's voice, however, seems unshakable.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamite fixation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all her names could not verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has a tremendously impressive display of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; to combat world poverty.
During its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to Central Parks Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event: to combat extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, according to a 2012 statement, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international preface group that hopes to fight poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if you were not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, ringing or in other meaningful ways contributing to raising awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it only about so-called "clickivism" - people who feel that they make a real difference by signing an online application or writing an online tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen states that more than 19 million "actions" have been recorded from its supporters who have fought for a variety of goals.
It says that these actions have helped to spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies that correspond to more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or funded.
The group estimates that the accumulated assets so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the UK between investors and stakeholders who are engaged in "helping children to develop to their full potential", promising to give Rwanda 35 million dollars to help fight malnutrition in the area after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British Government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can do social injustice that is subservient to history," said the ambassador to the Partnership Tracey Ullman to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 measures were taken requiring the UK to improve the diet of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes diet programmes targeted at 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the common questions on its website: "What makes you think that we can fight extreme poverty?"
Global citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monée are some of the artists present at this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use its fleet in a "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports stating the Minister for Home Affairs
The government can 'if necessary' resort its fleet to prevent Russian energy operators from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, has revealed the American Minister for Home Affairs Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it seems at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern parts of Europe," he said.
And according to him, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The US has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the maritime roads are kept open and, if necessary, to apply blockade, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to participants in the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an non-profit group calling themselves "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they were really the same ones.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "day-dish" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come after the Trump administration has been aiming to increase the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the much cheaper alternative for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 Pipeline project, which according to Trump made Berlin the Moscow "captain".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely financial project.
They argue that Washington's opposition to the project is only driven for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russia's energy minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was set back by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I strongly dislike the fact that a third party is disrupting our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, President of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Putin of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "probable thinker" if she is to stand in the presidential election in 2020," says Massachusetts Senator.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a "principal thinker" about her participation in the presidential election after the US interim election.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing as a candidate.
"It's time for women to get to Washington and fix our broken government and it includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I'm going to take a lot of thought to run to the president's post."
Warren weighed in on President Donald Trump during the council hall meeting and said that he "took this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does for our democracy," she said.
Warren has been unspeakable in his criticism of Trump and his candidate at the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own supporters did not believe that she would be able to do so by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "faithful" Massachusetts swallows said that the senator should not be candidated, according to a study conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other highly profiled democratic names discussed with respect to a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont’s Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he was to decide officially in January, reported Associate Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after taking his pick-up in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through now that he's back, I can relate to other families who have experience with PTSD and part of the trauma our soldiers return with," she told the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back like other people, they come back hard, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military, have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and accused of domestic violence against a woman, attempted to prevent a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in drunk state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, as well as the District of Columbia, support the questioning of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a trial against a new American policy that denies asylum to victims of gang-related violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted a Friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges the policy, NBC News reported.
Full name of the defendant in Grace v. Sessions submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the policy has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and his violent gang member sons" abused her, but American officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
States lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries producing a large number of asylum seekers, such as nations facing major problems with gangs and violence at home.
The new US asylum policy amended a 2014 decision by immigration authorities allowing illegal immigrants to seek asylum in order to escape domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignors decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a provision is contrary to that principle", according to the Friend-of-the-court report.
Lawyers further argued in the report that policies which deny the entry of immigrants harm the American economy and argue that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
In June, Minister for Justice, Jeff Sessions, ordered judges in asylum cases to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang violence.
"Asyl is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions when the policy was announced on June 11th.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems, including all the serious problems, that people face every day of the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the death rate doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation looked all darker.
"It feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted his jealous boy in a evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"Ambulance gets dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is scarce."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their ruined homes, rooted through water damaged possessions, and tried to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals injured in the 7.5 earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured persons, including Dwi Haris, who were hit by a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the hospital Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continued strong aftertreatment.
With tears of eyes, he told me that the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't run away.
I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, I think," told Haris to Associate Press and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of bullying with "propaganda ads"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper about the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the American ambassador to China accused Peking of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The United States President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily paying an allowance in Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's best selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to participate in the 6th Congress elections of the United States, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in American elections marked what American officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign from Washington intended to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war with increased tariffs on each other's imports.
China's recovery tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa, which supports Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador in China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, in a discussion article on Sunday Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote, “The bullying now doubles by putting propaganda ads into our own free press.”
"The Government of China makes use of America's dear tradition of freedom of expression and a free press to spread propaganda to by publishing paid advertising in Des Moines Register", wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, in the newsstand on the street here in Beijing, you will find a limited number of different voices and will not see any true reflection of the different opinions the Chinese people may have on China's troubled economy, because the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, "he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most distinguished newspapers nobbed the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which magazine.
Republicans scare away female voters in the run-up to the middle-year elections through the Kavanaugh Fiasco, warning analysts
Since many top republicans defend the nominees of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who is faced with several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a setback, especially from women, during the upcoming elections.
The feeling about this has been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the elections.
You cannot turn back the clock, says Grant Reeher, professor of Political Science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)' last attempt at an FBI investigation will suffice to reassure angry voters.
"Womans will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman of the progressive MoveOn group on Friday, according to Washington, DC newspaper.
On Friday morning they shook the protesting "November comes!" when they demonstrated in the hall to the Senate building when the Republicans controlling the Court Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go into the roof," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, to the news site.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among still indefinite female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford’s public testimony with allegations of sexual abuse against the nominees of the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a setback be followed if the Republicans pressed through the confirmation.
"This has become a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the Committee's vote or the final vote or if Kavanaugh comes through, it is also about how republicans have dealt with this and how they have dealt with her," said Guy Cecil, Head of Priorities United States, a group that helps democratic election campaigns, for the news channel.
But the Americans in general seem to be divided over who to believe in in in the wake of the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, and the latter seems to be the one they believe most in.
A new opinion poll from YouGov shows that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that they thought that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims of Ford, as did those of at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Justice Committee on oath last week that Kavanaugh violently attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court exposed his sex organs to her while they attended a party during their time as a student at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, World Wide Web inventor, launches a startup aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are given access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee ridiculed that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data great" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, to make lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all are available in a browser at the same time.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access which type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a number of software developers to work with the project and a group of volunteer coders.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are put on high edge overnight.
"We're not asking them for permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has in recent months been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
During the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new era on the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest rewarded with Viktoria cross during World War I is celebrated
The only priest in the Church of England who was rewarded with a Victoria cross during World War I is now celebrated in his home city 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his action during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had been awarded the British military's most prestigious prize.
A memorial stone was covered by his two grandchildren under a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brily symbolic," that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded with the prize.
According to London Gazette, Lt Col Vann on 29 September 1918 led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick mist and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the firing line and led with the "great bravery" line forward before he alone settled the battle.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "what I know I could never live up to, but something I'm very humble to."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also dropped a wreath after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "became very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "a genuine hero's resistance is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA fans stopped up all night to watch Bellator 206 and instead saw Greta Gris
Imagine this, you've stopped up all night to see Bellator 206 just to be denied watching the main event.
The show from San Jose included 13 games, including sex on the main card and was shown live at night in the UK on channel 5.
At 06:00, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the program suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were not impressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours of the morning to watch the game.
A fan on Twitter described the program change to a signed child program as "a sick joke".
"It was the government decision that the content was not suitable so early in the morning, so they had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's Vice President for Marketing and Communication when asked about the broadcast.
"Greta pig, yes"
Bellator's CEO Scott Coker said they will work with their scheduling to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we will be able to find a solution in terms of the reprice," said Coker.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the program changed upset a lot of people.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But that was actually a state question.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We will show five games instead of sex - as we normally do. We took water over our head in trying to satisfy fans.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "subtle" because of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt inferior to his comrades during his childhood because of his sexuality - but it also encouraged him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize he wasn't like everybody else until he went to high school."
When he spoke in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he talked about the rights of homosexuals to give others "hop".
He also said he cared less about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The regular programme leader of the popular show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off because of illness.
During his one-time performance on Laverne's first program, Daley tells how he felt "less worth" than others during his childhood, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "This feeling of feeling less worthy and feeling different has been a real source of power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so that he didn't betray everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The dual Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile advocate of HBT rights and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to convince more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without restrictions and wanted to give others "hop".
The threefold world champion said that his love of a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "came as a surprise".
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much in such a young age" - he participated in his first OS as a 14-year-old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his whole life perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was just about winning gold," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that Dad did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about was whether they got their tickets to the Olympics in London 2012 - where he wanted to sit on the first line.
"I couldn't tell him: you won't be able to sit on the front row of Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally admitted he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I only knew this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - diving in front of a home audience on an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song - Proud by Heather Small - a song that had followed him up to the Olympics and still gave him Russians.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench during Saturday’s Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he has to fix the shape to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's Fourballs and Foursomes.
Instead of being in the centre of events, as he has often been for the United States, the five-fold winner spent his day working cheerleaders and training at his game in the hope of getting a chance to show off his ability.
He has never been the straightest of drivers, not even at the top of his career and the 48-year-old is not in the shape of the tough track at Le Golf National, where the long ruff often punishes hard.
It is not only the course that discourages, in the ninth match on Sunday, the Mickelson Master Francesco Molinari, who, together with Novisa Tommy Fleetwood, has won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are under 4 points in front of the 12 single matches, have won at first, Mickelson's match can be absolutely crucial.
Fury expressed confidence in his player, not because he could say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on my back and put his arm around me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"His confidence is not wrong.
He is a celebrity and he has added so much to these teams in previous seasons and in the past week.
I probably didn't think he'd be able to play two games.
I thought he'd be able to do more, but now it's what it is, and we'll have to settle for it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
On Sunday Mickelson passed Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never completely lived up to the heights of his individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk said that his presence brought other qualities the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, quick, likes to joke with people and he's a good guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds so much more than just gambling."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can soon be a memory of nothing but a memory.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in last day's singles in Ryder Cup can quickly change into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team under Seve Ballestero's management held a five-point advantage over the Americans but finally won with the lowest margin with the result 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You remember that we led big on Valderrama, we led big on Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with distress and nagging," said Bjorn (in the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and leading with 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will prove to me and everyone in the team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow we'll give everything.
Goes out and does everything right.
This isn't over until we see the score on the board.
Our goal is to try to win this trophy and that is where our focus lies.
I've said it all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we're well aware of what's waiting on the other side - the best players in the world."
Björn was satisfied with his players' achievements on a tough golf course and added: "I would never manage this myself.
Tomorrow, new challenges lie ahead.
Tomorrow, it is the individual achievements that apply, and that is a completely different matter.
It's nice to be out with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there on your own, your ability as a golfer is tested fully.
It's the message you need to convey to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he must also go and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Björn, opponent Jim Furyk will want players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who made home three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of great conversions during the last days in a contest, both in the winning team in Brookline before he ended as losers when Europe drove "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in response when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, Captain in 1999, had gathered his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but one would like to go out as quickly as on Brookline, as on Medinah.
When the pace starts one way, there will be a lot of pressure on these middle matches.
We did our show and placed the guys we wanted to, you know, create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight and meeting Rory McIllroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it's enough all the way," Bjorn said about his single choices.
Germany's new warship is being postponed again
The newest frigate of the German fleet would have been launched in 2014 to replace warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will not be launched until at least next year due to incorrect systems and high costs, reported local media.
The launch of "Rheinland-Palatinate", the new Baden-Wuerttemberg Fregat, has now been postponed up to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel should have joined the fleet as early as 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery were disastrous for the ambitious project.
The four ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the fleet ordered in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen fleets.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a series of air defence and maritime missiles, as well as certain sneak techniques, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the newest frigates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But constant delays mean that the groundbreaking warships - which allow Germany to project power abroad - are already obsolete when they are put into service, says Die Zeit.
The fateful F125 Bracket created headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship in operation and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the fleet returned a ship to a ship builder after delivery.
A little was known about the causes of the return, but German media listed a number of important "software and hardware errors" that made the warship useless if used on a battle mission.
The lack of software was particularly important because ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a staff of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older frigates in the Bremen class.
It was also found that the ship has a significant overweight, resulting in impaired performance and limiting the marine capacity to perform future upgrades.
The 7,000 tonnes of heavy "Rheinland-Palatinate" is assumed to be twice as heavy as similar vessels used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from incorrect hardware, the entire project price tag - including crew training - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have been staggering EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - compared to EUR 2.2 billion at the start stage.
Problems affecting the newest frigates become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is being reduced.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the fleet actually "should have a shortage of fully equipped vessels".
The official said that this was a growing problem because old ships were dismantled but no replacement vessels were provided.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust Thieving Lights to the Secret Life of Flocking
New research carried out on a property in the highlands of Scotland aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help control future conservation activities.
The study, by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the South and Dwarf Piistrell as well as brown loaned and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special players will be placed in important places around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat sounds and which species do what.
A natural environment map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area view of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS nature conservation advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest fields for bats and other related species.
Flatdermus populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by building and development work that affects the nest and the loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting may also pose a risk, as well as aircraft and certain chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as house cat attacks.
The bats are not really blind.
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated eco-location technology to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
The organisation has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct investigations, examine bons and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threeave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home for eight of Scotland's ten bats.
David Thompson, property manager, says the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here at Threeave we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and a variety of favorable habitats.
But there is a lot about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to understand more about what they need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of searching for bats before carrying out maintenance within properties, as it is possible that accidental destruction of a single nest could kill up to 400 females and young people, and possibly destroy an entire population.
The bats are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, bother or disturb them or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are feeling."
Ronaldo rejects rape sentence while his lawyers threaten to sue the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape charges against him "false news" and says that people "will market themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus foreward have been accused of having raped an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He said he paid her 375,000 dollars to keep quiet about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live video on Instagram, Ronaldo (33) turned off the reports as "false news" when he spoke to his 142 million followers, just hours after the demands were reported.
"No no no no.
What they said today was false news," said the five-fold Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything good," said the player and smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for claims, which they have called "an unauthorised reporting of suspicions of integrity", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "mortal injury to an amount equal to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged event is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her anal, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 per cent" a "good guy" betrayed by the "last percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was with consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed on a conciliation because she felt "fear of retribution" and was worried about "becoming humiliated publicly".
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to cancel the settlement because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: UK "will forever regret" to lose car manufacturers
Great Britain "will regret it forever" if you lost your status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Minister of Business Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "oothing" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement they will temporarily stop production at the Burnaton factory, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event of no agreement being concluded could result in lost jobs.
The Burnaston factory - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stops in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota at Burnaton.
Other British car manufacturers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems relate to what car manufacturers say are the risks to the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without settlement.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for ordered cars.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, this could lead to disruption at the border, as the industry says can lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's consumption in storage at its Derbyshire plant, said the company, and thus production would be forced to stop.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequer's plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We need a deal. We want the best agreement that enables, as I say, not only success at present to be appreciated now, but for us to seize this opportunity." he said to BBC Radio 4:s program Today.
"The statements from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supplier chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that increased costs would reduce plant competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaton for 24 years and is the leader of the Unite Trade Union at the factory, said his members are increasingly worried: "My experience is that these jobs never come back.
A government official said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "proceeded for another week" while the fight against the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, connections between Trump and Russia and the President's potential obstacle to justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Justice Minister, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington caves for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing interception equipment to record conversations with Trump as well as the possibility of deposed the President via the 25th Amendment of the American Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But Monday he went to the White House, and reports that he was about to leave came.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, then at the UN headquarters in New York, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" to not kick Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's judicial committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual irregularity, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date for it has not been set, it can happen this week, or a delay by one week, given all the other things that happen at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would contest the claim: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since September 10.
The values Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to any disapproval of TV reporters as "playing for the gallery", although she said: "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President is holding more questions than any President before him," she said, allowing without quoting proof: "We've looked at these figures."
Conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and it will replace press conferences, and then you can ask the President of the United States directly."
Trump responds regularly to questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances before the assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU employees at NHS Scotland, taking into account concerns about Brexit
The Minister for Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the cost of discontinued status applications for EU citizens working in the country's decentralised public sector.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on exits have continued, with decisions expected to come in autumn.
However, the UK Government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I value the efforts of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after he has suffered head injury
Tennessee State Tiger's lineback Christion Abercrombie went through an emergency operation after having suffered a head injury in Saturday's loss by 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Reed told the reporters that the injury occurred just before half an hour.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before being placed on a stretcher for further evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie operated at the hospital Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no data on the type/case of the injury yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second year student redshirt, is in her first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which gave him a season total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers are allowed to pay higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK, and the extra money is used to help homeless people, according to Tory Party's new plans
The action will neutralise Corbyn’s successes in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp duty will apply to those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The UK Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to GBP 120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help homeless people, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn’s successes in attracting young voters with promises of housing at more affordable prices and aiming at high income earners.
The increase in stamping tax will be levied on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money will give a boost to the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee is higher than the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in residential and residential homes purchased for rent. It may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will withdraw up to GBP 120 million per year.
An estimated 13 per cent of the newly built properties in London are bought by people living outside the UK, driving prices up and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot on the housing market.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new bet comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the stamp tax to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to renounce allowances on housing with affordable prices to solve Britain's "needed housing situation."
Jeremy Corbyn has launched a spectacularly sufficient proposal for housing reform, including rent cap and an end to evictions without the tenant's delay.
He also wants to give municipalities greater opportunity to build new housing.
Theresa May says: "Last year I said I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, that life will be better for every new generation.
This means solving the problems in the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and also for companies based abroad, to buy homes as for hardworking residents in our country.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become just a distant dream, and homelessness is still an unworthy fact."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to train Scotland"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his "final goal" is to eventually become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old shots look forward to the challenge of blowing life in the club from northeastern England, currently located on third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a game in the B-country team and that's all," says Ross to the BBC Scotland Sportsound.
"But as I grew up, I looked a lot at Scotland at Hampden with my dad, and it has always attracted me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage to lead a club."
Among Ross’s representatives are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says he was not worried about succeeding such a established name in such a large club. He has previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Just now I assess success based on the answer to the question 'Can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
This club is definitely home to the Premier League, given its structure and talents," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably just see myself as a success here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a period of assisting coaching in Dumbarton and a 15-month-long season as a member of Heart's training team.
Then he helped Alloa get back from moving back to the third division, and lifted St. Mirren from being near moving down to becoming the winner of the championship title the following season.
Ross says he's more satisfied now than ever during his gambling career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a fork," he recalls and refers to when he took command of Alloa.
"I really thought leadership was right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had okay results and could live properly on it. In addition, I had some great successes.
But playing can be tough.
There's a lot to get through every week.
It's still stress and pressure at work for me, but training feels absolutely right.
I always wanted to practice and now I do. I feel better than I have ever done throughout my adult life."

A survey shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
Summer's heat wave has raised revenues for the country's struggling pubs, but restaurant chains have got more pressure on.
Figures showed that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of the CGA company, which has compiled the figures, said: "Continued beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in the World Cup longer than expected meant that we saw a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the pubs went up by 2.8%. However, the restaurants got even greater difficulties.
The decrease in restaurant turnover by 1.8% in June only got worse in July.
Pubar and bars offering drinks above all showed the very best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pubar that offers food also had difficulties in the beautiful weather, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People just seem to have wanted to go out and drink something.
The cost of managed pubs and bars went up by 6.6% that month and food sales by 3%."
Paul Newman at the service and entertainment business analyst RSM says: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sporting events are still the most important factors in the sale of the large kitchen market.
It is no surprise that the restaurant groups still have difficulties, although a sales reduction of 4.8% each year is particularly difficult to deal with in addition to the current cost pressure.
The long warm summer could not have come more inconvenient for companies driven by food sales. Time may show if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August give a well-needed resipt."
The total sales increase in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2,7 % in July. It reflects the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
The industry sales supervisor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub bar and restaurant industry in the UK collects and analyses data on how 47 active groups are doing with a combined turnover of over GBP 9 billion, and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
An investigation shows that one of five children, sometimes as young as 11 years old, has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students shows an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
The result has increased concerns about sexual content being put up there.
20% of students said they had a "main account" that they showed to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, creates social media accounts that they keep secret to adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school and high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta Accounts", a reference to Instagram image sharing service.
As a result, concerns about the fact that sexual content is being posted there have been raised.
20% of students said they have a clean "main account" that they can show to their parents, and so they also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled over her 13-year-old daughter's secret side found a teenager who urged others to "sold me."
According to the study, carried out by the organisations Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools, 40% of children between 11 and 18 years had two profiles, and half of them acknowledged that they had private accounts.
The president of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to creating places on the internet where parents and teachers do not find them."
Eilith Doyle will be the "voke of athletes" in the board of the Scottish Free sports League, Scottish Athletics
Elidh Doyle has been elected to the Swedish Athletics Board as an external board member at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most prized free sportsman, and President Ian Beattie describes the choice as an outstanding opportunity for those who lead sport to benefit from her wide experience at international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh has gained great respect throughout the entire Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that the sports in Scotland would benefit greatly from becoming a member of the board," said Beattie.
Doyle says: "I would like to be a voice for the athletes and I hope that I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The Americans, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, have a total of four Olympic gold and are now expert commentator at the BBC. He lost the ability to go for a mini-stroke.
He writes on Twitter: "Today a month ago I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that the time had to show if I would recover, and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I have recovered completely, learned to walk again and now I do mobility exercises!
Thank you for all your encouragement!"
Adverters for breast pumps comparing mothers with cows share the internet
A company that sells breast pumps has caused disagreements on the internet with a advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers with cows that are being milked.
To draw attention to the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent portable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie released a music video-inspired advertising film with humorous coatings to show what freedom the new pump gives mothers as pumps of breast milk.
Four real moms dance in a stuffed barn with cows to a song with lines of text like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you didn't know that, this is no jewel, but tits."
"Pum up, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the advertising film, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused fights on the internet.
The film has received 77 000 shows and hundreds of comments, and has met mixed reactions from the viewers. Many say it sheds light on the dairy industry's "phases".
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Just like we, they have to become pregnant and feed in order to produce milk, but their babies are taken away from them only a few days after birth", writes one person.

Another comments: "You understand that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But certainly, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another adds: "What real-world advertising films."
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is "hysterically fun."
"I think this is brilliant.
I'd have gotten one if I still had a grandmother.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product," someone writes.
Another comments: "This is a fun commercial film that addresses mothers as pumps (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feels like kisses."
This isn't a film that celebrates or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, women reveal that they've all danced with the discreet pump stuffed in brahån.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no cables or pipes and can be worn discreetly in a nursing box, giving women freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin is a partner and ECD at Mother, and she says: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women who pumps breast milk and milk cows, we wanted to shed light on breast pumping and the challenges with it, while, in a entertaining and recognisable way, showing the incredible sense of freedom the new pump gives.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump creates headlines.
During London's fashion week, a two-child mother appeared on the catwalk with clothes of designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrants moved quietly to a tent camp near the Texas border.
The number of children who have been deprived of liberty has increased, even though the number of people crossing the border each month is relatively unchanged, partly due to the fact that Turkish rhetoric and hard politics introduced by the Government of Trump have made it more difficult to place the children with reference persons.
In the past, most of the reference persons themselves have been paperless immigrants, and fear to risk their own ability to stay in the country by declaring themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult household members would have to leave fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of persons who had applied for reference to minors.
The Authority subsequently confirmed that 70 % of those arrested were not known by law enforcement authorities earlier.
"Almost 80% of those who are either reference persons or family members of reference persons are illegally present in the country, and a large part of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to persecute these individuals," said Albence.
In order to deal with children’s cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to be brought into court within one month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, as previously was practice, according to staff at the premises.
Many of them are present on video links rather than in person to bring their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those not deemed to be entitled to protection are deported rapidly.
The longer children are deprived of liberty, the more likely they are to suffer anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to staff at the centres and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Proponents say that concerns are rising at large facilities like Tornillo, where signs that a child is in trouble are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the facility.
They add that if children are moved to the tent town without having enough time to prepare emotionally and say goodbye to friends, the traumas that many already wrestle with may worsen.
Syria demands that American, French and Turkish "occupation forces" withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that the Government of Damascus would continue to "fight this holy blow until we have freed all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 Syrian soldiers, who primarily train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1 000 soldiers on the ground in the war - torn country.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances were good enough for them to come home, and accused "some Western countries" of "dispersing irrational fear" that would enable refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They're policing something that should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to conclude the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last great rebel mount Idlib has created an opportunity to proceed with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement led to a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "transparent deadlines", and expressed the hope that military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaida-linked Nusrafront, who will "be wiped out".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government members and members of the opposition, to make a draft post-war Constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee and said that the group's work would be limited to "the revision of the articles of the current Constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the re-election 2020 unless his presidency ended early through national law and scandal, which many liberal viewers are likely to hope for.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!"
Currently, there is no sign that the viewers have become tired.
Since 2014, the viewing figures for best broadcast time have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and are almost three times high, 1.6 million, on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on best broadcast time, which is an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has topped the lists for cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers during great news nights.
"This is like a fire that people are drawn to, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC's drama "Designed Survivor", dealing with a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed Capitolium.
Nell Scovell is a long-standing composer and has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club". She has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the elections in 2016.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Donald Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh," Nell Scovell tells me.
In the chaos there is an entertainment value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the Washington reporting can determine the future of the case of abortion, Roe vs Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunified and the well-being of the global economy.
Shutting down is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one has suddenly sat and looked for six hours at an expert panel debating Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" to his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of ostriches for 15 000 dollars ("a garment filled with hybris", as the Washington Post said) and the meaning of Stormy Daniel's macabre descriptions of Donald Trumps, hm, anatomy.
I myself will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"A part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality series is that he comes with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump follower's rotating role crew and daily intriger (wow fight with NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).

When I spoke to the TV producer Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sun and 27 degrees outside his house in northern Kauai in Hawaii, but he sat up and woke up indoors watching MSNBC while recording a transmission from CNN.
He could not wear himself out, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be put before the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in the balance.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the fairest race ever before the mid-year elections
It is not surprising that the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania receives a lot of money. It is thanks to a restructuring of a Congress district that has made two members now compete for the same place.
This newly rewritten suburbs in Pittsburgh are represented by the democrat Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district at a special elections last spring.
Lamb campaigning against another member, Republican Keith Rothfus. He currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were rewritten after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were constitutionally changed to the advantage of republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has caused a campaign finance dispute between the main parties' economic sections, Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and National Republic Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a button win in a widely watched special selection in March to Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That place had been held by a republic for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts had given some headway to the democrats.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for China aid but then backing
Diplomater noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with a little resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's president Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama, until the partners won the Trump organisation's leader team.
Officials of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs decided to call home the heads of the U.S. missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "news decided to no longer recognise Taiwan", said the Minister's spokesman Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017. Among other things, money would go to drug control and development and provide financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
While the internal meetings continued, US and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
However, in mid-September high administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which actually put an end to considerations of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which will now take place in mid-October. It is a sign of the importance of the presidential administration’s view of the meeting, said the diplomats.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson for John Bolton from the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate, described by the three American officials, of whom two diplomats agreed to discuss internal negotiations against anonymity promises.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also made himself anonymous.
Study History
The next inevitable steps can be the special investigator Robert Mueller's report on Donald Trump's alleged abuse in legal matters, for which there is now tangible evidence in public records.
Mueller is also reported to run his investigation against whether Donald Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in its attacks on the US election.
If Congress were to change the majority, Trump would be held accountable to that congregation just as he prepares to stand up again in the elections, and perhaps finally to a citizen’s jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to say that Trump will inevitably fall, so also his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how the extract the fight can be.
1938 German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the Western countries had stood against him and stood behind the Czechoslovaks of Munich.
We failed, missing an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath that followed.
History revolves around such crucial events, and the unrelenting progress of democracy is either speeded up or slowed down.
The Americans are now facing a number of these crucial events.
What should we do if Donald Trump gives Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what is going to happen to Mueller's investigation, fired?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this magazine reported that last year he will have proposed to secretly record the president, and speculated that he would not be suitable for the office.
Rosenstein says the Times reporting isn't right.
"How should we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he is allowed to appear in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we in the mid-year elections vote in a congress that holds Donald Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, democracy faces a dark period.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Slovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath light on the table decorated with the hook cross.
With that as an inheritance, how could I be anything but an optimism about the future?"

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is optimist before the meeting with Rapid Wien
The Rangers welcome Rapid Wien on Thursday. They know that victory against the Austrians after the impressive Spain match against the Villarreal that ended unquestionably earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, up to the 2-match against Villaarreal. However, he believes that Rangers can use the result as a springboard against greater success.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," says 31-year-old.
"We went into the game in the belief that we could get something, and went away with a point.
Perhaps we could have gotten it in at the end, but in general it was probably a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half, and we got back in the second half, and it was the better team.
Thursday is going to be an important night in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough match. They got a good result at their last match, but if we have the audience with us, we can probably get a good result.
Last year was very tough, with everything that happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The stairs are good and the guys are having fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put the last season behind us and succeed."
Women sleep badly because of fear of pension savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear picture of how they wanted to be taken care of, few people talked to their family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the national study said that they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they do not take the step and talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how you start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to give you care if you do not tell them how you want it in good time.
Work with your advisor and your family and discuss where and how you want care. Your choices may have a major impact on costs.
Get help from your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance solution, a hybrid life-care solution with cash value to cover the costs, or a self-insurance solution with own resources, if you can afford.
Legal acts: Avoid legal disputes from the start.
Set up a medical authority so that you can appoint a trusted person who looks after your medical care and make sure that the health care professionals follow your wishes, if you become unable to communicate.
Consider also a warrant for your economy.
You then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in your place and make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable to do it yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who ends up in an emergency medical condition and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready.
"It's not just the economy that's at stake, but who's the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What drugs is that?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure your plan is ready."
You shot several times with air rifles in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with air rifles as he walked home from night to night.
The victim, who is in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police describe the shooting, which took place about 02:30, as a "successful incident".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The damage is not life threatening, and the police are calling on Witnesses to make their calls.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday. It states officials. The death rate is expected to rise.
The communications are down, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to get any information from the Donggala management area, a region north of Palu that is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
More than 16 000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the main city of Centrala Sulawesi, located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city’s population was estimated at 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a management area extending along more than 300 km of the coast of the north-west Sulawesi.
The administrative area, which is an administrative region under a province, had a population estimated at 299 200 people in 2017.
The aid pillars of the central Sulawesi economy are fisheries and agriculture, particularly the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last hundred years, according to Indonesia’s disaster management authority.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996 Western Dongala was also hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Circumpacifian Seismic lightning, which is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries. 226 000 people died along the Indian Ocean coasts. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the West coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale hit south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 hit near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Västra Sumatra.
More than 1 100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands outside of Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten meters was triggered. Thousands of villages were destroyed and around 300 people were killed.
2016: A basic earthquake affected the Pidie Jaya management area in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and the tsunami 2004.
This time, no tsunami triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok. More than 500 people died, most on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaska Governor and vice-president Sarah Palin, has been arrested for abuse.
Palin, who is 29 years old and from Wasilla in Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence, for engaging in a report on domestic violence and for resisting arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he should have taken the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody of the Mat-Su enforcement and is held against the $500 bail to be paid if the suspect violates the bail terms, according to the KTUU television channel.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "not guilty" when he was asked to state his position, according to the television channel.
Palin is suspected of three cases of less serious crimes under Class A, which means that he may be imprisoned for up to a year and $250,000 fined.
He has also been accused of a case of less serious crimes under Class B, which is punished with one day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
It's not the first time Palin's been accused of crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now handled by Alaska's veteran court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of having engaged in the notification of domestic violence and of possession of arms under influence in connection with that event.
His girlfriend accused him of beating her face.
Sarah Palin received criticism of veteran groups in 2016 after she had linked her son's violent behaviour to post-traumatic stress syndrome, which originated from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity and communications are down, and death figures are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside the centre of Sulawesi, located northeast of the capital of Indonesia Jakarta.
Movies that show when it hit the crowd are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are claiming a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York City
The New York federal prosecutor claims the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. It is a rare sentence that has not been carried out for a federal offence in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, must have used a rental car from the Home Depot building and interior chain to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in the lower Manhattan. He measuring pedestrians and cyclists in his way at the attack, which took place in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, the prosecutors had to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical injury, according to the declaration of intent on the death penalty lodged in Southern District in New York.
Both charges may be a death sentence, according to the court file.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged by a 22-point federal jury, including eight cases of murder to support protective activities, which are often used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as the abuse and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "wide planning and intent", said the prosecutors, and described at the same time the way Saipov performed it as "disgusting, cruel and inhuman".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage and loss", says in the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York’s southern territory has not been indicted in a case in which the death penalty is claimed in a decade.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murder by two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced to espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The pair Rosenberg was both executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed a lack of regret in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators he was happy with what he had done.
According to the charges, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack after watching IS movies on his phone.
He also asked for the IS flag to be placed in his hospital room, reported the police.
He has declared himself not guilty of the 22 charges in the prosecution.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders who represent Saipov. He stated that they are “forgive disillusioned” on the prosecution side’s decision.
"We believe that the decision to insist on the death penalty instead of going to life imprisonment without the possibility of conditional release if the defendant admits himself guilty only prolongs the trauma that these events have caused to all those involved," said Patton.
Saipov's team of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
MEPs from Tories say that NIGEL FARAGE should be given responsibility for the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the army of the people" today during a protest at Torie's conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians had to "feel the heat" from the EU scepters when one of Theresa May's own MEPs suggested that he should lead negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Member Peter Bone said at the march in Birmingham that Britain would have already "disappeared" if Nigel Farage had been the Secretary of State for Brexit.
But the challenge facing Theresa May to reconcile the deeply divided people has been exacerbated by EU-positive tory members, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers agreement, alive under the attack of Brexitan hangers, people who want to stay in the Union and Europe itself.
Her allies have insisted that she should press and try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the backsliding, and force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "kaos".
Bone said at a mass meeting organized by the Leave Means Leave organization in Solihull that he wanted to "spola Chequers Agreement".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and given responsibilities in negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stood at the helm, we would have been out by now," he said.
Peter Bone, representing the Wellingborough district in this House, added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we must wash the Chequers agreement."
He clarified his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world wars to become subjects.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone dismissed the allegations that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British would have changed and now want to remain is completely untrue."
Brexitan hanger Andrea Jenkyls from the Tory Party was also in the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say, 'The Prime Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is unpopular for the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular for the party and for our election workers who are on the streets and make sure we are elected.
Put down the Chequers deal and start listening."
And she added a sharp message to Theresa May: "Prime Ministers may retain their jobs when they keep their promises."
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that politicians have to "know the heat" if they were to betray the decision that was made with the referendum in 2016.
"Now it is about confidence between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, 'We won't let you get away with it.'"
In the face of the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is close to betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilising the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-steering and proud UK."
At the same time, EU officials marched through Birmingham and held a two-hour mass meeting in the city centre.
A group of activists waved with tracks with the text "Tory members against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
The Labour MP Lord Adonis from the House of Lords mocked the conservatives for the security issues they encountered with a party app when the conference opened.
"It is these people who say they can have IT systems in place and all the technologies for Canada plus plus plus, for friction-free borders and free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a pure father's.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren's planning a "wordful thinker" to run for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to get a "principal thinker about candidating to the president's post" after the November elections.
Boston Globe magazine reports that the Social Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about their future during a town hall meeting in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticised President Donald Trump, and now stands for re-election in November against the Republican state representative Geoff Diehl, who was Deputy Chairman of Donald Trump's campaign in Massachusetts 2016.
She's been the object of speculation that maybe she's getting on Donald Trump 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th town hall meeting with the voters since Donald Trump took place.
A person asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government.
One person arrested for the death of basketball player Sims from LSU
The Baton Rouge police announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The police in Baton Rouge announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 for ET.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to get help in identifying a man seen on the pictures.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot to death near Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and finally died of this," said Police Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday via the news site 247 sports.
Wayde went from time to time to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he had been on the scene and had a gun, and he admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any incidents and taken to the police station in East Baton Rouge.
Sims was junior player, 198 cm long and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 starting last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after team orders gave him profit over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtery Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it was clear that Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton on the tork when defending his position during the first two yards, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went in the pit first and let Hamilton drive into the back of the cluster, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes went in a row later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward for a little wheel-mot-wheel-action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free with the risk of having to bid in place after a double pull to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstapp started in the rear row and was seven at the end of the first yard on its 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race and held the tires to reach a quick finish and drive around Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
In the end, he entered the 44th depot but failed to speed up during the remaining eight yards when Raikkonen went up in fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job and got one and one," said Hamilton.
Real Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday because she maintains that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated judge of the Supreme Court, is accused of sexual abuse.
The president, who spoke at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly raise the testimony from Ford before the Senate Justice Committee. Instead, he commented that what went on in the Senate showed that people were "elaka, nasty and lying."
"The only thing that could happen and the fine thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry, mean, nasty and lying," he said.
"You see press releases and leaks and they say, 'No, I didn't.
I didn't do it.
Remember?
Did you leak, Diane Feinstein?
Remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it.
Wait a minute.
"If we've leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything," he added, and imitated the senator.
The letter with details of Ford's charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have come from her office.
"I haven't darkened Ford's accusations, I haven't leaked her story," said Feinstein to the committee according to The Hill newspaper.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential as she wished."
But her dementi doesn't seem to have fit the president, who during Saturday night's meeting commented on it like this: "I'll tell you something.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continues to support the candidate for the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual crimes by three women, and he suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to withdraw power with all the necessary means.
They don't care who they harm, who they have to run over to gain power and control," said the president of the digital news site Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars probed Friday's loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Belfast Giants received an early two - end lead through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie signed up for the home team before Dwyer restored Belfast Giant's lead.
Francois Bouchard acknowledged for Dundee before two goals from Luke Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season of Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind and hit Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season for the two teams, and Belfast Giants had won the three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave assistance when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the intensive first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie, who signed at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Belfast Giants was in charge at the first break when he scored his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard signed off once again with a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, and he secured the profit with his team's fifth half-way through the end period.
Belfast Giants, who has now lost four of his last five games, will play at home against Milton Keynes at his next match on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died because hundreds of people on a plane could escape an earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia is now hailed as a hero after he died as he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people on board could lift safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful earthquake continues to plague the area and many are stuck in the bridge of the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild swimming control tower at the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was on the runway, could lift safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was going to crash.
He later died in a hospital.
The speaker of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of people's lives, according to the Australian television channel ABC News.
"We arranged a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a major hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We are offended to hear this," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the death rate can rise to more than a thousand people. The country’s emergency aid authorities say that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death rate is believed to continue to increase because there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been able to reach", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the Authority.
Up to six meters high waves have ruined Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in help and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with dead bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Minimarkets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help survivors, but we do not know what they will be met by there.
This is already a tragedy, but it may get much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing after an airplane crashed in a lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia, the Pacific Ocean, now states that one man is missing. Previously it was said that all 47 passengers and the crew had been evacuated from the sinking plane and were safe.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer the questions about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crews after the plane crashed into the water when it tried to land at the airport in the Chuuk Islands.
Officials reported on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and what the course of events looked like.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane slipped past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane flew in very low.
"It's extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to wade through waist - deep water to the emergency exits on the falling plane.
He said that the cabin crew panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to develop a shipyard also helped rescue by using an inflatable boat to drive people ashore before the plane fell into the 30 - meter - deep water.
Data from Aviation Safety Network show that 111 persons have died in accidents involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analysts draw up a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution's page closed its post in the second trial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
The US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used mobile phone lists to kiss together the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers movements that night she died.
Rowlett said that he had received location information from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers that night she died, which contradicts his earlier claims, reported the news newspaper The Clarion Ledger.
When the information showed that his cell phone was with Chamber's cell phone during the time he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis said the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "holy, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis indicated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks after she died.
Mobile phone lists showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He blurted her out of his life," Hale said.
The defence is scheduled to begin its closing speech on Sunday.
The judge said he was expecting the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hiphop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that hip hops have come far from their origins in political messages and to tackle social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently gained a boost in Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
A black again?
A baby girl in New York is in a couple due to dismissal after a "racist" text message
A baby girl in New York is a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a mishandled text message from the mother who complained that she was "a black again".
The couple deny that they would be racists and compare the mood with "press."
The two-child mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed horror when she realized that the new nanny Giselle Maurice was black when she came to her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEY NOT A SVART IGEN", wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to his husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "little to mind", and gave Maurice the kick, claiming that their former nanny, an African American, had done a bad job and that she instead expected a Filipino woman, according to New York Post.
Maurice got paid for a day's work and was sent home in a taxi.
Now she is suing the couple to be compensated for the dismissal. She asks for compensation in the amount of $350 a day for the job she was initially employed to do, which would be for six months and where she would stay with the couple. However, she did not have a contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that," she said to the New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple repudiate the allegations that they were going to be racists and say that the only thing that was straight was to terminate Giselle Maurice's employment. They were worried that they couldn't trust her when they had insulted her.
"My wife had sent her something that she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said husband Joel Plasco to New York Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone whom you would have been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously."
Plasco compared the atmosphere with "press" and said that his wife would give birth two months later and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Do you want to go after someone like that?
It's not very nice done", allowed the investment bank Plasco.
The legal process is still ongoing, but public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticises them for their behaviour and reasoning.
Paddington publishers didn't think that readers could relate to a talking bear, reveal a new letter
Paddington author Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, commented: "It's hard to imagine what it was like for a person who read it for the first time before it was released.
It's very funny, given what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She told me that her father, who had worked as a cameraman at the BBC before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60-year anniversary of the first release was "bitterly" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family," adding that her father was proud in silence of his final success.
"He was quite quiet, and no boastful person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who manages something. You become proud of the child even though it is not you who have done it.
I think he saw Paddington's successes a little bit like that.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he would always give Paddington his own glory."
My daughter was going to die, and I got to say goodbye on the phone
When she landed, her daughter had been taken en route to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it was really bad, and you didn't expect her to make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The drugs that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly ebbed out and left her body.
She had died just before and now everything was turned off.
I just had to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I couldn’t talk or scream or cry, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, went aboard the plane with the other passengers, who were fully unaware of the difficult trial she was going through.
"No one knew about it," she said.
"I bent my head down, and tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sleeping women set up postcards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that you can call to get support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and he took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel as bad as I do every day," she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydia, and she tells me that her son was a promising chef who had a contagious smile.
"Everybody knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smiling brightened up the room."
But he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his sibling after he had killed himself in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I keep worrying about consequences."
Sharon Davis created the cards "for people to know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet, talk about it."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been a friend of Sharon Davies for years, lost his partner since 15 years, Mark, some time after his mother's death.
"He hadn't said that he felt depressed or depressed or anything," she says.
"Some days before Christmas we noticed that he behaved differently.
On Christmas Day, he was at the bottom, and when the kids opened their Christmas gifts, he didn't have eye contact with them or anything."
She says his death was a very hard blow to them, but they have to get through it."It rips up a wound in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI initiates investigation
"I thought that if we could achieve something similar to what he asked for - an investigation limited in time and scope - maybe we could get some agreement," said Jeff Fllake on Saturday. He added that he feared that the Committee would be "divided" because of deeply rooted differences between parties.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican followers want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their stubbornness depends entirely on the timing.
The interim elections will take place in just five weeks, on November 6th. If the Republicans make a bad choice, which is expected, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the one they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called Senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was personally secretary to George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Deputy President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and confirm his election in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean droppers "Sunker" under Kim
The number of North Koreans jumping off to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, who quotes data from South Korea's Ministry of Reconciliation, says that 1 127 people left last year, compared with 2 706 in 2011.
Park says that tougher border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher charges for smugglers are important reasons.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Finally, the vast majority of North Korea's shoppers are offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30 000 North Koreans have been crossing the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them fly through China, which is bordered by North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Korea states.
China sees it as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends it back violently.
The North-South relationship, which is technically still at war with each other, has greatly improved over the last few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met for talks focusing on the accelerated nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work for the Korean Peninsula to be free of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused American sanctions of the lack of success since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we can absolutely not disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Ri at a speech in the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterically," and says that he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
The mining director in the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric" and said that he was temperally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosis comments came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like that, she would be called 'hysterical'," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the allegations of having sacrificed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotionally touched, and from time to time he screamed almost and his voice started talking about his family and his years in high school.
He also expressly condemned the democrats in the committee, saying that the accusations against him were a "grotesian and coordinated character murder" organised by Liberals who were angry about Hillary Clinton losing the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she felt that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was partial to the disadvantage of democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way in which he attacked the couple Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh before the national court if he was elected, and if the Democrats were to receive a majority in the Representative House.
"I can say this – if he does not tell Congress or the FBI, then he is not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he is at now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. appeal court.
Pelosi added that she as a democrat was concerned about what decisions Kavanaugh might have to take against the Health Insurance Act Affordable Care Act or the abortion case Roe vs. Wade, because he is considered to be a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether to amend certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not the time for a hysterical and partial person to sit in court and expect us all to applaud," said Pelosi.
Women have to stand out.
It is a righteous criticism, months and years of anger that boils over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Ms. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual.
And she continued: "I got good help from a woman who was CEO somewhere. She said that she also cried when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she spoke to: 'You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry.
And so she went on.
I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed to get out of anger partly because they are often misunderstanded.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, where I once cried out of indescribable anger, was that I was taken into the collar by an older woman. It was a chilly boss that I had always been a bit afraid of, and she pulled me into a stairwell.
"Let them never see you crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sorry and they're happy that they managed to press you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder considered that there was no reason not to investigate the idea of himself standing in the presidential elections.
"It wasn't a well thought out decision," she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since she was late out, she was behind with the money collection, and promised not to go in as a candidate if she didn't get 2 million dollars.
It was a project condemned to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in a speech that she would not launch a formal presidential election campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and anger to sexualism, that the voice lasted.
"One might have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schröder recalls the reactions of the press.
"One might have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, 'What are they gonna write on my gravestone?'
'She cried?'
Why the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The opening stage of the trade war between the United States and China was deafening. The war is far from over, but the crack between countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by evidenceing important Chinese export goods such as solar panels, steel and aluminium with customs duties.
The most important escalation came this week, with new tariffs on goods for $200 billion, which means in practice that half of all goods entering the United States from China are customsed.
Peking has every time responded with the same coin. Recently, charges of between five and ten per cent on American goods were dropped for $60 billion.
China has promised to match US action, and the world's second largest economy is probably not going to step down in time.
To get Washington to back up means to bow to demands, but to publicly crawl for the United States would be far too embarrassing for China's President Xi Jinping.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing is playing its short-term role, the press from the US trade war can give positive support to China in the long term, by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies on each other.
"A rapid political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions for economic panic in either country, and it is actually far more dangerous than the viewers have previously wanted to acknowledge," says Abigail Grace, research assistant focusing on Asia at the New American Security Tank Center.
Syria 'redo' for returning refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that the country is ready to receive voluntary return refugees and appeals for help to build the country, which lies in ruins after the more than seven years of war.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are now being improved.
"The situation in place today is more stable and secure, thanks to our successes in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build up the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures directed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the ruined country.
However, he stressed that it did not receive conditional support or assistance from countries that have supported the rebellion.
Europe resigned with victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with the 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team achieved the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard during most of the tournament, ended up in the water at the break of the 16th hole couple 3-way, and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari gleamed in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever done 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beat out 5 & 4 by the lowest rated players of the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest rated players, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have made his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, who is a veteran with eight Ryder Cup behind, became the most successful europé ever with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win the victory back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be helpful," said a touched Garcia after the European team's victory.
He left his staffing stick to his countryman John Ram, who defeated the American golfing legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in single on Sunday.
"What incredible pride, to beat Tiger Woods. I am grown up looking at him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all its four games in France, and now has the result 13-21-3 for his career in Ryder cup.
A peculiar statistics for one of the world's best players ever, who has won 14 mayort titles, which has only been surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA fought the whole weekend to find fairway, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
The American captain Jim Furyk said after the team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
It was time this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the fight.
Hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the US PGA tour and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be the captain.
You have to bow and bow.
They played better than us."
Alg Flowering: The tails are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in the concentration of algal bloom for parts of the area around Tampa Bay.
According to the Commission, more uneven flowers are reported in the areas around the major municipalities Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which may indicate a decrease in concentrations.
Algbloming extends along over 20 miles of the coast, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee.
Fleas can be seen about a mile and a half out into the sea outside the large municipality of Hillsborough, but in fewer places compared to last week.
Algbloming has also been observed in the large municipality of Pasco.
Average high concentrations in or off the coast of Pinellas have been reported over the past week. Outside the coast of Hillsborough low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations in or off the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations to medium concentrations in or off the coast in Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue to come from the major municipalities Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in the northwest of Florida that past week.
