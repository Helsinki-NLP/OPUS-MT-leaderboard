Biden conducts surveys in three key countries
When there are only 100 days of election, Joe Biden, a protagonist of Democrats, uses a head start in three important changing countries.
CNN reports today that Biden was crossing Florida, Arizona, and Michigan.
In Florida, Biden has 51% compared to 46% followed the president.
In Arizona, the status is 49%–45 % Biden in favor and Michigan in turn leads to Biden’s 12 points, 52%–40 %.
In order to win the elections in November, after 100 days, Trump needs to turn all these countries around, and in fact more.
Trump sits down these days with a crown virus epidemic that countrymen teach him more about and say most of the questions the whole world has failed badly, or very badly at the beginning of the epidemic.
In addition, Trump has been mistreated by protests and riots that sprang up at George Floyd’s death.
For example, Trump and his government have been mistreated or mistreated by those matters.
To crown Trump’s problem, he now sits under severe criticism of having ordered the FBI to break a protest in cities where mayors are Democrats.
It has created a huge wolf among the inhabitants of the cities, and that anger is being passed on to other Americans.
Also, pictures of FBI protesters entering unmarked cars have not helped the cause of the United States.
Watched advertising The Lincoln Project precisely attention to this, but it can be seen below.
Trump defeated all three states in 2016, but with very little vote.
In fact, Trump defeated many governments with a small vote and defeated the election with a minority vote.
Michigan, for example, won with only 10,704 cases.
It's less than 0.5% of the population.
Almost all opinions that political commentators say are significant are showing the same conclusion that Biden is being made.
A new CNN survey in Arizona shows that Biden’s advantage is now seen from the margin of the survey.
The same goes for CNN and the University of Quinpiac about Florida.
In fact, Fox News, which leans well right and declared its support for Trump 2016, has published a survey of the same subject in its media.
The president’s last hope, according to the questions, is that Trump might hope to re-establish the important positions of the swinging nations if the campaign is focused on economics.
After the Covid-19 epidemic, the U.S. economy took a heavy hit, but voters do not seem to link the economic crisis to the crown virus epidemic.
In other words, the vast majority of voters seem to teach Trump that he has failed to respond to the crown virus epidemic, but trust him better to cope with the current economic crisis.
However, Trump has failed to direct the debate at the election campaign.
As a result of the riots that have been burning almost continuously from the news of the video, inconceivable where four policemen killed George Floyd, Trump tried to direct the discussion to the law enforcement and its importance.
Law and Order became his characteristic word.
Now it seems that there has been a complete failure, as before said.
As the polls lean more on Trump, it is more likely that more and more Republicans leave Trump and describe support for either Biden, or someone else, who is then Biden without mentioning him specifically.
This is because in the United States, they vote in many elections on the same currency.
Thus, the voter can simply label with the second category in the Presidential Council section of the vote, leaving it alone as a vote for all the other candidates of the vote.
Thus, the Republicans ’ candidates in other offices are tempted to break free from Trump’s low gang and to obtain independent results in the elections.
Youth’s Olympics in Dakar postponed until 2026
The youth’s Olympics were to take place in Dakar next year, which has now been postponed until 2026 for the crowned virus epidemic after the International Olympics Committee and Senegal reached agreement on this.
However, the delay of the first Olympic Games to take place in Africa is a shock to many young athletes.
A volunteer arrested for the fire in Nantes
A volunteer in the cathedral of Nantes, France, has been arrested in connection with a fire that destroyed the church.
Le Monde observed that the alleged fugitive from Rwanda, who served as a church overseer, admitted to set fire.
A man’s lawyer, in conversation with another media, says that the man is vastly looking for his actions.
Among what was destroyed in the fire was the organ of the 17th century and the historic illustrated windows of the church.
The 39 - year - old volunteer who has not been named was arrested shortly after July 18th, which was then released.
He was then reassigned to a report yesterday, followed by a subsequent arrest.
"No way out of this"
I am welcomed to Baltasar’s home and to Christian Samper, Kopavogi.
My visit is due to a new art exhibition by Baltasar and his daughter, Mireya, which will be opened on August 1st in the Cave of Little Kambi, Sneedfellsne.
Is this the first time that the father shows together?
I'm taken down to Baltasar's workshop, where I have a magnificent painting.
Large, dreary images of the shearers of the past but also of flying creatures; eagles on one, shadows of birds on the other.
From the living room, we're going to the house.
“ We had a horse here with us that bit the grass, ” Baltasar says.
“ The horse works much better than a lawn mower and heights we have. ”
Mireya is with us, Christian and Baltasar, and she tells us how her works deal with the works that are here.
“ Introductions, a combination of paperwork and scarlet.
They're all very white and in contrast to what Dad's doing, where I'm working with the light and stuff like that," she says.
“ It’s been a year since this idea came up.
Then there were certain works that I was working on and would have wanted to show, but they got stuck in Tokyo because of Covid.
When my dad was painting and I saw where he was going, I thought back to my party," says Mireya, but Baltasar's work has a strong cast in Icelandic legends about women's cows and vultures.
“ When I saw that Dad was doing these paintings with the women, ” says Mireya, “I thought it was perfect for me to do jewelry related to them, but she works with Sign’s conqueror, Inga Bjarnasson, a goldsmith.
“ I’ll make an installation from the jewelry. ”
Last year, Mireya attended the exhibition of 72 artists of the Akademian perception at Snæfellsnei, including in the Cave of Little Kambi and found the building fascinating.
“ It’s a new space, a new old barn just made up,” says Mireya, who talked there at Baldvinu Sverrisdóttin, an artist who suggested that Mireya and Baltasar put up a show together.
“ She wanted us both to show, and then we thought:
“ Why not?
This is a good idea."
Baltasar Samper was born in 1938 in Spain and was at the Barcelona University of Fine Arts before he went on a world tour to study art and study.
He visited Iceland in 1961 and became enchanted with land and nation.
So far, he came back shortly after, came to know his wife, Christian, and has lived here since 1963, for 57 years.
Baltasar, an outstanding artist, has held dozens of private shows and shows with Christendom in many parts of the world.
He is the most famous of his large murals, such as the mural at the Flat Island Church and the Frisque at the Vängstäst Church.
“ What affects what I do is the bitterness that Iceland has and no other place,” Baltasar says.
“ These low suns and those shadows that are stretching and stretching.
As soon as I got here, I thought, “Who, here, is workable.”
Mireya is the oldest of Christians and Baltasar’s children, born 1964.
“ There was one thing I knew, it was quite clear that I wasn’t going to become a film artist, ” she asks if she wanted to follow in her parents ’ footsteps.
“ On the other hand, I went to high school on a math and natural science course and did everything I could to get away with it.
Then I realized I was a fugitive.
Then you just have to give up," says Mireya and laugh.
Like her father, she has shown in many parts of the world.
A lot in Japan, to picture.
All the children of Baltasar and Kristihan have walked the art road.
“ I call it a virus, ” says Mireya.
“ There was no way out of this.”
Count Icelandair has been in a grey area when flight crews were dismissed
Minister of Social Affairs believes that Icelandair has been in a grey area when the company terminated all airfare in the middle of a basement.
Then he claims that laws against firefighters to enter an apartment building will be examined after the fire at the Bræderborgstíg.
On July 17th, Icelandair was advised to resign all 38 airfares who worked for them at his partner’s camp while the Air France Association was still at the table of a state fighter.
It was a question of whether Icelandar could intervene and was prepared to resolve the case before Social Court.
To this end, however, flight attendants and Icelandair never came to an end more than 24 hours after the resignations.
However, Minister Dadashon’s Ásmundur says that in his view, Icelandair’s decision was in a grey area and went to the right wage earners.
“ My opinion is that this is a certain right to defend wage earners.
When you're in conversation, when you're inside a consensual, it's not an option to go this way.
It is absolutely clear to me that this was not the case.
I think it is quite clear, in my mind, that men had entered a grey area there what this touched," says Ásmundur.
He will not speak of other companies going the same way as Icelandair.
“ Also, a dangerous discussion now shows that it is only natural to stand up to this system to reduce this right, and that’s why I’m totally opposed. ”
On a bomber this morning, Ásmundur was also asked about the government’s reaction to the fire of a fraternity stop at the end of June, where three died.
The Minister says that the matter is now under investigation, such as the House and the Human Works Agency, to which he has direct recommendations.
“ It’s a law today that the fire department can’t enter the apartment.
I've asked the Housing and Human Resources Agency to look specifically at whether there's a reason to make some legal changes.
I'm ready to make the laws needed to reduce the likelihood that this could happen again," says Ásmundur Einar.
The entire interview with Ásmund can be heard in the player below.
U.S. said increased pressure on Nord Stream 2 - RT Business News
The U.S. government has made further attempts to force European companies to leave behind the North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, led by Russia, according to Welt am Sonntag, which quotes people who are familiar with the subject.
According to the newspaper, U.S. State officials have contacted European engineers to ensure that they are aware of the consequences of continuing the project.
Up to twelve government officials should have held at least two meetings with representatives of businesses during the last days.
Those who witnessed the talks said that the Americans had a “friendly ” note that the United States wanted to prevent Nord Stream 2 from becoming a reality.
“I think this is a very, very serious threat,” said one maid to the German press.
These threats are in line with the recommendations of Mike Pompeo, U.S. Foreign Minister, last week, when he warned that companies participating in the project would best “get out now” or be at risk of penalties according to 232 parts of the notorious Laws Countering America’s Adventures Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
In addition to Gazprom, the Russian energy giant responsible for the development of the project, five European companies are involved.
These are the French company Engie, OMV from Austria, the British-French company Royal Dutch Shell in addition to Wintershall and Uniper from Germany.
In a conversation with Welt am Sonntag, the last company’s representative said that attempts by the United States to undermine “a major infrastructure project” were a clear intervention into the European Union.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Council approved a revision of the national defence law to extend sanctions against companies involved in the establishment of the Russian North Stream 2 gas pipeline.
According to one of the law-enforcement transporters, the scheme can target companies that pay for, or provide, ships, insurance, port status or liaison services for such vessels, as well as those who offer a certificate to Nord Stream 2.
Both European companies and government officials have repeatedly expressed their disapproval of US efforts to share European energy by imposing sanctions against Nord Stream 2, some of which have even called Brussels to cooperate.
Mosque officials have also criticized Washington’s action hard and called it unfair competition.
Earlier this week, President Dmitri Peskov said that Russia would come up with a new plan on how the project will be completed if Washington Councillors keep the new sanctions under stress.
Preparing for further transfer of official agencies to the country
Social Minister for Social Affairs is planning to transfer more public institutions to the country in the near future.
The burning area of the Housing and Human Resources Agency will be moved north of Sakarkrkok in the fall of the decision by the Minister, whereas experts in the department have previously stated that they are not planning to move north.
Ásmundur Einar Dadason, Minister for Social Affairs and Children's Affairs, said in Explosive on The Wave this morning that it was important for the countryside to be transferred to public institutions.
This results in great wealth creation, which also results in diversity.
“ It’s nationally important, we’re trying to build everything around the country.
"Industrial structure, monetary structure, whether in travel services, agriculture, industry, some kind of natural use, and this kind of work as public works, they are very good support for this structure," says Ásmundur.
“ Increasing diversity, creating better support for this resource use and the creation of the nation’s currency. ”
A decision by Ásmundar to move the burning area of the Housing and Human Resources Agency has been strongly criticised by its employees and by the National Association of Fire and Disease Transporters.
Six men who have expertise in burning and working in the department are all inhabited in the capital city area, none of them intending to transfer livestock to Deadar Hook.
“ I think it is quite clear that there are political differences as to how hard it should be done.
My opinion is, and has always been, that we should engage in radical measures to better distribute public services," Ásmundur says.
“ We see that our neighboring nations, Norwegians, and Danir have been doing this successfully. ”
He claims to be convinced that the vast majority of the people want to see a greater distribution of public institutions throughout the country.
“I think we need to take further political decisions on public transport to land, as I was doing with the Housing and Human Resources Agency.”
He takes an example of the transfer of the Food Administration to Selfoss, Iceland’s Land Measure to Akraness, and Skaga Beach unemployment insurance.
“ It is a place of work on Skagastrand today that is of great importance to that community.
I think we should take further steps in this regard."
“ I am preparing further steps in this regard.
Further transfer."
In the fifth dozen arrests in Seattle
The system of racists and the decision of the President of the United States to send federal police forces to cities to discredit had been protested many times yesterday.
In the fifth dozen Protestants were arrested in Seattle.
The Seattle police used blasting bombs and pepper sprays in a massive protest yesterday that the police have described as unruly.
21 policemen were injured and at least 45 Protestants were arrested.
Two months later, Protestants against systematic racism began in the United States after a police officer killed George Floyd.
The protests were used to show solidarity with Protestants in Portland.
There has been a violent conflict between the police and Protestants after the President of the United States sent in the forces of the federal police, who have driven unmarked cars, to the disenfranchised authorities.
Thousands of people met in Portland this weekend and used the law of tearing and rubber bullets when they were struck with alarms between them and Protestants.
A Miraculous child 47 years old
American realist Kenya Moore is doing well by strengthening people in need of technology.
Moore, known for her participation in The Real Housewives of Atlanta, had her first child 47 years of age after ART and called her daughter the miracle child.
“ Pray almost all my life for a baby, ” said Moore to People.
“ So I know the anguish people feel, especially women, to think what I might not possibly have a baby. ”
Moore realized that she was running out on time when she became 40 years old.
“ I didn’t want to have a baby on my own.
I didn't want to be a single mother.
So I waited and after 40 years, I looked up and thought dearly my God," said Moore, who, however, didn't get to know her father-in-law until she was 46 years old.
One year later, they had a daughter.
The real star says his daughter is a miracle child in more than one way.
In addition to what Moore was older than most early parents, her daughter came to the world one and a half months before the appointed day.
Moore went to an emperor’s canal, which proved difficult and took much longer than a traditional emperor’s.
“I call her the miracle labor because it was a child who everyone said was almost no odds for me to have,” Moore said in the interview.

A doctor ran 35 km with a mask
British doctor Tom Lawton ran over the days 35 miles [35 km] with a face mask to show that oxygen saturation did not decrease with facial masks.
Lawton, a doctor at Bradford Royal Hospital, has worked there during the pandemic.
To cancel the oxygen saturation theory and encourage people to wear a face mask, Lawton decided to run to work and back with a mask.
Prior to his departure, he set up a collection of GoFundMe for the Trusell Trust, which provides food supplies in Bradford and in many parts of Britain.
“ I am a great supporter of all things that keep us safe.
That's why I've been in shock with the wrong information that has spread between people that facial masks reduce the oxygen saturation in people," said Lawton.
Lawton said that he had been competing for three years before, but while the pandemic was raging, he would have been reduced.
On Monday, he ran 35 miles.
“I never took off my mask (no food or drink) and my oxygen saturation was 98% spent every time I looked, ” wrote Lawton of Twitter.
Prince Joakim still in hospital
Prince Joakim of Denmark is now at the University Hospital in Toulouse, France, and his condition is stable.
The prince had a brain surgery yesterday after being diagnosed with a blood clot.

Gottlieb warns that the uncontrolled spread of the crown virus in society makes it “very difficult” to open schools in the fall
Washington — Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former U.S. Food and Drug Control Officer, warned on Sunday that opening a new academic year will be a very difficult issue for schools if the crown virus distributes rapidly within these communities.
“ I think that local school authorities need to look at how the distribution is in the community.
If the virus spreads freely in society, it will be very difficult to open in that situation," said Gottlieb in "Face the Nation".
Since the fall is scheduled to begin in the next few weeks, Trump’s government had encouraged the school authorities to open their schools to students and offer lessons at school five days a week.
However, these attempts by President Trump and the minister of education, Betsy DeVos, will come a week after Trump warned that the crown virus epidemic would probably “be worse before it gets better” and confirmed that a school example at the worst of the situation might have to be postponed school opening for a few weeks.
Nevertheless, on Thursday’s day, the Centers for Disease Prevention provided guidance on how to open schools to students most confidently.
Among other things, these instructions call for distance between schools, students, and staff to use facial defences and for students to be divided into defined groups to reduce the number of infections.
However, the Center for Disease Control did not provide guidelines for school leaders on when to close schools in case of an increase in the number of chronic viral infections reported by Gottlieb as being “unfavorable. ”
“ When this uncertainty prevails and specific guidance has not been given as to how schools will be opened, I think that more parents will be careful, ” he says.
“ That is why I think it is very important for me to learn exactly what the standards are, exactly, which the protection centres did not provide in their instructions. ”
Gottlieb said a school district has to think about the percentage of positive social infections, localisation, and testing ability when deciding whether to keep schools open or to switch the alpha into online teaching.
If between 5 and 10 % of the analyses are positive, “the problem arises” but more than 10 % is “the threshold when careful consideration is given to whether to close school sessions.”
“ This is a sign that the passage has gained ground in the community,” said Gottlieb, adding that this would make things Florida’s center, the crown virus epidemic in the United States, difficult to open for next month’s school teaching.
Coronum virus infections have increased to more than 30 countries and Colombian regions, but the center of the epidemic is, as it stands in the sun bottle, at the southern shore of the United States.
However, Gottlieb said that there were signs of slowing the rise in some countries, including Arizona and Texas.
However, although Gottlieb had said that there was “a distinct sign ” that the epidemic began to slow down in some countries in the sun bottle, others, including South Carolina, Alabama, Indiana, and Illinois, are “heating in the coals. ”
Many governors have set rules that oblige people to use masks in public space and have stopped the process of re-opening to detect the spread of the Cronella virus.
Gottlieb said that the state should consider closing borders, limiting the number of people in restaurants, closing cinemas, and other places that offer home entertainment, and setting rules on masking to overcome the epidemic, which is a measure that enable countries to avoid retake the strict limits set at the beginning of the epidemic in March.
In addition to the use of masks by various states, various companies have obliged people to use facials.
The fast-bitter McDonald's is the latest company to make the use of facial defences compulsory and to add it to a group of companies such as Walmart, Starbucks and others who have set their own rules on masking.
Gottlieb said that he assumed that more companies would take up a mask family, especially where the danger is considered to be high.
“ If we can really control the epidemic when the winter moves on until we get vaccines or some kind of treatment that changes the clinical course of this disease, we can do it with masks, that’s relatively simple, something we can all do but that doesn’t change our direct lives and let us keep what’s very important to us, like keeping some companies open and getting the kids back to school,” he says.
Despite the fact that Donald Trump last week did not say that he wanted to use masks throughout the country, he urged Americans last week to use facials and told the White House news conference that “they had an effect. ”
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson: “It’s a good news to expect”
The members of Crystal Palace were hit by the summer by Roy Hodgson, the director of the Society, who declared that the parishor Wilf Zaha wanted to leave the company.
The elephant's broadcast has been playing at Selhurst Park for more than five years and now seems to be going, but it has been said by a team such as Arsenal and Bayern Munich.
Since he is now 27 years old, it will become clear whether a team of the quality class is still willing to pay high sums for him, especially in the financial uncertainties of the sport this summer, after a period where Zaha scored four limits and made five suspensions for the Palace team, which caused some disappointment.
In an interview with Alex Crook at TalkSport after the last game of the season, Hodgson said that “the future was to be expected” regarding the possible departure of Zaha after confirming that the applicant had“ made it clear” that he saw his future elsewhere than his partner.
There are still three years left of the parishioner’s contract with Palace, and last year the company indicated that 100 million sterling would need to make the partner look like him.
So Hodgson completed his seven - to - one period in a row and a draw on the last day of the period, which caused the people to fall to 14.
Zaha found a netmask only once from the middle of December to the end of the season with long shoots to lose against Chelsea.
He was reported to have asked for sale last summer when he tried to get out of the company but no offer was allowed to tempt Palace to sell.
Zaha changed January’s agent, apparently in order to increase the likelihood of getting out of the company, and in the next few weeks he will no doubt have priority in securing social change.
Zaha is the player who played most minutes in the English Selection Department for the Palace during the period and was the only player in the team less than 28 years of age who played 1100 minutes or more, showing how much reconstruction the team might be necessary to engage in with the funds provided for the player.
The hurricane Hannah: Texas’s Coronous Viruses are facing a high risk of a disaster in a “twofold strike”
Weatherers have predicted “a catastrophe ” in southern Texas after hurricane Hanna reached two countries and produced heavy rains and wind concentrations of up to 40 meters [40 m] per second.
When he reached the storm on Saturday, he was classified as a first-stage storm (the lowest score on the five-point scale) and has now been brought down to the tropical storm, but rain could still be found at 150-300 mm on Sunday and the wind could reach 26 meters per second.
In some areas rain has already reached 230 mm, including Cameron County, Mexico’s border.
Hannah was the first hurricane in the Atlantic in 2020, and weather scientist Chris Birchfield advised residents to be on guard: “This is not near the end yet.
During the last few weeks, Texas has had a major increase in the number of coronary virus infections.
The governor Greg Abbott published a disaster report for 23 storm - hit sisters, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston, and Brazoria.
“ All hurricanes are a tremendous challenge.
This challenge is complicated and even harder, as the hurricane passes through an area that has become much worse off because of COVID-19," said Greg.
The hurricane first arrived at 17:00 on Saturday, 24 miles [24 km] north of Port Mansfield, about 300 miles [210 km] south of Corpus Christi.
The second time was not far from here, in eastern Kennedy County.
More than 43,700 people in South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen, and Brownsville, were free of electricity on Saturday night.
Emergency services in Corpus Christi set up gardens close to street corners so that they can be used if a flood will cross the streets.
President Donald Trump of the United States said that the government was watching Hannah and Douglas, who headed for Hawaii, in the Pacific.
Sherry Boehme, who lives at the coast of Corpus Christi, said that the storm that was approaching had increased the anxiety she felt because of the pandemic.
The 67 - year - old woman had mostly stayed home because of health problems associated with chronic lung disease.
She said: “It’s almost like a double hit for us.
I think a lot of people have become nervous.
We'll get through this.
They are all good and strong and stand together."
Posting on a Blussing Sailing in South Africa
Some have had an unusual time in South Africa when the weather has been favourable to farmers.
Most people are finished with the first battle, and another fight is started in many places, and it is expected that at the end of the summer, some will have a third fight.
The weather has played with Swedish farmers like the other inhabitants of the country this summer, and not a spill of the spring on farmers' Tues.
So it's been a success.
The winner of Augustsson, a cowboy in Birtingaholti in Hrunnahväppi, and the engineer in the audience are happy and happy.
“ Yes, it’s just been going very well, I think farmers just have to be broken, it’s been going fine, but they’ve been very good weather for the last half of a month.
Heyin's very good end of the harvest, and the quality of the islands finely over," says Sigurdur.
Victory says that they are growing, especially among the peasants, in flat pits or outhouses, which have been very rewarding, but it is most likely to be in the mood of the roll.
“ It’s really alive, yes, yes, it’s actually been very comfortable this past two months or three weeks, it’s been so dry and good, and then it’s so comfortable to apply this.
It differs everything, there is less stress and can be stored until the morning at times what could be done today, so it is brilliantly comfortable.
But does Victor think any farmers will strike three times?
“ Yes, I could believe that, those first.
We started on June 17th, it may well be that those who were first need to take three things."
The original solution for the wolves--This is how they stop the injuries
The chancellor Adama Traoré, who plays with Wolves in the English division, is a tremendously fast player.
His opposers have moved him to take action so that he does not get past them.
As a result, his shoulder has fallen apart several times, but now the wolves have solved the problem.
The Sun will tell us.
In Wolves' game against Crystal Palace, a medic was able to put something on Traoré's shoulders.
“ This is something we had to do to protect Traoré, ” says one authority within Wolves, but what was being applied to him was child’s oil.
“ Making him smoother makes defencers harder to grab him, and so we can prevent further injuries. ”
Traoré's axes fell first when Wolves played against Tottenham in December.
Since then, the shoulder has dropped from four times, now last against Sheffield United earlier this month.
News of Prince Harry England: A friend of the Duke of Sussex protests claims in a new book that has been between the teeth of people
Stott said in a conversation with Sky News that the contents of the book about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were nothing different from the contents of the gossip blades, the only difference being that the book was confined.
The former soldier wants the sea to be more and more focused on the positive work done by her and her husband, such as their charity.
Stott said: “I don’t feel as if it were anything different from what we read in the gossip magazines, except just now in an internal book. ”
“ There’s a storytelling, but it’s not certain that it came from them. ”
“ I just think it’s one more attack on them, like the gossip magazines that persecute them. ”
“ I realize that they are in the spotlight, and people want to know what they’re doing, but I wish it was more about all the good things they’ve done and their charity, rather than their personal affairs. ”
“ Of course, they never get away with it, for their own sake. ”
The support of the Duke and the Duke of Sussex overcame another member of the royal family, according to a specialist in the history of the royal family.
Dr. Kate Williams told Sky News that the royal family failed to use Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in their behalf.
She added that the royal order was established but that public interest could not be guided.
She also said: “The fact is that all they did in support of the queen was inclined to overshadow other members of the royal family, and this was considered a problem. ”
“They are extremely popular. ”
“ They had fewer weddings than most brothers and sisters in the same position, Andrew had a huge wedding, Anne also had a huge wedding. ”
“ But even though Harry and Meghan’s wedding was smaller than that of William and Katrina, the news of it was as much, because of the great interest of the world community in the couple. ”
Donald Trump admits that he often regrets his voice on Twitter
Donald Trump has admitted that he often regrets his talks on Twitter, which fuel war.
In an interview with Barstool Sports on Friday, the president of the United States told us that his unsuspected re-information on Twitter entries — some of which have contained white racism’s material — would put him in the most trouble.
When journalist Dave Portnoy asked him if he was looking for his records, Trump replied: “Over, too often.
It was like that in the old days, before this came, that you wrote a letter and said that this letter was very big.
You put it on your desk and then you returned the next day and said, “Oh, how glad I am that I didn’t send it, don’t you?
But we don't do it with Twitter.
We sent it out right away, we feel great, and then you start getting calls — “Did you really say that? ”
I say, “What's wrong with this? ”
In the last month, Trump caused great anger after rediscovering a transfer (shared material from another account) with a video of his supporters in the Villages area of Florida, where elderly couples called “What power!” or “Selected White”.
And in 2017, Trump rediscovered three movements directed against Muslims, published by Jayda Fransen, leader of the right - wing group, Britain First.
The president told Portnoy that the revelations that had put him in the most trouble
Trump said: “You see something that looks good and doesn’t investigate it, you understand, and you don’t know exactly what it says on your helmet, which is very small, and you don’t grow it, sometimes — I’ve found that it’s almost always the revelations that get you into trouble. ”
The president often commends himself, rants over his opponents, and conspiracy teachings with 80 million of his followers on Twitter.
Trump says Twitter, helping him to get through the so - called “false news ” in television programs and newspapers, which he says is overshadowed by untruth.
But the President’s lies have often been under the microscope, and Twitter now means Trump’s statements as a misleading one.
The GPS system may be insecure
Many countries are working to develop location technologies other than the GPS system.
Professor of Engineering says that the reason may be to worry about the safety of the GPS system, which is owned by the U.S. Army.
The old Loran system has been resuscitation.
The GPS is with us at every foot.
We use it when we fly, sail, and drive, by land measurement, by industry, and by leisure time.
Most people do not think that it is a military device for U.S. military property, which first opened it up for general use in the 1980 ’ s.
GPS technology uses coordinates from satellites to 20,000 km above earth, thus having little effect on it in nature.
“ But it is very easy to disturb her.
And malicious people can easily interfere with the reception of these markings," says Sämundur E. Torsteinsson, lecturer in Engineering at the Icelandic University, and expert on risk management and the security of communications.
He also says that it is easy to send a false signal with the wrong location, such as in warfare.
“ The GPS system is owned by the U.S. Defence Department.
They have assured the public that the system is ready at all times.
But certainly they can turn this off if it fell into the head of a very curious president to do such a thing, then he might probably do it," says Sæmundur.
Thus, many countries have taken into account other systems and location technologies.
Both Russia and China operate their own satellite system, and the European Union is bringing Galileo to a close.
“ Thegalileo system is primarily built for civil use.
It may be more accurate and naturally controlled by the European Union.
Then there is not one government that can control it completely but many," says Sæmundur.
But many have also begun to look back at the old loran technology.
It was based on radio waves and was used from the '60s until the GPS was under control.
The Loran marks are sent on very long waves from the transmitters down to the ground.
“ It is then a new version of the loran system called eLoran, which stands for Enhanced Loran, that people are seriously considering it in many countries to have it as a system, because it involves some other laws to interfere with it, it is much more difficult than to interfere with a satellite system, ” says Sæmundur.
However, it is probably most secure to have access to most local systems.
An experienced member of the councilman Vern Buchanan died from the crown virus
“Gary was a professional in the fingernail and a loyal servant of the public,” said Buchanan on Facebook.
“ He touched so many people and was loved and admired by those who knew him.
I will never forget how refreshing he was, his sense of humor, and the joy he received from helping others."
Buchanan’s office published a statement earlier this month stating that Tibbetts had not had any recent contacts with others in the office.
Tibbetts, who served outside the office, had worked for Buchanan since 2011.
A flea country has reported 414,511 cases since the start of the pandemic, more than 411,200 in New York City, according to the National Health Authority.
The health authorities ’ data show that hospitalizations have increased by 79% from the U.S. Memorial day, July 4.
The data also show that at least 50 Florida intensive care units reached their limits on Saturday.
“We were told that this could have an effect, ” said DeSantis in June.
“ At the same time, police work and making laws could have an adverse effect. ”
A Fly from the Horn of the City of Cape
The doves, roses, doves, coves, doves, bereaves, bereaves, and weeps are among the birds that have flocked to this country this summer.
On the web of the Birds checkpoints of Southeastland birds.It can be seen almost every day about the flounder, where they have been seen, and sometimes their sex.
There are many of them in Iceland.
To be noted are the number of people who like the Facebook page Icelandic bird species.
The group has approximately 14,600 members.
There are divided pictures of birds, and it is obvious that Iceland is rich with good photographs, who have the patience needed to make birds.
One of them is Brynjolfsson's breasts.
A bear, as it is called, is an employee of the Birds' checkpoints of the south-east and of the Natural Room of the south-east of the land, and follows the birds' life in that area.
He speaks beautifully of these animals that enrich the natural world in Iceland and play an important role, and it does not matter whether the bird is a big, large bird of prey or a small sparrow.
The bird inspection station was founded in 2005 on the birthday of Half-Dr. Björnsson, in the Kværkers in Örøvur, with the aim of continuing the extensive nature studies he was conducting from 1940 onwards.
“ Half a year was 13 when he began writing information about birds, ” says Brynjuver in a conversation with Karnarn.
“ We at the bird inspection station are not doing exactly the same thing as Halfdon did but are building on his data by counting and marking birds. ”
On March 14, 1927, a farmer and a publicist were born.
He wrote a number of scientific articles on plants, insects, and bird life.
He died on February 10, 2017, almost nine years old.
Halfhearteds and his siblings in the Cows aroused interest in many of them in Icelandic nature.
This group includes Björn Gísli Eagleson, “the official ” of the Bird checkpoint.
Bjorn grew up in Reynivöllar in the South, and he received a generously natural apple from his neighbor, Halve of the Cowboys.
What, though, does the Bird’s Thinking Center in Southeastern Europe do?
About March 20, each year, the Birds checkpoint sets up a special birdnet in Einarstunende, a tree grove just below the harbor in Hornafirde.
There are standard markings on the birds that enter the net.
The net will be taken down around May 10 when the laying season begins.
The Internet is up every day, at least from about six o’clock in the morning until noon.
And they have to be checked every hour.
The birds in their coma are marked, measured, and then released back into freedom.
Every hour, a reporter asks the wonder.
“ Yes, we share this with us, me and Bishop.
Since we now have to work for us, it can be a big puzzle, but somehow we manage to do this," says Brynjulf.
The network is then reestablished between August 1st and November 10th — all days of weather permits.
Between guarding the nets and the periods they do not live, Bränjuves and Björn are marking creas, shrubs, and various motherbirds where they reach them.
In addition, they take on various special projects.
One of these projects is working together with the Icelandic National Institute of Natural Sciences and is about gathering birds’ forest mites.
“ In their winter places, the forest ticks and gets to ride with them to land in the spring.
This happens shortly before they leave, so these ticks are not big when they arrive in Iceland.
Then he jumps off the bird and tries to find another host when he needs it."
But there's plenty of ticks.
A question about how the birds in the southeastern part of the world felt this summer, Brynjulf says that the wreath seems to be going well — where it over the head of verpah.
“ This is where Hala, in the South Coast, lay, and everything goes well.
But there was no sign of the JJuljårlon, where a few years ago was a huge layover."
He says that a few years ago, the village was over a thousand krips, but it is now possible to count them on the fingers of another hand.
“ When we look at birds and bullies, I feel that what you find of them has been reduced in the last few years.
But of course there is always a change between years."
What can explain that much change, according to Brynjolf, is most likely about food supply.
“ After all, it’s all about food. ”
In this way, human activity can also tell us about the offspring of birds and other animals.
Some birds, however, seem to have some good things to do in Southeastern Europe that summer.
“ One of the things I like about it is to grow again after a great low, ” says Brynjulf, “but during the time the cloud has been falling dramatically in the last few years and decades. ”
Of sparrows, it seems that the marijuana is going to be doing a good job in summer’s laying, just like last year.
Forest voices and duvets had decreased somewhat, but Brynjulf says it didn't come out until the fall how this summer turned out to them.
But let's turn to the flounder.
Often they attract great attention, especially if they are very simple and even colorful.
These two interesting features relate to one of the most popular delicacies of summer: the rose pole.
“Another has been relatively quiet in the summers, ” says Brynjulf, but mentions that in the countryside there is now a tear, and there are doves and doves that are about to fall here.
When Brynjuves and Bears come to the fort of fleas, they also mark them, just as other birds do.
Marks are international, and they are practiced worldwide.
For example, when birds are wintered, where they lay, and what their journeys are, there are some things that can be accomplished with the meaning.
“ You can even see how long they are on a flight, ” says Brynjuver.
This information is helpful in many ways, to form epidemics such as bird flu.
“ Knowledge is always growing. ”
If someone in the world finds a bird marked by the Antarctic Bird Survey Station, the information will be sent to the Icelandic Natural Science Institute.
“ We have recovered everything from Cape Town in South Africa.
There was a collar we had marked.
One of our crowns was found later in the United States."
One bird is the Brethren's particular thought, and that's the drawer.
“ The beast is our bird, ” he says, pointing out that the Bird Thinking Station and the Natural Institute of Southeast England have their mission to watch his offspring — which has become quite sick and now he is on the watch.
It is difficult to claim what caused collapse in the institution, but one theory is that the shoe has made itself a seabed that was once thrown off by fishing boats and into the sea that good but that it is now being used much better, and this affects the hull.
Are you in the best place in the country to watch birds?
“ You naturally won’t take me to say no, ” says Brynjulf laughing, adding: “Since we are now also chasing birds, we probably have to go elsewhere. ”
Surely, though, the southeast is special when it comes to bird life.
“ This area is like a trip to the land from Europe, and then the birds are scattered from here.
To be here looking at birds and birds of prey is very interesting than to be found in laying birds rather than in many other parts of the country.
It is not far from the sea and to the sea, so the area as such is well suited for observing birds."
But does a Brynjulf have a favorite bird?
He will think about it for a short time before he answers.
Thinks it's hard.
“ I have found nine of the ten that have been seen in the land, ” he answers.
“ I think it’s funniest to take pictures of horses.
So it's always nice to find birds that haven't been seen here in the past or are rare, so I'm not talking about finding new species for Europe."
But they've both been together with Barry and Bishop.
If you want to keep a closer eye on the work of Bendi and Bjassa at the Bird checkpoint of Southeast, you can watch their activities on Facebook and on the web Birds.is
Saudi Arabia — The Sun Coast of the Future? No Alcohol or Bikini
The tourism industry has grown tremendously around the world in recent years, and today the Saudi Arabian authorities want their share of the cake.
Consider the destruction of some 60,000 billion dollars in the land by the authorities.
The Guardian reports.
But this tourist paradise will not be in the style that Iceland and I should get used to in southern Europe.
Alcohol will not be available, and women will not be allowed to sunbathe in bikinis.
How, then, will tourists be lured to this strict Islamic land?
This is to be done, for example, by building a new city that will be white beaches, moons (of course made by humans), car rentals, and robots serving people.
The Guardian says it is Mohammed bin Salman, crown prince Saudi Arabia who wants to invest in this investment.
Of course, the money will be collected in the oil country.
The Crown Prince says that there is no discussion that women can fail to cover their shoulders and knees in public places, but at the same time admits that it is not easy to create a tourist paradise in the country because it is too hot when the sun is high and the wind cannot be trusted.
However, they may wonder, ‘ If they cannot buy alcohol, it will also diminish the interest of future tourists. ’
Francois Bozize, former President of the Central African Republic, announces Presidential Prosecution
The former president of the Central African Republic, Francois Bozize, who had been cast by a chair, announced on Saturday that he would present himself in the presidential elections in December, despite the United Nations' sanctions against humanity and that the arrest warrant was issued for his crimes against humanity.
He announced his presentation in front of a large group of supporters of his class, Kwa na Kwa (“work, only work ”), in the capital city of Bangui.
In 2013, the 73 - year - old former general and general were ousted into the League’s rebellion, largely by Muslim rebels from the north, who plunged the nation of the majority of Christians into a violent civil war and a severe and long - term humanitarian crisis.
“The country needs someone with experience, peace and conviction,” said Bozize in a speech that was critical of the current president’s office, Faustin-Archange Touadra.
Bozize first assumed power after a coup in 2003 and held office for 10 years before he fled the country in 2013.
The new government sought to arrest him for alleged crimes against mankind and for encouraging genocide, but he has not been arrested since his return from exile late last year.
It is not clear how the arrest warrant or foreign sanctions affect its submission.
In January, Bozize said that he would ask the United Nations to lift the punishment measures imposed in 2014 for the alleged support of armed Christian groups of Anti - balaka.
Touadara is operating today with the support of a large United Nations peacekeeping force that counts as more than 13,000 soldiers and police officers.
He was elected in 2016 and is expected to volunteer for a second period, but his offer has not been confirmed.
The first round of voting will be December 27.
In February 2019 the government signed a peace treaty with 14 armed groups who usually claim to defend the interests of certain communities or religions.
Since then, violent crime has declined but bloody events are still the result of most conflicts over resources, but the majority of this diamondic country is not under government control.
Violence has forced more than 1.5 million people to flee their homes.
The Gareth Bale situation in Real Madrid is “unacceptable for everyone” says Toni Kroos
Toni Kroos, center of Real Madrid, says the Spanish state of Gareth Bale is “inconceivable for everyone. ”
Bale did not participate in any of the last seven games of the team and he took a small part in the LaLiga celebration of Los Blancos, and now this summer is the location that the player is planning to stay and let his contract run out, but the company hopes that he will disappear on the track.
“ There’s no way to avoid the situation becoming unacceptable to everyone,” said Kroos on the Launschangriff Endlich was my Sport.
“ He was not bought to play him as little as he is now.
I think he really wanted to leave the company last summer and that the company actually said "yes" but then said "no" later.
I don't know if he's still a little angry about that, but it's hard to say."
When asked if the situation had a negative effect on Real’s atmosphere, Kroos said: “Not as much as we expected.
I've known him for six years, and we've worked things important together."
The Chinese give Reykannesby 2,000 facial masks to support the battle against the crown virus
The Prime Minister, Jin Zhijian, handed over mayor of Reykannestown, two thousand face masks last week.
The occasion was the visit of the mayor to the Chinese embassy on July 22nd.
Weaving news reported first.
The purpose of the mayor’s visit was to repay the Chinese ambassador’s visit to Reykannesby, where he visited the town hall and met with the mayor.
Does the White News say that it has been discussed promoting a partnership between the town of Reykannes and Xianyang, but the communities began their cooperation between 2014.
The 2,000 face masks are rooted in this town’s community, but the Xianyang city authorities wanted to mask and thus support the battle against the crowned virus epidemic.
Says the White News that the masks will be used in the sensitive establishments and in the Reykannestown workplaces for both employees and other visitors there.
In addition to Iceland’s flag and the Althite Republic of China, the accompanying picture shows the inscription on the mask box, which reads: “Every man is behind, except for his brother. ”
Thomsen wants to leave KR - Calculates by reducing wages
Tobias Thomsen is going to try to get home to Denmark, from the Icelandic Masters KR, next month, and he says he's having an interest from partners in the Danish 1st Division.
Thomsen has played in Iceland since 2017 and has become Iceland’s champion with both Val and KR.
However, this 27 - year - old parisher claims to miss Danmerkur and wants to move there with his girlfriend, Stefania Jacobsdóttir.
Danan’s contract with the KR stands until the end of this season, so it is clear that a Danish partner had to negotiate with KR for a price to get it in August, before the new season begins in Denmark.
Otherwise Thomsen would have to wait until winter to get to Denmark.
“ Yes, I know that the Danish divisions start again at the end of August.
That means, of course, that I have to negotiate my contract with KR-inga but I've told them that I miss Danish, and they have full understanding of it," said Thomsen to the ball.dk.
He added that he had a very good relationship with a coach, Rúnar Kristinsson, who had fully understood the situation, and Thomsen said that he did not think the purchase price would be a big problem.
“ I’ve also had a conversation with two 1st Branches after that division was finished, and I’ve known where they would end.
There has been a little interest already in the coming period, so it may well be that I go to Denmark before the Icelandic branch quits," said Thomsen, but added that it was clear that there are not many companies in Denmark who could buy up his contract with KR.
“ It’s not quite clear now, but it’s been interesting.
I also need to find the best chance for me and my girlfriend, who comes with me from Iceland.
This depends on a few things," said Thomsen, saying that he was looking first and foremost at the Copenhagen Sea.
Thomsen said KR-inga didn't have to worry that he didn't give himself all the training and games, though he missed Danish.
“ KR knows what it gets from me, and that’s when I do things 100 percent.
I can completely overlook the fact that I miss Danmerk when I'm in practice or in games," said Thomsen, who says clearly that he's going to lower in pay when we leave the Icelandic Masters in the next section of Denmark.
“ I’m probably going to have to cut down a little bit, out of the crowned virus crisis that seems to have caused the Danish communities to lose a little more than the Icelandic ones.
But I'm also studying, and one solution might be that a company provided me with a job.
Most of the companies in Section 1 have an agreement with a sponsor.
I'm learning sports management through the Players' Association, and I'm finishing the bachelor degree," said Thomsen.
Thomsen has only been at the beginning of KR's in two games in the Pepsi Max section of this season, but we have a story in five games and scored one goal.
He started 21 games last year and scored seven marks.
KR is equal to the score at the top of Pepsi Max Division and is playing well, but the team meets the KA at Akureyri today.
Dealing with the crown virus on board a bus as a driver lands in a hot argument about face masks
The video shows passengers and driver on board the Arriva Road Car in Liverpool handling masking.
The driver is heard explaining to a woman that it is not his job to tell passengers to wear a mask.
The driver said: “It’s not my job to tell anyone who gets into the wagon using a mask. ”
Regarding the incident, Witness said: “A man and an older woman began to respond to her, and much arguments broke out. ”
“ The driver had to leave his seat and came to ask what was really going on, and he told one woman that she wasn’t even using the mask correctly. ”
“ Then a woman ran away from the chariot and said she was going to report the incident. ”
Arriva, a spokesperson, said: “The safety of customers and our employees is at our top.
“Our customers are already obliged to use masks when using public transportation (exceptions apply).”
“Acquiring customer guidance and markings and all other rules of distance are on board in bus, on community media, and on our website.”
There has been a practice in public transportation since June 15.
More than 16.3 cases of COVID-19 have been identified worldwide.
More than 650,000 have died.
More than 9,900,000 people have recovered from the world’s crown virus.
Most COVID-19 cases have been reported in the United States, or more than 4.3 million.
Octavia Spencer calls for Hollywood to advise people with disability more often in their role
The actress participates in a new campaign to increase the number of people with disabilities in the entertainment sector.
The campaign is going on at the same time as 30 years have passed since the United States Act on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which says on Sunday.
In the video, Spencer talks about the importance of people seeing themselves and their lives actually reflected on the screen.
“ Nothing can replace personal experience and genuine publications, ” she says.
“ This is why it is so important to hire an appropriate actor for an appropriate role. ”
Spencer spoke about the effect she was having on screen when she was a little girl watching the good Times.
The conclusions of CBS from 1974 to 1979 were made by Norman Lear, and they ran the road as the first jokes to show two parents of both African backgrounds.
Hungry organization pushes Yoho aside after an incident in the Parliament House
WASHINGTON (AP) — Regardless of the Christian organization who wants to end hunger, Saturday Saturday said that they were waiting for Senator Ted Yoho to resign from the Congressman’s leadership, and that he would have done so, after what they called “attack” at Senator Alexandriu Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio-Cortez, Democrata, New York, accused Yoho, Republican Repuy in Florida, of using low-level and male-stricken speech when he reprimanded it when they met the steps of the Parliament last Monday.
Yoho claimed that he had not used the words that were quoted, but a reporter who witnessed the incident confirmed that the phrase had been as it was.
Bread for the World stated in his statement that the harmony regime had met Yoho on Friday and sought to make a promise that he would “right our commitment to stand with women and skin - blind people, inland and on a global scale, leading us to the world with increased participation of all races and increased justice. ”
The Bread for the World Web site says that their “co - Christian voice ” pressured Congress and government to end famine in the land and on a global scale.
“ Since Bread for the World is independent of a Christian organization whose goal is to reduce hunger and poverty with sound public policies, the organization holds up the dignity, dignity, and concern that Jesus asks us to show when dealing with people in power, wherever it is on the political spectrum, ” says the statement.
“ In our view, the recent acts and words of the councilman Ted Yoho, reported in the media, do not reflect the moral demands made to our rulers. ”
In the process of the story, Yoho’s spokesman had not answered e - mail with the invitation to respond.
In an amazing speech in the House last Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez dramaticly spoke from the incident and spoke against what she called a male mammary culture that “accepts violence and violent speech against women. ”
More than a dozen of her colleagues agreed with her statement that the incident was an example of far too common behavior in men.
Yoho described the incident as a short discussion of policy and “nobody had been disturbed, monopolized or attacked. ”
He said that he regrets having shown “a pitiful attitude. ”
The 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez is during her first term as a progressive senator and has received both praise and vice for her cleanliness.
The 65 - year - old Yoho, one of the most conservative councillors of the council, will sit down in holy stone after his fourth term of office.
Wait until 9th minute in the locality score the first target of the season
Jesse Lingard had not scored or posted in the English finals of this season, until he scored against Leicester today on the 98th minute in the final tour of the department.
Lingard had not scored in the English prime since he scored twice against Cardiff in December 2018.
He came in today as a reserver for Manchester United when Leicester had a final game on the Master's seat.
When more than seven minutes had arrived, Lingard held the ball by Kasper Schmeichel Leicester’s goalman and scored the blank target.
Jesse Lingard's far-reaching goal.
Players Real Madrid Excepted Precautions
Zinedine Zidane and his disciples in Real Madrid will be able to arrive in England for the second time at Manchester City, Europe’s Master’s Department, without having to go to a two - week hospital.
The British government has decided that tourists from Spain have to go to a hospital for two weeks, to disrupt the spread of the crown virus.
However, there are exceptions, such as in the case of a competition team at the highest level of sports.
This confirmed the Ministry of Sports at Sky Sports.
The Ministry says that individuals who are exempt from the rules will only be in isolated areas at closed doors.
This applies to sports stars, judges, coach, medical teams, and media.
So Madrid can meet Manchester City on August 7, without having to stay for a long time in England, which is 2–1 in the duet after losing Santiago Bernabea on February 26.
The winning team will move on to an 8 - year - old final in Portugal.
A rain of rain and rain on the land during a commercial weekend
From reports of overcrowded hotels and tent areas, in the smallest south, it is clear that Iceland has been able to travel inland this summer.
Have those who have set their ground at the same time been in complete luck with the weather and weather department DV in agreement that summer has only been purely beautiful, so far to the very least.
But now it's late for a commercial weekend that's so far been the greatest holiday of the year.
However, it is unclear how it will be this year, compared with the rest of the weekends, as it is now the case that events that in the ordinary year have attracted a great many people not to be held.
For example, it is enough to mention a national festival.
Of course, the weather will play a major role, but now it looks like rain of rain all over the country, but especially south and southwest.
The weather room predicts a rainstorm from Thursday evening and at the very least until Saturday night.
It should be noted that long - term predictions are not the sacred truth here in the North Atlantic Ocean and may no doubt change.
In his prediction of the weather web, Bluka, the weather scholar named Einar Sveinbjørnsson said that the commercial weekend is expected to be low.
Says he: A latrine in the attic with a cold belonging that too often reaches the surface, leading to the nearness of warm air from the southwest, just a wind - and - precipitation.
Of course, even more warm air that “exploits ” here in the north.
In support of his prediction, Einar says: “A small wave from America runs east and with it a summer sky.
As it approaches, it reaches the “flowers” in the form of falling air pressure and a meaningful summer fall."
The big prediction, the European Calculus left on the map, and the US GFS predictions to the right are quite attuned to this trend.
The message of the low will go over the late Thursday and early Friday with a windy A-Speed and rain in most of the country.
The centre about 985 hPa will then follow.
This time, there will be some warm air in the North and East on Saturday and even Sunday.
On the other hand, it could be mixed.
A man seriously injured a car with cattle selected in Wexford
One was seriously injured in a traffic accident earlier today at the Ferrycarrig Bridge in Wexford.
A cattle truck marched on the bridge and operated on a manless, stationary car.
The 34 - year - old driver suffered severe injuries in the accident, which occurred at 1:50 p.m. today.
He was taken to the hospital in Wexford, where he was in heavy distress.
Police Department of Technology is investigating the scene and the bridge has been closed, and there has been some complications.
A lot of cattle were killed in the crash.
The police encourage all traveling around the road from 13:45 to 14:00, as well as others in the area who may have witnessed the incident, to contact the Wexford police station on the 053 916 5200, the police confidential telephone in 1800 666 111, or other police stations.
Following an actress from Law and Order all the way to New York
“I was shot in her like you get such a childhood shot,” says Birna Rörn Björnsdóttir about Mariska Hargitay, the leading actress of the Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
She was so stunned by the actress that she showed up at the scene and waited for her hours, just to say hi.
When Birna Rörn Björnsdóttir, owner of the travel office Pink Iceland, watched like many Icelanders at the tensions Law and Order: Special Victims Unit up from the centuries ago, she ran for the leading actress of the Marian Hargitay.
Birna tells us the story of her and her actress in the episode Love Story of Raás 1.
When Birna was a teenager herself, at the age that many begin to develop with a violent love, she did not feel like her peers because she was in a hurry to suppress her own teachings.
She pretended to be interested in boys’ bands and young sexiers from movies, but she certainly didn’t.
“ I was cutting off poppers and hanging pictures on a wall of Backstreet boys and Jared Leto.
But there was nothing behind it, it was just me hiding that I was a lesbian."
She says that sometimes it is said that when people come out of the closet, they go through a late age.
“ We spend our teen years suppressing these teenage impulses, those shots, and so on.
I think it was one of the things that drew me to her," says Birna about the actress.
“ And there was something about her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm, and I just got shot at her."
When the actress was in New York a few years ago, she ran out of bed.
One of her best friends, Erlingar Otttar Thorodsen, was to shoot a movie there in the city and got Berna and their friend Gunnar Helga Gujonsson to help with the shooting.
“ We were working in a crew of 30 people and spent a lot of time with strangers.
It's a natural inner atmosphere when you spend so long a day talking about everything and nothing."
One day Birna is a great fan of Mariska.
One woman in the camera team says that his friend knows the actress because he was on the stage.
Birna could not stop thinking about that fact and ask her new friend regularly how her friend would like to work with her actress and if Birna could see her.
“She tells me to stop, she doesn’t know if she can make it happen, ” says Birna.
When the film is finally under control, the group will be behind us, and Birna will last try to convince the woman that she is trying to get the meeting around.
“ She had a few glasses and said she would only make it. ”
A few days later, Birna sends the woman a message and asks if there is anything going on.
The woman does not respond and Birna decides to give up.
One morning she wakes up in a long - awaited message.
“ I look at the phone and yell at me.
Gunnar Helgi wakes up at the scream and I say, "I have to take a shower and I have to do myself fine and go down to town."
The woman had then written to Birna that her friend, actors, and the Law and Order team were being supported in a hotel in Times Square.
“ I don’t know when they’ll start or when they’ll leave, but this is the name of the hotel, good luck,” says the message, and Birna’s dress quickly, asking where the taker will go and take the lift to the 45th floor where the group is gathered.
Birna sits down and waits for a woman in her staff to come to her door and ask this uninvited woman to help.
“ I say I’m looking for Jason and asked the woman to tell him that Birna from Iceland had arrived. ”
When his friend finally arrives, he looks at Birna and asks how in the trouble she got all the way to the end was supposed to be a strict security guard.
Birna explains that she just took the elevator and asked to meet Mariska.
“ Yes, I don’t know.
Sit here," says my friend Birna.
Next to her, there's an extra player in the show, and they're starting to talk.
“ I say to him, ‘ I am a fan, but you are? ’ ”
“ I played it as if it were the most normal thing in the world. ”
Time's up, Birna's waiting.
The players come out regularly when a break is made, they get a talk and Birna looks around and looks for Mariska which is nowhere visible.
Finally, my friend comes along and tells her that he is leaving.
Birna asks him to get into the hands of another employee, but she did not think she would leave immediately.
Surprisingly, your friend approves it and reaches another employee.
“ He comes with one of his friends and says, ‘ This is the woman from Iceland who really wants to meet Mariska. ’ ”
Then he goes.
Finally, after two hours, our new friend will be running to Birna.
“ He says: ‘ Hurry.
These are unusual conditions today, there are reporters with her so she won't stop.
She's going straight to the car with them, so you have to take the chance and go down and find her trailer.
It's white and it's marked.
Hurry up."
“ So I look to the right and lose my face ” Birna vehemently takes the elevator down to Times Square.
There she finds some 40 trailer, some marked, and some unmarked.
Mariska’s house, however, does not find it, and it is desperate to act.
“ I can feel the bug, because I had spent half a day on it, but I thought so, I tried.
It was fun."
Vondauf keeps Birna back to the hotel, where she sees through the window the camera crew looks at her with the eyes of the sun, realizing that Berna did not succeed.
Birna accepts the destiny, and it starts to rain.
“ I go under a shelter to cover myself up for the rain.
Then I look right and lose my face."
No one other than Marian Hargitay stood there in her pants suit, which Birna knew well — but Birna could hardly move out of emotion.
“ I look at my body and hands and think now you have to move.
Now you must go towards her."
Birna does, and she dares to cock her shoulder on the actress.
“ She looks at me, and I can hardly say anything.
But I'll just say hello," she'll tear up Birna.
“ I say I am from Iceland and a great admirer.
She says, "It's so nice to meet you."
The conversation didn't go much further because the Mariska car is here and it's whistled at her.
“ I have to go, ” says Maria, “but it was really nice to meet you. ”
Birna says the idol of fidelity, watching the car drive away and then break down.
“ I called Erling and Gunna on an excellent basis, and they thought this had not worked out.
But I was crying for excitement and joy.
I say, "Yes, I'll meet her, and you'll have to see me now.
Then we toasted in soda water and tequila," says Birna.
She regrets nothing, although she admitted that she would probably not repeat the game.
“ It’s like this once in your life, to sacrifice such time and energy to act like that.
But I'll always be a fan of this woman."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke with Berna Rörn Björnsdóttir in the episode Love Story of Raás 1.
The police don't spread the virus.
There is no point in worrying about the fact that the Cronum virus can be transmitted by policemen using alcoholic beverages.
This is said by a police officer in the police traffic department in the capital city area during a conversation with mbllis.
People who are concerned that the same mouthpiece is used for all drivers when the police intervene, get caught on a road street, and let anyone on the way blow.
The police, however, say that cleanness is the most important thing.
“ It’s not really a special mouthpiece, but we have a cup that people blow into, ” says one police officer.
“ Some people would like to be warned about this, but we can help people to keep a little distance, up to a few dozen centimeters. ”
Asked if it seems far enough, says a policeman so be.
If it proves to be positive, the police will use it to another extent.
It has a mouthpiece, which comes from sealed plastic bags and is only used once.
Abdominal distension: Among other things, it is possible to collect anise to reduce pain.
The relationship with depression is not a coincidence.
Individuals suffering from enterocolitis, a disease characterised by abdominal pain, convulsions, bloating, flatulence, constipation and diarrhoea, often experience anxiety and depression, which may lead to worsening of symptoms according to the US anxiety and depression organisations (ADAA).
“ This is because the colon is partially controlled by the nervous system that responds to stress, ” ADAA explains.
In the absence of a reduction in bloating, there may be food intolerance.
Judge tries to stop the decision to release children from immigration
In his decision on Saturday, the judge invalidated Dolly Gee’s expected time limit by saying that the U.S. immigration and customs authorities do not have to release children if they cannot do so by any of the three routes described in their previous decree.
However, Gee also stressed in his decree that the authorities of the importing countries and customs authorities should remain under obligation to let their children go without undue delay.
The three routes that Gee proposed are to release families held by immigration and customs authorities, to put children in the hands of a responsible person or to release families from a federal court order.
Shalyn Fluharty, director of the agency Proyecto Dilley, who provides legal services for families, condemned the decision and told her to put it in the hands of the immigrants and customs authorities to decide whether to continue having children.
“The point is, I think, that children are being held captive untimely, and they don’t get out unless the authorities agree to it or families agree to split up,” said Fluharty.
Families are being held at three locations of immigrants and customs authorities in Berks, Pennsylvania, South Texas (Dilley) and the Karnes County in Texas.
The children in these positions are aged 1 to 17 years according to lawyers and legal advisers.
In June, Gee, who supervises the operation of the Flores agreement on child care in custody, said that since “the rules on masking and social exclusion were not or were not complied with” it would be important to transfer children from these workplaces.
969 persons in custody of the importing and toll authorities have been diagnosed with the crown virus and are in isolation or surveillance as of 23 July, according to the importing and toll authorities.
Of these, 25 cases are confirmed in Karnes, one in Dilley, and two in family custody centres.
A total of more than 3700 cases have been confirmed in custody
Will examine the law on government independence
The prime minister does not say that pension funds set a standard in their investment policy on the rights of working people.
The comments made by the Bank Governor to ensure the independence of the directors of pension funds, possibly by law, will be considered.
After Icelandair took part in discussions with Iceland’s Flying Secretary and resigned from all flight crews, VR’s government declared that directors appointed by VR to the Icelandair Pensions Fund or voted against the participation of the Pensions Fund in the future partial offer.
Ragnar Thor Ingofsson, president of VR, further said that directors would be replaced if they did not go to the recommendation.
Ragnar Thor withdrew his statement three days later as well as VR’s control.
Ásgeir Jónsson, the bank manager, said in the reports ROUV on Friday that the independence of the directors of pension funds in the agreed funds and possibly by legislative change needs to be ensured.
The prime minister, Katrin Jacob’s daughter, says it is important that executives of pension funds are independent, but they already believe that they are guaranteed by law.
“Now, ” she says, “a banker, who of course is involved in the financial control that has to do with this, has said that we need to look specifically at the regulatory framework around this independence, and we will, of course, consider it if something needs to go over there.
Katrin says that according to pension funds, the law lays down moral criteria in its investment policy.
It is desirable to consider the social and moral standards that they want to highlight in their investments.
“ I felt that it was not unusual that pension funds also set their investment policies on the rights of working people.
But I naturally believe that such decisions are made through policy making but not through individual investment decisions," says Katrin.
“Intatiable traffic jams at the River Bridge,” says the President of the City of Årborg.
Helgi S. Haraldsson, President of the City of Árborg, says that traffic jams formed by the Alfsårbru of Selfossi daily are completely unacceptable.
He hopes that new bridges across the river will be launched in the fall.
Now that Iceland is traveling through its country, and there is a lot of traffic on its highways, a daily traffic jam is created at the river bridge when drivers are on their way to Selfoss or through the local community.
Long rows form at the bridge and can take the patience of drivers to wait in a row.
“ Yes, it’s totally unacceptable, it’s a traffic jam here and not just on Fridays, because it’s just been in active days, too.
There are long waitings, sometimes quite on Hellisheiði for those who want to get by here on their way east to land and those who are coming west, so it gives notice that we need to get a new bridge and no later than yesterday," says Helgi S. Haraldsson, President of the City of Årborg.
Helgi says that the city authorities in Årborg recently had a meeting with the director of the Vegan Project and the designer of the Vegan Project, and that meeting was very positive.
“ If you have ever been optimistic that you are working on these matters, I think I can say it now, because it is really working on this and we should be able to see that a new bridge will be offered in the fall. ”
But is there any advice to drivers who are in the queue at Alfårbúr every day over the summer hours?
“ Yes, it’s possible to go through the narrows and through the ear tray, that’s fast, but those who are going to the east, they can’t be pointed out to go the Lyngdal Heh, but those who are going to the riot should use Mosfellshei, Dingvell, and Lyngdal Hehíi. ”
Helgi S. Haraldsson, President of the City of Årborg, who says the traffic jam, formed by a bulldozer at Selfoss intolerant.
Each day, long waitings take place at the river bridge and often need drivers to wait for a considerable amount of time to cross the bridge.
Then the only advice is to take a deep breath and think positive things.
The future of the koalabs in northern Brisbane
The city government said that, in addition to the vital role of the area, the coalabes, the squids, and the grey crayfish, it would be an important link between the natural areas of Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek.
The Commission has called for the rejection of the City Government to be addressed to the Court of Justice of the Organization and the Environment, arguing that the building is in line with civil society law as of 2014, would meet organisational and social needs that have not been met so far and “can be carried out without adverse effects”.
These planned projects have a strong resistance to opposition in the surrounding area.
The executives argue that despite full harmony with the organization, it could be changed if it fails to meet its requirements rather than reject it.
At present, the project involves a number of stages, including a service station, child - care centre, and 39 residences.
Official submissions were more than 120 during a consultation period, and most of them protested the suggestion, since it was too large and inappropriate for the area.
The minority leader of Brisbane’s city government said that the city needed to buy the land to protect the koala.
“The mayor] Adrian Schranner must stop wasting the funds of taxpayers in a fight with the executives for judgment and buy this country to protect Brisbane’s natural and animal life,” said city councilor Cassidy.
“ These are one of the most important places in the mountain to Mangroves area of the coalabes, where there are many coalabeans. ”
Schranner said this week that the city government wanted the koalabs in the area to be protected.
“ We didn’t find the tile suitable for the area,” said Schranner.
“ I understand that this is now going through the judicial system, and obviously we hope that it will result in a good and positive outcome that will lead to a return to our home.”
Schranner said that the map of the home koalabs is the joint responsibility of the city and government, but that the government is responsible for the precise maps of the home of the koalabs supported by local authorities when they accept applications for implementation for treatment.
Sunshine: The next step is to win something
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Coach Man Utd, was hoping for a battle that the team had secured its third place in the English finale section today.
So it will play in the European Masters' Department of Europe during the next period.
The United had a draw or a victory against Leicester today, and the result was the 2-0 victory of the Red Devils.
“ It’s a great achievement for the players to achieve a third place according to the situation during the season.
I think we boys might have gotten over a spiritual laugh by winning such a big game, as we've lost twice in the last few moments during this period.
We knew that we needed an outcome today, now we can start the next chapter that is with these boys to win the title," said Solskjær victory.
Manchester United still has the potential to win title during this period, but the European division in August is almost there, and is almost there in the 8th - century final.
Armament break starts at midnight in East Ukraine’s war - torn East Ukraine
Kíev, Ukraine — Ukrainian army and resistance in eastern Ukraine are now preparing a “complete ” truce to begin at midnight and as representatives hope to be the first step towards peace after six years of conflict.
On Sunday afternoon, representatives of the opposition said that they had given orders to their soldiers for a truce and issued an order to ban the use of weapons.
Ukraine’s military forces said that they had “preparation ” for the ceasefire.
If that were to happen, it would “make the way for the implementation of other provisions” of the Minsk Peace Convention, as stated earlier by President Ukraine in the week in which the truce was called a time-out step.
The objectives of the Minsk Peace Agreement, undertaken in 2015 by France and Germany, were to release from the conflict between Ukraine and the separatists who enjoy Russia's power, which began in 2014 following the integration of Russia in the Crimean region and the country's support for its separatists.
More than 14,000 people have died in the fighting.
On Sunday, the presidents of Russia and Ukraine welcomed both of them in a telephone call and stressed the importance of reaching the agreement reached at the Paris meeting in December.
Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, expressed concern at Mr Kiev’s call for the Minks Convention to be reviewed and said that Volodimir’s position as President of Ukraine “the independence of the Minsk Convention, which he was still expressing in this telephone call, should be reflected in real action”.
However, it stressed the need to take “more effective action” to free those Ukrainians who are prisoners of rebels in East Ukraine, the Islamic Crimean, and Russia, as stated by the President’s office.
According to the 2015 agreement, Ukraine can only have jurisdiction over borders with Russia in the areas under its jurisdiction once it has been granted wide-ranging autonomy and has been elected in the regions.
The convention reduced conflicts, but Ukraine and the rebels have continued to take turns.
When the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris in December to have other discussions, support for the Minsk Convention and agreed to resume the peace process.
The year 2019 was won by a Finnish government who promised to end the conflict. Ukraine wanted to have jurisdiction over its borders for the first regional elections, but the Kremlin government demanded that the agreement be implemented without any change.
The new Armaments Agreement was reached on Wednesday by a three-sided working group, appointed representatives of Russia and Ukraine, as well as the European Security and Cooperation Agency, and was therefore welcomed by EU officials.
At the traditional Sunday flash in St. Peter’s Square, Pope Francis also referred to the truce and said that “the need to rebuild trust and lay the foundation for very necessary and long - awaited peace with the people ”.
Police: A man shot to death in a protest in Texas
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A man was shot to death in a Texas protest when he approached a car and the driver in the car fired off his weapon, according to the police.
Katrina Ratliff, police spokesperson, said early Sunday morning that the shooting took place just before 22:00 in protest in Austin.
The man was taken to a hospital, where he was later decided to die.

According to Capochiano, the man carrying a rifle approached the vehicle and was shot by the driver.
The driver then drove away, said Capochiano.
Ratliff said that first reports suggested that “the victim may have had a rifle ” and added that the suspect was in custody and was willing to cooperate with the police.
According to news agencies, the group had gathered for the Black Lives Matter protests on Saturday.
The protesters were streaming live on Facebook, where the whistle of the car and a few shots were heard.
Marta soup in July 1st Battle of Bili
In the Pepsi Max division of men at Kopavangställ this evening, IA won its first victory in June 29.
In contrast to their third row in the league, there is a loss of the Skagarmen.
After winning his first three games in the league, Abbreviated five games without celebrating victory and had lost three consecutive games for the game at IA tonight.
It was, therefore, enough or dying for Blik, who came with great force into the game.
Alexander Helgi Sigurdarsson led the team with a reasonable payment in the 11th minute after Christian Steindorsson had sent him through the defense of IA.
Six minutes later, the Christian doubled his leadership after a fine preparation by Gísla Eyjolfsson from his left edge.
There was no land or beach in the first half of the year, where the local high - pressure team made it very difficult for them to link shipments.
The bellows had all the power on the field and raised the third mark in 36 minutes when Daninn Thomas Mikkelsen shot in the corner of Hobby the son of Gunnlaug.
Then Christ the son of Steindor scored his mark another, and the fourth, three minutes later.
However, the story of the first half of a story did not end there.
The Krauts were given hope for the second when Tryggvi Haraldsson cut off Vite Pledge just before a play break, but Kwame Quee had then broken down Viktor Jon's son within Teigs Bili.
So 4–1 was the status of A.D. when the half - a.m. was faulty.
Only three minutes had passed by the second half of the year when the Skaga men scored again.
Henður Saevar Jónsson was then alone and unelected in a targeted Blika and was able to control the ball easily in the net after the horned bridge of Hrafn Haraldsson.
When Alexander Helga was broken, however, there was a misunderstanding within the Teigs IA just three minutes later.
The Swedes were condemned, and Thomas Mikkelsen was confident that he would come over at 5–2 hours after just seven minutes had passed by the second half of his life.
Five minutes after Mikkelsen's target, the Skags returned.
Anton Ari Einarsson, a goalkeeper of Blika, then came under pressure from Viktor Jon's son, gave the ball to Viktor's foot from which the ball rejected the net.
An incredible 5–3 position occurred when less than ten minutes were passed by the second half of the year, which slowed down the target score.
Despite a great opportunity for both teams to add to the threshold, including two Kwame Quee death mechanisms from the City, they were no more and 5–3 complete.
A moment thus won his first victory in less than a month, from June 29, and is followed by 14 points in third place, two degrees from Val, above, and three degrees from KR.
However, KR and Valur have both games inside of Blik.
The IA has to accept the third loss in a row, but it has ten points in the eighth place, five points from the base.
Despite the White House’s Spears
Yesterday’s producers of the Volpa group claimed that they were not in a position to stop showing children’s material in the near future.
The statement follows Kayleigh McEnany, White House media representative, that the elements that include law enforcement dogs were victims of “cancel culture. ”
The Canadian producers were quick to respond to McEnny’s words and stated that their fans would not have to worry about the future of the Armed Forces.
In the United States, a number of television viewers dealing with police activity have recently been taken out of a show following a protest campaign against police violence.
Even so, despite its reputation on social media, the mob is not one of them.
At a news conference in the White House on Friday, McEnany said that President Trump of the United States was opposed to “exclusion culture” and especially when the police arrived.
The term refers to when references or actions of individuals or companies give rise to a severe reaction to social media, and they are called after to protest.
“ We saw a few weeks ago that the show at the Rhino, children’s material about cops, was stopped.
The same is true with Cops and Live PD," said McEnny on Friday.
In addition, she added that the Danish toy manufacturer Lego took out a law - enforcement agency, but there is no record of that claim, according to Lego’s defenders.
However, it is true that the real features of Cops and Live PD have recently been removed from the Western Ocean exhibition.
Among other things, both participants are controversial about showing pictures of real police work without being allowed to appear with individuals there.
Together for 29 years - Sometimes comes jealousy and suspicion
Kristiin Tomasdódti, a family therapist, answers questions about family, children, and love at DV’s family corner.
This time, she answers to readers who have never been single.
Since our 15 - year - old age, we have been together for 29 years and have two children.
We can only stay together and feel good, but both of us have felt as if we were missing out on something.
We have never been with other people, and we have no comparison of how this might be different.
This has at times led to jealousy and distrust about whether the other party is looking around, thinking of adultery, or even divorce, and changing.
When we discuss this, we agree to cultivate our relationship, but it is such a bruise that always hangs over us.
Do you have any advice?
Thank you for a wonderful question, and I am delighted that you have such open communication that you can discuss your complex feelings in connection with the relationship.
What would scare me would be if you were thinking about it in either corner, you couldn't talk about it and even take some steps you could later regret.
Everything on tables, isn't it always best?
Strong identity has the most predictive value of happiness in the future and the stronger identity you have, the more likely you are to acquire a mate with a strong identity.
Because relationships that start in their teens do not always last a lifetime, people often develop in different directions, but in those situations where the effects of the relationship can be combined, individuals can become stronger overall than many others.
Since your relationship begins in your most formative years, you can conclude that you have grown together and have a positive effect on each other’s identity.
The relationships we are in today’s world mold us.
The way I speak, is shaped by the way you listen.
The way I show myself depends on how you see me.
Associations mold who we are.
Could you turn the example around and think, ‘ What do we have that others do not have? ’
What does this long - term view give us?
I allow myself to claim that there may be a lot more benefits than the bile.
You’ve been shaping each other for years, and as a result, you can say that you’re custom - shaped.
That's more than a lot of people can say.
That worth it?
You are talking about the loss of something, but it is important to remind yourself that major changes, such as divorce and new relationships, also follow accompanying fish that you are not necessarily interested in.
You may be missing out on starting over, learning to be alone again, getting to know a new person, and putting together families.
This follows new challenges, different challenges, and possibly new and exciting things.
But this does not only result in pink clouds and happiness, but, at your age, it can become a messy project, which may never be as good as you've already done to each other.
Is it worth it?
Nor would it be advisable to put the focus on what you can do to increase your tension, unforeseeableness, and innovation in your relationship?
You haven't put your shoes on the shelf yet.
There are so many things you can do to make this long relationship even deeper.
What efforts can you make in this regard?
What do you need from your mate you are not getting?
What can you give your mate that you have never done before?
You may need to sit down and redefined your relationship.
Would you like to spend more time alone or together?
Would you like to try something new?
Today, much more tolerance to various forms of relationships is being defined, and couples have begun to define their relationships in various ways, such as an open relationship, a number of people, or decide to temporarily stop.
I'm not telling you what to do, at all, no expert in your solutions, but possibly it would relieve that heavy fat that is coming upon you, if you face this and think about solutions.
What do you need so much confidence and fear disappear?
You've been together for 29 years, which must mean you're capable of things together.
Use it as a strength and hold hands toward your solution.
We encourage readers to send questions and their misgivings to Kristiin by email at: heartbandssaela@gmail.com.
The questions will be answered here in the Family corner, of course anonymously and in full confidence.

It's a war!
Coleen Rooney is in charge of Johnny Depp's lawyer at the Wagatha Christie at Rebekah Vardy.
Coleen Rooney has asked David Sherborne to defend himself against the allegations of injury against Rebekah Vardy
After discussions between the footballers’ spouses, their acquaintances have failed to expect a dramatic deal.
Coleen Rooney has hired the star lawyer in Johnny Depp’s talk to defend himself in his so - called “Wagatha Christie” legal deal with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday states that Rooney ordered David Sherborne to defend herself against the allegations that she had committed an injury to Vardy, claiming that personal information was leaked to the media by her closed Instagram access.
The reports arrive a few days after the data were submitted to the Supreme Court, where Rebekah Vardy, who is married to the parishioner Jamie Vardy in Leicester City, suffered physically and spiritually from Coleen Rooney’s claim.
The paper notes that the 38 - year - old mother “was given serious panic attacks and anxiety attacks, so she was afraid to leave the house" and that Vardy, then seven months of age,“ had been hospitalized three times ... because of an attack due to the transfer and its consequences. ”
In addition to being an attorney of Depp in his case against the Sun, because of claims that the actor beat his wife, Sherborne, goes 50 years old with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in their personal language against Associate Newspapers, publishers of The Mail on Sunday.
After conciliation between the two football leaders failed, those who are familiar with dramatic acts in the courtroom will be expected to do so.
“ If you found the Depp trial a sighting, do not underestimate the future war of football characters, ” said one authority.
“ Now this is a real war, and Coleen leaves nothing, nor Becky either, and it will be emotional. ”
Coleen Rooney claimed that someone who used the Instagram access Rebekah Vardy had leaked up stories about her to a newspaper.
She was named “Wagatha Christie” after realizing how she lasted five months in gradually limiting the number of friends who could see updates to Instagram stories in her, until only Vardy’s account remained.
Coleen claims that they have written an unsaved story of Instagram, which would then appear in a gossip sheet.
In the Vardy case files, she claims that she was made to be a fraud after Rooney published the charges “to overlay, with the aim of causing great damage and great suffering. ”
Coleen’s attorneys have questioned these statements and have said that claims about her suffering are merely presented to the media and are drawing attention to the facts of the case.
One source said: “Becky’s documents are misleading, it’s all arousal."
It is the lawyer Paul Lunt of Brabner’s law firm in Liverpool that deals with Coleen Rooney, who has four sons with former England Master Wayne Rooney.
Vardy's at Kingsley Napley's law office in London, it's uncertain if she's still hired a lawyer.
Coleen Rooney's spokesperson refused to interview.
Bidens campaign refuses "Fox News Sunday" about an interview one week after Chris Wallace interview with Trump
In Trump’s interview with Chris Wallace last week, President Trump doubted that the coming president of Democrata, Joe Biden, would handle the issue flood that Wallace dropped on Trump.
We may never get an answer to that question — at least not for now.
On Sunday, Wallace informed viewers that Biden’s election team had told Fox News that he was “no free” in an interview.
“ In our interview with the President of Trump last week, he doubted that his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, would be in a similar situation,” said Wallace.
“ In the week, Biden’s election team asked for an interview, and they said that the former vice president was not free. ”
“ We keep asking each week, ” he added.
For months, Trump’s campaign team has criticized Biden for avoiding election meetings and a news conference while attending interviews during the crown virus epidemic.
Although Biden has recently resumed his campaign, Trump and his associates have continued to mock the former vice president for ‘ hiding ’ at their home in Delaware.
However, Biden’s efforts to attend public events have not been affected by his offer, since recent research shows that Biden has a good advantage in Trump both in national and in major fighting countries.
The average figures of Real Clear Police indicate that the president was under 7 percent in Florida, 6.7 percent in Pennsylvania, 8.2 in Michigan, and 6.4 in Wisconsin.
Trump worked in all four kingdoms in 2016 when he turned them over to the Republican when he won the White House battle.
In the recent Fox News Poll survey, Biden has a head start in Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, in all cases outside the shell line.
Studies also indicate that Biden has a slight head start in Ohio, North Carolina, and Arizona, three other important fighting countries in these elections.
And research indicates that countries that once were solid for the Republicans, such as Texas and Georgia, are now divided between Trump and the former vice president.
The President-in-Office of the Council who is standing for a second term of office in the White House is often voting for that President – and this seems to be the case now, in 2020, in the struggle between Trump and Bidens.
The most important issues have been the chronic virus and the economy of the epidemic — and the performance and history of the president in both cases.
Kanye West and his wrestling with bipolarism
The musician Kanye West asked his wife, Kim Kardashian, today, to apologize for any words he might have had in a spirit of generosity.
The head of the Psychologist’s team believes that he is acquiring his creative power for the bipolar disorder, but a psychiatrist says it is important that people take medicines to control the disease.
Not only is Rapparen Kanye West the most original and influential musician of all time, but he is as famous as the husband of realist Kim Kardashian.
To a large extent, his private life has been open.
It was very interesting when he announced earlier this month that he was offering himself to the president of the United States and held a heartless and disparaging speech.
Later, a peculiar one appeared on Twitter, claiming that his wife was trying to have him hospitalized.
Kim Kardashian later published a statement on Instagram in which she asked people to show understanding to their husband and family; he had bipolar disorder, and it would be difficult for his loved ones to help him if he did not want to seek help himself.
Since then, he has apologized to her publicly.
This famous family is not alone in dealing with this problem.
It is estimated that about one percent of people develop bipolar disorder.
Ferdinand Jónsson is a head of mental illness in London’s hospital, and he knows the disease well.
“ This disease can cause so much damage to the individuals and especially to the families and loved ones.
This mania can destroy relationships and jobs and cause unfathomable grief.
And then the other side, the depression, it's often very dangerous, because it's a high rate of suicide in that group.
So I thought it was nice for her to say that.
And it's just human and human," says Ferdinand.
“ He seems to have a very lively imagination, ” says Hoffman Unnsteinsson, president of the Gyilian, “and he is a fan of Kanye West.
If we are four - stranded double - basses, he is a hundred - stranded heavenly harps.
And he is so immeasurably creative, immeasurably powerful, and clearly in his powerful relationship thought, because one becomes aware of this connection thought that we who have been able to try to be courteous know so well."
Kanye West does not want to take antipsychotics, because he thinks they reduce his creativity.
He's been discussing the bipolar issues, including the record Ye.
He says it's his choice not to take medication.
“ It may seem to me that this creative element, which comes from this undisturbed thought of the relationship and unimaginable creative power of the fire that it has, is often the natural flaws of its suffering, and the valleys and dark basements and darkness. ”
Ferdinand, however, says it is important that people with bipolar disorder are treated.
“ If you have a lot of generosity or a lot of mania, you’re not making great things, you’re just on your side.
And like when people go into major depression, people are completely paralyzed by that condition," he says.
So you would advise Kanye West to take medicines?
“ Most certainly, ” says Ferdinand.
“ And especially to work with someone to find the right doses and this way to balance the fact that drugs help him most and destroy as they remember him and his abilities and his creative powers. ”

"Female" ambassador wants a gun, a armored car, and a shower vest - said the subordinates to the "Dark Kingdom"
Politically appointed U.S. ambassador in this country, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, is said to carry firearms in the CBS news story today.
Starting CBS’s report: “Despite being located in one of the safest kingdoms in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter is “weedy” about his safety since he arrived in Reykjavik last year. ”
Shows CBS in 12 diplomatas, executives, and former representatives, as well as individuals who know about the case.
Gunter’s conclusion was that it was necessary for the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs to request permission from the ambassador of the paranoid to move to a country armed.
He should also have wished for a armored car that traveled with him between places in Iceland and the southwest.
Although the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs refused to express itself as to whether any kind of threat would result in the security of the ambassador, representatives of the U.S. government said that the ambassador was told that Iceland was a safe country and that it was safe here.
Yet, according to CBS, lifeguards would have been advertised in Icelandic magazines, and if they were part of meeting the requirements of the ambassador.
According to CBS’ report, the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not wish to express its views on CBS.
However, according to their sources, the U.S. news agency has said that no request has been made by the local authorities.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter was spoken of as being armed as it would offend Iceland’s accommodation.
The ambassador was rewarded for giving abundant support to Donald Trump’s election campaign in the 2016 presidential elections.
He used to be a dermatologist in California.
Since taking over the Maya, Gunter said he has created a “incapable” environment at the embassy and has already had seven subordinates, called the Deputy Chief of Mission, the ambassador’s subordinates, who are also sent out diplomaticly.
They were all tested diplomats from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
The first one was sent away from the ambassador “because he did not look at his appearance. ”
He had already been preparing for a year and learned Icelandic.
The next one lasted only six months.
This led to a rotation of staff, and it was thought of letting Gunter make the most of them until he looked at one of them.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter loved the embassy staff to walk the territory of the “Dark State” and that they had dug away from it to the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs in Washington, D.C.
Foreign Ministry officials at D.C. are well aware of the situation at their embassy in Reykjavík, but have been reluctant to take action against the embassy’s lack of control in the light of Gunter’s links with the White House.
It is also said that Gunter had difficulties following orders from the State Department of Washington, who said he had refused to return to D.C. while the Covid-19 was leaving.
He left the embassy in the hands of his staff for months.
When he is said to have worked from his home in California, except for the commission of the foreign minister himself, Mike Pompeo, to return.
Returning the Return of the Return
Had finally received the order, Gunter returned to Iceland in May.
His new boss, Michelle Yerkin, then came to the country this month.
CBS has not received any answers to their inquiries to the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
The State Department did not want to communicate with CBS, nor with DV's inquiries.
Gunter is one of the many political ambassadors of Trump’s government, who have called attention to unusual behavior in the past few months.
Woody Johnson had a hard reaction when he arrived in the day trying to have the British Open Championship moved to golf at the golf course owned by Trump.
The ambassador in South Africa has also been under instructions for running his number two men and then trying to appoint her son for the job.
42% of U.S. ambassadors are appointed politically.
30% were politically appointed to Obama's government, and 32% were in George W. Bush's government.
In Seattle, conventioners and law enforcement officers all together because of Trump's plan to send the federal police forces there.

The Seattle Times reported that 16 were arrested for suspicion of attacks on police officers, for obstructing police activity, or for refusing to leave the area.
Poland will report on the European agreement on preventing violence against women
Poland’s Poland’s Rightwing Government says that it will withdraw from Europe’s agreement to prevent violence against women.
The Istanbul Convention is the world’s first binding piece of legislation aimed at preventing violence against women, but the Minister of Justice of Poland, Zbigniew Ziobro, describes the text as “harmful, ” which requires schools to teach children about sex from a social point of view.
Ziobro said on the weekend that on Monday he would start preparing a formal process for the country to tell about the agreement.
“ This ideologies are linked to attempts to change education in schools and leisure activities, in terms of learning, attitudes and convictions of the young generation of Poland, from the assumption that our opinion is wrong, that biological sex is old - fashioned and that everything is really about social culture. ”
Ziobro believes that the provisions of the agreement on education for children and young people as well as family relationships in the context of LGBT people are unacceptable.
“We also reject the LGBT feature in the discussion of family relationships, because this is an opinion that is held by the left community or homosexual groups who want their views to become binding laws,” he said.
On Sunday, the European Council said that it was “simplified” about Poland’s having to tell us about the agreement.
In Warsaw, about 2,000 people, including women and other groups of human rights fighters, protested on Friday, except for the offices of the right - wing organisations of Ordo Luis, who support the country’s declaration of the agreement.
“ We will not be victims, ” they called them.
Conventions were also held in other cities in Poland.
Poland signed the Istanbul Agreement to prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence in December 2012 and ratified it in 2015.

“Maurice Petty was one of the true pioneers of NASCAR and was involved in the Petty Enterprise’s process of building one of the top teams in NASCAR,” said Winston Kelley in a statement.
“ Although the victory of Petty is recorded as 212, it calls for well over 250 wins, if all the machines he built for his competitors are taken.
The boss will be remembered forever as the greatest mechanic in NASCAR history."
Lee Petty died in 2000 and Patricia, wife of Maurice Petty to 52 years of age, died in 2014.
He was also the cousin of the former rider, and the reporter Kyle Petty and Trent Owens, chief of the pickup race.
“ Although we now say goodbye to Maurice Petty, one of the true and hardworking pioneers and heroes of NASCAR, his inheritance and name will be stored in our memories, held on board and preserved forever,” said Kelley.
“ We send our deepest sympathy to the Petty family. ”

Serbia wants to increase military aircraft in ever - growing tensions in the Balkans
BELGRAD, Serbia (AP) - Serbia will strengthen its army and seek to buy more military aircraft as the tensions in the Balkans intensify, said President Serbia on Sunday.
president Aleksandar Vucic said that “certain attacks ” were on the purchase of fleets of battle engines, accusing the United States and other Western states of having armed neighboring Serbia, which is in NATO, as well as Cosovo, previously ruled in Serbia.
“ The Americans, the Turks, and the Germans take good care of their beloved offspring,” said Vucic, referring to Cosovo.
He said that the United States recently handed over to the Cosovo security forces a number of armored cars.
On a tour of the Serbian Air Force, Vucic told his people not to compete with “NATO’s contributions ” to the armed forces of neighboring nations and that“ for this reason we have come up to ourselves. ”
Vucic did not say what kind of military aircraft Serbia was planning to buy, but the media say his government has publicly requested 20 US attackers.
It turns out that at the request of Belgrade, Washington did not get an answer and that if it is rejected, the price of attack aircraft of Sukhai-25 from Russia is likely to be purchased.
Serbia, a military neutrality policy, has recently received a highly developed air conditioning system from Russia, which has also provided battle jets, attack helicopters, and armored vehicles.
China, also a Serbian alliance, has been given the country to use in warfare.
U.S. officials have been openly discussing criminal proceedings against Serbia if more weapons are to be transferred to the country from Moscow, especially weapons that could endanger security of the nearby NATO Member States.
In the Western and neighboring countries of Serbia, people are concerned about the armed forces of Russia and the Chinese in Serbia.
The tension is now increasing in the Balkans, where civil war in the 1990 ’ s took place.
The Atlantic League intervened in Serbia to stop the bloody actions of Serbia against the separation mechanisms of Cosovo-Albana in 1999.
Despite the formal search for membership of the European Union, the populist leadership of Serbia has further strengthened its political and military relationship with the Kremlin and Beijing.
Serbia, as well as Russia and China, does not accept the independence of Cosovo, which the United States and most Western countries have acknowledged.

Scientists have done a meta-analysis of coronary heart disease over the decades.
The main symptoms of coronary heart disease (also called ischaemic heart disease) are three: chest pain (angina), heart attack and heart failure.
Other symptoms may include palpitations and severe shortness of breath.
“ The chocolate contains nutrients that are good for the heart, such as flavonoide, methylxanthine, polyphenol and stearic acid, which can reduce inflammation and raise good cholesterol. ”
Good cholesterol, also called high - density fatty proteins, collects “bad” cholesterol — a type of cholesterol that narrows the arteries of the heart — and carries it into the liver.
The “bad” cholesterol (low density fatty protein) is broken down in the liver and is then removed from the body.
However, the new study does not examine the dose or type of chocolate consumed.
It is not clear whether participants ate dark chocolate, milk chocolate, or other chocolate candy.
The results were based on an older study which concluded that consumption of cocoa (which is found in chocolate) reduced the risk of heart attack.
Scientists believe that fluvonoids found in chocolate lower blood pressure and improve vascular function.
An vascular function refers to how well the blood distributes oxygen and nutrients around the body and removes waste materials.
Life style factors were not identified in the results of the new study.
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein said of the evidence that those who had admitted to eating chocolate are more likely to have healthy body weight.
She added that they could exercise regularly and experience less stress.
“ Each of these factors could have an independent effect on the health of the cardiovascular system, ” she added.
Coles replaces plastic toys with books for a new collection campaign
“ We’ve really listened, and that was a key element in our project preparation,” said Ronson.
“ We do not believe that people want to recycle the books — we believe that they will have them, but they can recover them from their homes if they want to. ”
Ronson said that the new campaign had been going on long before CAVID-19 came into existence, and despite her passage, she believes that the timing of the new campaign was “some good ” because of the amount of time that parents spend with their children.
Reporters have expressed concern that consumers have become tired of the ever - growing ingathering of their largest supermarkets, while Ronson says no sign of fatigue is yet seen.
“ We haven’t seen anything like that yet, but we’ve been keeping our eyes open for it all the time,” she said.
“ We report a lot of data, from week to week, month to month, to ensure that what we give away comes from our customers.
It was Cloes who ran the course for gathering campaigns such as Little Shop in Australia, the first of which in mid 2018 was the driving force behind the best annual market sales of the supermarket.
Woolworth followed along with Lion King Oosheis, who also helped the supermarket to large-scale sales, and now the environmentally friendly presentation campaign of Discovery Garden customers offers free plants and plant flowers.
However, the new collection campaign could have a less impact this time as UBS commentators predict increased sales in Australia’s largest size in the financial year 2021.
Ronson said that customers can expect a more diverse collection campaign in the future and that campaigns such as Little Shop are likely to be less common.
“ There’s a lot of information about gathering campaigns around the world that we look at, and we’re constantly getting inspiration from other countries,” she said.
“ We have to do this to make sure that we do more and more with our customers. ”
Been going 5 rings around the country for the summer
The photographer and the processor Jon Ragnar Jónsson, often known as Jon From Iceland, has been more and less like a whistle around Iceland since the world’s fall.
Jon completed his postgraduate research at Reykjavik University a few years ago, but now he is traveling and producing marketing material for individuals and businesses.
The summer began early at Joni, or in April, when he traveled all over the West and stayed in his car.
The end of a year, he's gone about five or six rings around the country.
Besides, he's been on countless day trips here and there.
What trip has come out of?
“ For someone like me who's always on the road and seen everything, it's hard to mention a favorite place.
The weather is more important and the society is more important.
After the opening of the roads in June, a great deal has recently been gone to highlands.
They're always on their way, because it's so much adventure to get to their destination.
The last trip there is a possible favorite trip of the year, but then we went 25 together to five big cars up by Riverside and there to Elfta Lake."
What lies ahead for you this summer?
“ It’s really exciting for me next time, but I was doing a choking course with DIVE, and now I’m taking a choking tour here and there in Iceland.
Then I was adding surfboards to my “dong sands ” so I get more out to sea than before.
I am so heading for a 10 - day “solo” trip with everything I need, but it will be seen later this summer.
Otherwise, I'll be very high in the next few days because it's not possible to look at that area throughout the year."
What place in Iceland is your favorite?
“ It’s always been hard to choose one place, but my life has been part of it since I remember.
Each summer, my family and I lived at the foot of B Bildermerikajul, and since then I have always felt good in that area.
I think I'm safe to say I've been there over 100 times."
With what location in Iceland do you recommend visiting?
“ I’m going to bring you one bead from every part of the country, but it’s: a Mullagsjuvet in the South, a support team in the East, Aldeyfoss in the North, a Red Sea Spirit in the West, a Baltic Sea Hill in the West, and last but not last... Meälevell up on Highland. ”
What is the most important thing in the trip?
“ I’m not going to land unless I have the following in my car: Good flashlights, hang rooms, lopapeys, hunting knifes, anesthetics, a refrigerators, and a bits... those who know me know what I’m talking about. ”
Searching for 24 rowers who are afraid to have drowned off an island in Malaysia
On Sunday, the KÚALA LUMPURR, Malaysia (AP) - the Malaysian authorities said that 25 rapists who fear to have drowned after jumping off a boat from Langkawi, a tourist island north of Malaysia, were being searched.
Zawawi Abdullah, a high - ranking officer of Malaysia’s land ministry, said that the police’s first information showed that only one of the 25 slanderers who had jumped off the boat had sinned to land.
The man who survived sought police help late on Saturday and has been detained while the case is under investigation, according to Zawawi.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslim roals have fled Myanmar because of military operations, many of which live in overcrowded refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Mouselmar is the majority of the population in Malaysia, which has been the frequent destination of boats that promise refugees a better life in another country.
Zawawi said that two ships and airships were used to search.
He said that mariners in the area and the authorities in the neighbouring country of Thailand will also be alerted to help with their search.
He gave no further information about the boat.
Last month, the Malaysian authorities put 269 rapists in custody and found a body on board a boat that suspected that they were being used to smuggle off the coasts of Langkawi, who said that he had been deliberately damaged so that he could not go back to sea.
In time, the Malaysian land service said that 269 individuals had been transferred from a larger ship with dozens of people who were thought to have died and that their bodies were thrown into the sea.
The prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, said that Malaysia could not accept any more roach refugees as they grapple with the economic cycle of the crown virus epidemic.
He said, however, that those already in the land would not be sent back to the sea.
In Malaysia, more than 2 million illegal immigrants live, as well as some 180,000 refugees and asylum seekers — including 101,000 roemen — who are registered at the United Nations Refugee Organization.
Aswan residents gather, watch, and return cargo of chocolate to Susann after a car pool
Aswan and Abu Simple went to Sudan with many tons of chocolate power on the international road on Sunday, at the foot of Wadi Karkar, when the driver died because of a heat stroke.
The locals were grouped to help the driver where he lay and save the sold goods.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, described his position, so that the driver was “misleading along our village; we could not just stand by.
We're supposed to help people in distress, no matter where they come from."
He added that the villagers had come to an ambulance to pick up the driver and then tried to save the truck’s cargo, estimated at £3 million.
Bahr said the villagers have been on the scene from morning to night and saved as much of their cargo as they could.
“ What we thought most important was to save the driver’s life, protect the vehicle, and reopen the international road, ” he said.
The villagers were willing to provide the injured driver with water and shelter, said Bahr, adding that they just wanted to ensure that he could get to and from the village safely.
There were already fragments on the council, which could make them worse.
“ The world epidemic itself is called upon by our elected representatives of the leadership and vision we expect during difficult times,” says a report written by Leonard Steinhorn, professor of communication at American University, and Mark Sobol, author and expert in organizational development and management.
“ But we are also faced with other forms of debt that are about our nation’s inherited sin and the racial injustice that has plagued our country from its founding. ”
The study examines familiar material in connection with the pathetic state of the council: lack of real relationship between categories, protocol limiting communication opportunities, excessive concentration of power in leadership stations, constant demands on capital movements, countdowns on interclass cooperation, negative impact on the daily media, the fact that the most important elections for senators are often biased and the final silence of minority groups.
It is also warned that the Congress will move more into the world of the pandemic, since such a system, which allows elections to be held in a local representative department without the need for Congressmen to travel to Washington, could still add to the existing problems.
If the idea of a remote conference was to be established, it would be a serious setback for attempts to increase inter-class relations, as the report says.
“ For the world’s sake, the Congress was forced to transfer most of its activities to the network, and we certainly understand why, ” the report says.
“ Despite its necessity, however, such virtue should not be interpreted as virtue. ”
The document says that the council needs “more than less communication between senators, face to face. ”
They need to study each other's districts better, have polite conversations to find common surfaces, and build a bond based on trust that can lead to increased understanding and solutions."
The call for politeness specifically meant in the week, when Ted Yoho, Congressman of the Republic of Florida, attacked Alexandriu Ocasio-Cortez, the congressman of the Democratic Republic of New York with the charges and his companions of the Republican Party agreed to attack Liz Cheney, Senator of the Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican in Wyoming with hostile words.
The Congresswoman Val Demings talks about the vice president's office, making Trump hear it for graces
The Congresswoman Val Demings (democrats, Florida) was not ashamed to discuss his interest in serving as vice president of Joe Biden’s potential government and express sincere gratitude for being taken for office.
This respected member of the assembly group of the blacks was in an interview with BlackPressUSA in the live broadcast for #FIYAH! The live part of the assembly and told her about her story, energy and commitment that has put her in the place she is today, and began with the words “You all know my story, and I grew up as a daughter of a maid and janitor in Jacksonville, Florida. ”
In the January trial over Donald Trump, one of the four prosecutors of the council was in the Senate.
Whatever the case with the Senate, Trump will be recorded in the history of being the fourth indictable president.
In an interview with the NPR of his office at Capitol Hill, this former prosecutor of the council said: “Was it worth it? It has been worth it every day”.
She added that even though the decision had been disappointing, the democracies had been obliged to follow the case regardless of their outcome.
In the interview, Demings made it clear that she is against Trump's captivating of Roger Stone's prison sentence, which was condemned to lie before the council (except for other crimes) as well as his favor against other criminals who were convicted of similar crimes, saying: “Abandonment to have your friends, who have lied and cheated to cover up your errors. ”
Delamings is at the top of the list of potential candidates for vice presidents, who also contains Karen Bass formann CBC (democrats, California), Stacey Abrams former senator of Georgia, senators Kamala Harris (democrats, California) and Tammy Duckworth (democrats, Illinois), Keisha Lance Bottoms mayor of Atlanta, Susan Rice former ambassador of the United States, and several others.
However, she claimed that only one person would decide who would volunteer with Joe Biden in the fall.
"It's Joe Biden."
Then she gave her hand to her mouth as she laughed and thought she was whispering to those who watched the broadcast, and added: “If you want to call... you can do it for my sake. ”
There is no doubt that regardless of each person’s political opinion, history will view this period as a time when American politics and attitudes developed.
It didn't go past Deming's.
She noted that the number of women involved in the offer to vice presidents of the United States is an opportunity to break through the rest of the “glar roof ” — especially for women of African origin.
“ These are exactly the opportunities I work so hard for me all my life to create for young boys and girls who have heard that their color is wrong, that they don’t have enough money or that they are of the wrong sex,” she said.
The Congresswoman determined to ensure that the Democratic Party Committee and Biden’s election team would advertise and work with the Black Press of America to get as many people to vote as possible.
“I’ll call Tom Perez (the chairman of the Democratic Committee) and I’ll put this at the top of my list,” promised Demings.
She agreed that this would have to happen now rather than later in the election campaign.
When she answered the comments of former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton that Trump could refuse to leave the White House, he lost the election, and another editorial saying that the president is preparing to get himself, came to life on Deming’s side: “To such an extent as to suggest that I should get myself caught up. ”
“ But who would ever do that other than Trump?
I think he's hating this job.
It should not be possible to get away with breaking laws and ignoring the constitution of this work.
I think he hates the job, but he can't stand to lose.
I can totally believe that the President will not want to leave the White House, but we have our way to take care of it, and if that happens, I just want to be with the people who make it happen."

Mr. Alibaba and Mr. Jack Ma are on trial in Gurugram for a dear former employee
Gurugram, July 26th: The company Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma, have been called to court in Gurugram after the company’s former employee claimed that he had been fired for protesting literature and false news in the company’s programs.
The case is set out in the Gurugram District Court, and according to reports, C.E. on July 29, Sonia Sheokand has issued a policy for Alibaba, Jack Ma, and more than 10 others.
The judge has also requested written answers from the company, according to Reuters.
Parmar, who worked at UC Web in Gurugram, October 2017, is requesting $268,000 in damages as reported by the Court of Justice.
“We are at the company’s commitment to the Indian market and the well-being of its employees, and its policies are in accordance with local law.
We can't express ourselves about current proceedings," said UC India in a statement.
“ The bill also contains “the list of sensitive words” that contain passwords in Hindu and English, such as“ India’s and China’s national borders” and “the war between China and India” that the UC Web claims to use to write literature on its systems in India, ” says Reuters.
Last month, the Ministry of Home Affairs banned 59 Chinese mobile telephone programs, including UC News and UC Browser, as it increased tension between the two countries.
New York City Firefighter's representative says it's "real" enough to exclude a white firefighter from the gentleman's office.
A New York City Fire Department agent who deals with the subject of multiplicity says it's "real" enough to keep a white firefighter from honorary so that flaggoers can all be black, according to a new story.
White firefighter Daniel McWilliams has referred to racial discrimination after being taken from a band of flagberries at a memorial mass in November 2017 to commemorate the fallen members of the Vulcan Society, a fraternity of black firemen.
Moreover, according to the New York Post, the main representative of the fire department in the field of diversity and availability, the lawyer Cecilia Loving, was the decision in the hearing of the New York Post Human Rights Department.
McWilliams is one of the three firemen in the department, who, in his historical image, is lifting the American flag of Ground Zero on the days after the 11th of September.
According to Mr. McWilliams, the fire department had chosen him to be the sole flagbearer in honor of the memorial ceremony.
Being a flag bearer at this ceremony was “a great honour and privilege ” for McWilliams, as stated in the CNN.
When he showed up at the ceremony, however, he was forbidden to participate in the honorary price of the then president of the Vulcan Society, Regina Wilson, for as she asserted, she had asked for all flagbearers at the Mass to be black.
She then asked McWilliams – a 29-year-old firefighter of New York City – to help in another way."
Among the claims she has asked him to do is to escort civilians and set up uniform firefighters away from Mass.
McWilliams claims in his plea that he asked Wilson if she was taking him from the gentleman because he wasn't black.
She confirmed that, he said.
Wilson, who has been working with the New York City Fire Department for 21 years and who also participated in the rescue work on September 11th, will have replaced McWilliams with one of the Vulcan members.
McWilliams claims that he left the memorial “to spare himself further shame, humiliation, and shame, ” when friends and colleagues heard what went between them, according to the New York Daily News.
When the black man Loving testified in court, a lawyer named McWilliams, Keith Sullivan, asked her: “Do you think asking everyone to be black in honor is not a distinction? ”
“ No, it isn’t, ” said Loving, according to the New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Loving if it was okay to ask that everyone be black in honor, as she said, “Absolutely. ”
Love explained that it would be acceptable for a white person to be divided outside a black person to “have our speciality and our different origins in order to create pride, unity, and support for one another. ”
McWilliams first called for discrimination based on race in the New York City Fire Department in January 2018.
He then appealed against Wilson, New York City firefighter, New York City, and unnamed individuals in May 2019.
Sullivan said that after McWilliams filed his complaint, Wilson’s supporters took revenge on him and threatened him.
At one point, one of her supporters will have laid hands on McWilliams, saying: “I have heard of you, they have told me that you would behave like this, and now you know who I am. ”
In the extract, Sullivan wrote that it had been “sacred” to exclude McWilliams from the gentleman at the Mass and to indicate that one was not a match for everyone in the Fire Department.
“If you’re a black person and a white person’s differences in the workplace, you’ll at most be reminded,” said Sullivan.
Wilson, according to the appeal, was given “consultation for one hour” due to her treatment with McWilliams.
Meanwhile, a white person who discriminates against a black person receives “a severe punishment, ” wrote Sullivan.
“ New York City fire forces have developed policies and processes to please members of the Vulcan Society, who act in a racist way, excuse their actions and help them ... and this needs to be stopped,” wrote Sullivan.
Bad walker and demanded money
One was arrested in the city after a attempted robbery in which he threatened to walk and tried to recover money from the person.
The man was saved in a prison cell.
Then the police were informed of a man with a knife in the middle of town.
The knife was confiscated and reported by the person.
More than eighty cases arrived on board the police in the capital city area from 17 to 05, and this morning six were saved in a prison cell.
Among other things, the police stopped a motor vehicle driver who pulled a trailer in Kjalarnesi, where the trailer equipment was in a very bad condition.
The shelter was set up and was intended to provide a means of transport to move it to town.
In that case, the police stopped the production of narcotics in the yeartown.
Two were arrested for the case and were released after a report.
There was also an announcement of people who shot up fireworks in Årbeð.
When the police arrived at the scene, they had escaped from the scene, “the shame is likely to be felt by the end of it, where it is still quite a long time ago. ”
Thousands of Khabarovsk residents still demand Putin’s resignation
Thousands of the citizens of the city joined the Russian city of Khabarovsk yesterday and protested the arrest of the governor of the province of the joint province sunk in East Russia and the establishment of his successor, who has never lived in the province.
The first governor, Sergei Furgal, enjoys great popularity and tens of thousands of citizens protested when arrested and arrested in Moscow earlier this month, claiming to have ordered murder of three businessmen 15 years ago.
During the recent week, Furgal was formally replaced as governor and his 39 - year - old brother, Mikhail Degtyarev, was appointed in his place, at the time of his little love for locals.
Is Degtaryev said to be inexperienced and, worse still, without any connection with Khabarovsk and called the citizens after his resignation soon.
They called them "Dangaryev" acting like a wind in the ears.
Yesterday’s protesters were less than in the first protests, or fifteen to twenty thousand, and the demands were the same as before: Furgal’s liberation and the resignation of Vladimir Putin, President of Russia.
“We want the governor to be released, because we think his arrest is highly likely to be illegal,” says the AFP news office of a 30 - year - old Protestant, Alina Slepova.
She claims that Kremlin agents had Furgal arrested “to defend their own interests, not the interests of the province. ”
Despite the clear violation of the requirement at the local meetings, the Khabarovsk police left the Protestants unsettled because of the Corona virus epidemic.
In Moscow, however, police arrested at least ten people who met in Pusjkin Square to show protesters in Khabarovsk support in action, says the British newspaper Guardian.
Furgal's Party of Freemandism is a group of hardline nationalists, and, by political commentators, is considered to be rather loyal to the Kremlin government in most cases.
The same political commentators, however, inform the BBC that the Furgals victory in the County Governors two years ago — which was great and undistorted — was a major shock for Putin and United Russia, while suggesting that Kremlin’s attack on the East was getting sick.
Furgal was arrested on July 9, and moved to Moscow, where he is awaiting trial.
He is accused of having ordered three murders in 2004 and 2005.
There were two of them, and the third went out of nowhere.
Sarah Rainsford, BBC reporter in Moscow, says that Furgal’s followers, who are very popular at home, are convinced that the charge and arrest have political roots.
They want to know why the authorities have waited until now for him, says Rainsford, 15 years after his alleged violation.

Homeless women with disabilities join the fight against COVID-19 in Chennai
Shenthi, a handicapped woman educated as a tailor, visits 250 homes every day to identify people with symptoms in Kodambakkam, a large Covid infected area in Chennai, where some 10,000 cases have been identified.
Workday starts early at her, 7:30 p.m., and ends at 4:30 p.m.
It recommends the heat in residents, asks for symptoms, and teaches them the importance of wearing masks, washing their hands regularly, and keeping away from others.
In fact, her work has led to the diagnosis and management of infection at a time when four positive individuals are involved.
Shenthi is one of 16,000 Chennai employees who do their homework but are not health care professionals.
According to the government, the project has contributed to a 50 percent reduction in positive cases, in Chennai’s daily count, while increasing in other Tamil Nadu provinces.
Shenthi says that not all residents are cooperative translations.
She adds: “Most people cooperate when a woman with disability approaches them.
Some, however, become frustrated.
But this is not to worry about.
I think people should be safe.
When I come back the next day, the people are polite.
It helps to build a good relationship."
And there are more women like Shunthia who reside in the gistyl city for women with disability and put the fight against the Covid-19 team.
Not far from Kodambakkam, Kavitha, who also has disability, has also been involved in the campaign as an overseer.
Even though Kavitha owns a special bicycle, she goes on a walkway to meet people and hold her cape.
“ I’m happy, ” she says, “I want to see them go down to maybe 100 a day.
I'm sure we can get that."
On the first floor of the giant where the two dwellers are Matilda Funceca, a basketball woman who uses a wheelchair, and Manimekalai, a teacher, and they send all the data that travels from about 40 women into Chennai’s web server.
Matilda says he's not afraid to get infected by the Crona virus.
“ When we help others, ” she adds, “God protects us. ”
When asked what steps she takes, Manimekalai says: “I use a mask, keep away, and wash my hands often.
I also drink Kabasura Kudineer, a sidedha drink that enhances the immune system."
A few months ago, when the crown virus first arrived in Chennai, these handicapped women guarded their time and abilities to sew masks for health care professionals in the city.
Dr. Aishwarya Rao and the government of the gistyla, as well as Dorcas, who runs the cloud, says: “They adapt to every moment’s needs.
In the past, masks were missing, and they were not left behind.
Now it's time to intervene in society, and they answered the call."
In Tamil Nadu, there are now 200,000 Corona virus infections after 6989 new cases in the last 24 hours, which is also the largest number of infections detected in one day, according to official data.
Eighty-nine have died, and 7758 have recovered over the past 24 hours.
The total number of infections in the state is now 206,737.
Police are trying to find the last trip to Helensburgh
In Helensburgh, investigators who investigate the death of a youth are now trying to set a timeline for his last journeys.
The body of 19-year-old Kirk Allan was found at Johnson Court's home at 6:25 p.m. on Saturday.
A 30 - year - old was arrested, and the police confirmed on Sunday that he had now been charged with the death penalty.
He'll be in court at Dumbarton on Monday.
Police chief Steve Martin said: “Our family and friends are with Kirk during these difficult times.
Policemen will continue to work with the community and support it.
Our research continues to get a full picture of what took place, especially Kirk's last days before his death, but we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the death."
South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox report on their experience of discrimination
The last few weeks have seen that many skeletons are still in the closet in connection with racial discrimination in sports in South Africa.
A upbuilding conversation needs to take place and action is needed to welcome everyone to sports.
Ashwell Prince, a former critic star at Proteas, let his former white teammates hear about it and accused them of racial prejudice by saying that he and other black men are “fellow players. ”
Prince said that Protaas’s black players have been publicly referred to as “marriage players ” by their white associates.
He added that it was sad that even though black players such as Makhaya Ntini and now Browsingso Rabada reached the top sports record, some people still associated with the farewell talk.
Prince, who is now a Cape Cobras coach, dropped this comment on the United Coalition for Sport and Community Based Organisations (UCSCBO) web meeting on Thursday night.
The goal of the contemporary world is to continue the burning discussion of historical racial discrimination in South African sports.
“ Just as I said when I ease social media, it’s not my intention to come and drag people’s names into the area, but these are real events...
"You're doing everything right, but you're getting sick"
Paul Roberts, an ex - musician and a carpenter who became a programmer at NASA, is now working for a software company.
He and his wife, a former nurse at the Methodist Hospital who regarded himself as an optimist, held out an amateur magazine on the Internet and attended Comic Con events earlier in years.
Once a week, they'll blow them with two of their daughters, a son-in-law and a 7-year-old grandchild, and they'll play a very exciting Uno game.
“ They are amazing nerds, ” says Roman, 38, about her parents.
Sheryl Roberts, 65 years of age, is aware of the hazards of the pandemic — diabetes, asthma, and heart disease that can put her at increased risk.
Her husband has a chronic lung disease and a stem that previously holds a blocked coronary artery open.
“ We’ve been so careful, very careful, and keeping away from people,” said Sheryl Roberts.
Her husband began to work from home in the spring, when the luggage warped hard on Washington states, New York, and other areas around the country.
Paul has been in a unique market for “ga ore-time ” and his only real date for the last few months was Sheryl when they began to examine wildflowers through the car window.
Their younger daughter also went gently.
But then she came home from work one day in the middle of June and thought she was allergic.
Soon she had cough, fever, headache and diarrhoea, and lost all sense of taste and smell, which are typical of the crown virus’s symptoms.
“ She said: “I don’t know what’s going on, Mother, but I was wearing a mask, wearing gloves, washed my hands,” said Sheryl.
“ You do everything right, but you do it. ”
Elaine Roberts, who was diagnosed with positive crown virus infection, did not become seriously ill.
However, her parents made things much worse.
Paul Roberts and his wife began to sneeze and then cough, just like their daughter, and they had a lot of heat and pain in their body.
Then he “began to be sick, to be disciplined quickly, ” said Sheryl Roberts.
On June 22, he became confused.
He was concerned about the oxygen level.
It was low, and she asked their older daughter to take him to an emergency room for the second time in two days.
According to a new book, the former royal couple thought it to be “hounded ” in the Queen’s Christmas bed
MEGHAN Markle and Harry Bretaprist felt that his grandmother, Queen of Britain, had “remembered ” them in their Christmas season.
The couple’s new life story, “Finding Freedom, ” indicates that they were viewed by those in the gallery who could be seen in the Christmas talk.
Pictures on the desk at which the queen sat included William Bretaprins, Kate Middleton, and their three children, Karl Bretapriss and his wife Kamilla as well as Prince Philip.
However, Meghan and Harry were nowhere to see, despite Archie’s birth in May, but the boy was mentioned as her Majesty’s “abstaining grandson. ”
The new August book also states that Meghan and Kate Middleton “were never friends, ” since they“ found it difficult to get across superficial courtesy ” and met only a few times.
Yesterday, it was claimed that Harry and his brother William began some years before his relationship with Meghan began, but that it reached the climax of the marriage of William and Kate Middleton.
The Duke of Sussex felt that he was “a warner ” of events with his brother and Kate Middleton, claiming that“ he wanted to change things long before Meghan came into existence. ”

Labor officers were accused of wanting to work “at home forever ” after protesting Boris Johnson’s appeal to people to return to work.
When civil servants and civil servants were angry with the members of the household, the members of the civil service were told to ask for help when their superiors ordered them to return to their workplaces.
Mr. Andrew Percy, former minister, said that the necessary public service as a version of passports was stopped while employees in the public market had worked hard to keep the community going during the crowning virus epidemic.
“ It is unacceptable for people to refuse to return to work while workers in warehouses and factories throughout the country have continued to work so that public workers could eat during this time,” he said.
“ Many of these employees now want to leave for summer vacation, but they cannot because of the people who refuse to go back to their workplaces, although they are safe.
Chiefs of Labor cannot maintain this policy of staying at home forever – especially now that we know that people can return to work safely."
Following the request of the Prime Minister last week, Alex Chisholm, newly appointed Director of Public Service, announced that the Ministry was to “return from the retirement of civil servants to their place of employment, and speed up their return to their place of employment to August 1st”.
The public and public workers’ labor unions expressed the need not to meet this requirement to their social partners, who speak of some 200,000, and said that this was about politics.
A spokesman for the civil society of public and public workers, the largest union of public workers in Britain, said that the demand to return to work was “not provided with the health and safety of our social workers in the first place, or to strengthen the economy.
This is determined by political pressure from members of the household class who demand that public service be used as an example to get others back to work.
Our advice to social workers is clear: If you do your job at home and someone in your department asks you to come back to the workplace, do not take it as of course that you have to do it."
The issue is due to increasing displeasure with a delayed version of passports because employees work at home, but some 400,000 people are now said to wait for their applications to be processed.
The Ministry of Industry has now announced that it will “seek to speed up ” applications from the British for travel in the next two weeks and from those who have been waiting for a passport for more than four weeks.
A public and public workforce union has admitted that some have had to wait up to 143 days for passports, but it claims that “small and often narrow offices” make it difficult for 4000 people to stay away from the necessary jobs.
The former government minister, David Davis, urged leaders of labor unions to “be reasonable ” and seek ways of cooperating with governments to get people back into their jobs.
He added that if he were in government, he would ask a union officer: “What is it you want, that people stay home all summer? ”
However, various major British companies have also ignored Johnson’s recommendation to return to work.
A study of large workplaces with a total of 400,000 employees revealed that only about 40,000 of them have returned to their workplaces.
The emphasis on history can play an important role in reconciliation
The gallows have improved, but understanding and contentment should be the goal.
The school system is partly to blame for this lack of knowledge and understanding.
Too little is taught by Australian history.
The fact is that without radical action, the only teaching that specifically deals with our history — “Saga Australia ” for the 12th grade — will die out within the next five years or even earlier.
Last year, only 628 students in the Victorian country completed a total of 49,324 high school studies, or only 1%.
Over the past six years, this figure has been reduced by almost half, but nearly 100 students attend the course each year.
The main reason that so few students choose to learn about Australia’s history in the 12th grade is that little has been done in previous years to interest them.
History is not even a unique field of study, but it falls under the wider “inquisition. ”
Therefore, students of the 7th and 8th grade only complete one brief unit on “the settlements and islands of Torres Strait and their culture. ”
During the 9th and 10th years, there is another unit for Australia during the world war.
For many Victorian students, this is all that is taught about Australia’s history during primary school years.
In the 9th and 10th years, there is a second optional unit for the 1750-1918 season.
It is important to take three steps to save an Australian history in Victorian schools.
First, a story must become an independent subject, such as English, mathematics, and science.
Since history is only taught as part of science, it has little space in the curriculum.
It is usually taught by people who have a general education within science but have not educated themselves in history.
Historic skills, such as analysis of data, are complex.
To ensure that such skills are taught in a accessible and exciting way, we must hire other specialized historians.
Third, Australia’s history from 1788 to 1914 will have to become an obligation.
Students appreciate what they know.
So many of my former students chose not to learn Australia’s story in the 12th year of study, as they would have had to learn the material from scratch.
Knowledge of the story alone does not reveal a deep gap between races.
But without it, as can be seen in the Victorian curriculum, the project is hopeless.

Aaron Elis in a European - Isaac final game split in half
Aaron Elis Trøndarson has come to a final game on the European seat in the Danish finals section of football.
Isaac Bergmann Johannesson played only the first half of a game with Norrkoping’s top team against Falkenberg’s bottom joint in Sweden.
As the team continued to play the final game in the European Society’s Forerunner, Elis was in the ranks of OB in Denmark.
The OB will meet the AGF or FC Köbenhavn in the final game, depending on whether the team ends up at the end of the final tour of the final section of the Danish Election Department later today.
Aaron Elis played all the games in 1–1 level with Horsens on the field today, but OB had won the first play of the team in the home field, 3–1 and thus won a total of 4–2.
Isaac was at the beginning of Norrkoping, which was unexpectedly 2-0 below after the first half of the Falkenberg bottom line in the Swedish prime section.
At the beginning of the second half of the year, Norrkomping made a threefold split, and he was one of those who had to be replaced by Isaac.
Norrkoping reached an even value, but Falkenberg reached 3–2 in 89 minutes.
Yet it was still time for Norrkoping to match hell at the last moment, 3–3.
Norrkoping remains at the top, with 24 points, four points ahead of Elfsborg and five points ahead of Malmö, which will play well later today.
Falkenberg was able to get off the ground for now, but it is a step ahead of Helsingborg and Kalmar, which has a good game.
Conventions on the National Festival of Crown Virus Times
Anna Lilja, who founded the Facebook group “My Festival of Nations 2020” to gather information about the national festival that the islanders intend to hold next weekend.
Many people are going to tent in their gardens, and to rejoice with friends and relatives.
Anna Lilja had a chat with Hjuta in the Show on The Wave.
“ There’s nothing yet that’s very exciting, too, because there’s 600 people in the crowd, so they’re clearly going to do something, ” says Anna Lilja.
Something about the islanders going to have tent parties at home.
“ People have talked about being with their own [festival], perhaps tenting in the garden and raising up the family as they always do at this time, ” says Anna.
“ You expect people to spend time with their people.
It is likely, though, that many will simply not be there “but still have some small celebration somewhere else. ”
The National Festival Committee is now working hard to rebuild the tickets bought, but Anna thinks that many locals are planning to secure their next year’s holiday.
“ People are even investing in the media now, leaving value for 2021.”
“I’m a great National Festival person, I love the preparation and everything around it, but sometimes something comes into life that you can’t control, and then it’s just that,” says Anna, but according to the report, there has been something that people have to say about whether the islanders can’t leave the National Festival “that way once.”
Anna Lilja claims to have not formed the group for herself or to encourage people to celebrate their own national festival, but to gather sources of commercial holidays in the islands that year.
“ What did people do in these strange times?
I'm not going to use this in one thing or another, but then there are some people who use such a source for something, but I was just creating some territory where people can put what they're doing."
It will also be installed every year on the Foaming Nut, which is on fire.
“ I think a lot of people are excited about getting burnt Friday night.
The only thing that, of course, makes a point is that the prediction is no speck."
“ This fire will come on, but it just has to be shown how it will be, ” says Anna Lilja.
The entire interview with Anna Lilja can be heard in the player below.
Will Prince Andrew be referred to in a new file on sexual crime?
The British royal family is now preparing to respond to potential new information in legal documents about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
A U.S. judge has ordered that classified documents on Epstein and Maxwell be made public.
Among these 80 pages of documents is Maxwell’s testimony from 2016
The display of these pages may also put high pressure on Prince André, in which there is communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015
Virginia Roberts, the alleged sex slave of the defamed American financier, claimed in 2015 that she had been forced to engage with Prince André.
Prince Andrew is now preparing to defend himself against the potential publication of information this week with even more damaging accusations of his friendship with the child addict Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged senior, Ghislaine Maxwell.
In the week, U.S. district judge Loretta Preska appointed 80 secret legal documents in connection with Maxwell and Epstein, which number hundreds of pages.
The display of these hugely large documents would be a shock for the 58 - year - old Maxwell, who has held much of her testimony before lawyers in 2016, including what her lawyers have said to be “faithful questions” about her sexual history.
They could also put a great deal of pressure on Prince André, where one of the documents contains communications between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts, the alleged sex slave of the defamed American financier, claimed in 2015 that she had been forced three times to engage with André.
Andrew has repeatedly rejected these claims.
It appears that last year’s 2015 computer mail released by the BBC indicated that Andrés asked Maxwell for help in responding to Robert’s claims.
We have no doubt that the Duke will have a rebellion
There he told the superior woman: “Let me know when we can talk, and I have some questions I need to ask you about Virginia Roberts. ”
Maxwell replied: “When you have time available, call me. ”
Last night, a source who stands close to Andrew said: “The Duke of Jorvík has done nothing wrong, so we are not concerned about the opening of a legal document.
As the U.S. courts have tried to point out, this does not mean that an accusation is true even if it appears in legal documents.
U.S. courts have urged the media and the public to exercise full caution in dealing with the allegations made in legal documents.
We totally agree.
We have no doubt that the Duke will have complete rebellion in the next few weeks."
Maxwell is now in custody at the Manhattan detention center waiting for the arrest of some of Epstein’s legal victims from 1994 to 1997.
It is also accused of harmfulness for refusing information about his misuse.
She rejects all the charges.
Maxwell last spoke to lawyers in April and July of 2016 in connection with Robert’s late name, Giuffre, which she mentioned after marriage.
About 40 pages out of a total of 418 witnesses were made public last year, but after the decision of the judge Presna, New York, last week, more could be opened in the first place on Thursday.
Lawyers Maxwell got one week to present an appeal.
Epstein was found dead in his prison cell in New York last year when he was being tried for sexual crimes.
The police are looking for criminal gangs to attack the streets of Edinborg.
Three attacked a man in Edinborg and injured him, which could be permanent.
The 29 - year - old victim of Drum Street, Gilmerton, was attacked between 23:00 and 23:30 on Saturday.
The Scottish police reported that he had been moved to the royal hospital with serious injuries.
The investigator Dale Miles, who directs the study, said: “It was a violent and impenetrable attack. ”
The suspects fled towards Newtoft Street.
One was thought to be in his 30 ’ s, about six inches [ 180 cm] tall, and it was highly grown.
He was short-cut and dark-haired in a white shirt, dark pants and dark shoes.
A detective Miles said: “I'm asking everyone in this area at the time of the attack and saw something suspicious about coming out. ”
The ambassador wants to carry a gun in Iceland
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, U.S. ambassador in Iceland, wants to carry a gun in this country and wants to increase security.
He is said to have been “weaning ” about his safety since he arrived last year.
This is stated in CBS’ report, which also says that this will be done by Gunter, even though he is working in “one of the safest kingdoms of the world. ”
Gunter is said to have asked the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs to ask the Icelandic government to carry a gun.
Then he has asked for a armored car and a vest that protects him from stabbing.
According to CBS’ sources, the Ministry has repeatedly announced to Gunter that it is not in danger in Iceland.
According to CBS’ report, the State Department of Iceland did not provide information on whether a request has been received from the United States on the possibility of armed action by Gunter, because the authorities do not express themselves on the security arrangements of foreign ambassadors.
Even so, newsmen say no requests have been made.
Then, after his sources of authority, CBS has also been told that Gunter should not seek to carry weapons, because he would be offended in this land.
Gunter is an inexperienceist who has been a dermatologist in California for years.
He's active in the U.S. Repuy Republican Company, and powerful President Donald Trump.
He recently drew attention to the land when he said of the “invisible China virus. ”
CBS’s sources also say that Gunter has greatly reduced the staff member of the U.S. Embassy in Reykjavik.
He already had seven secondary staff at the embassy from May of last year.
Among other things, he accused them of being part of the so - called “Deep Kingdom, ” which is supposed to be the network of U.S. officials working against Trump, and he failed to feel angry that one of them was carrying snow into his office.
The ambassador traveled to Washington DC in February for a conference and refused to return to Iceland for several months, according to CBS’s sources.
Gunter is said to have wanted to work from California, but eventually Mike Pompeo, U.S. Foreign Secretary, had to order him to return and did so in May.
The home game form is a key element for Jose Mourinho, who says Tottenham has easier games to do when fans are allowed to come back at games
With the help of Jose Mourinho, Tottenham Hotspur has not lost a game at home since the Selection Department started again, but he says that it would be much easier to maintain a good gang at home if the spectators were released.
A question has won 12 wins at home during this season, but it has lost four times — only one of the six above them has lost more at home.
The coach Portuguese said that while such a victory would be possible without the adherents, it would be easier to maintain it if they were there.
“We have to do this with the fans, and without them we can build up some kind of fortress, where the game plan is in the foreground,” he said.
“ But I think it would be a lot more powerful to do it with the fans, so the emotional side of the game will be added, which will only be achieved with fans in the home stadium. ”
Mourinho believes that with stronger competitions, it will be increasingly difficult to maintain the long careers of his home life known from Chelsea, or that Liverpool has built up in the past three seasons.
But this is also a key factor in determining whether the team is achieving its goals at the end of the season, especially in equal games and neighboring teams, as the atmosphere on the field can be a big difference.
“ I believe that the policy in the lead department is that it is now becoming more and more difficult to beat these unfavorable values because of what has become good. ”
“ However, it’s important to be strong at home and at the end of the season have drawn in many points with wins at home games. ”
“ I’m happy with the result from home games lately, without the fans, but we need them back.
I picture a victory against Arsenal with the court full of Tottenham fans.
It is compassion, which is built up gradually."
Buyers are excited about the afterlife style of Lovely Banks
“More is better,” is evidently the motto of new owners of huge real estate in the neighborhood of Lovely Banks, recently sold at $1270.
Interesting merchants in search of a life style property near the center of Geelong moved to see this 1.35 ha of land, where 14 cars, swimming pool, and Corio Bay view can be found.
Joe Grgic, a real estate dealer in Harcourts, Northgeelong, said that the offer in the land that Cuddihy Court 1 had been approved within 10 days of being placed on the market.
Broome Cottage in Ocean Grove again for sale
A home chosen for isolation
“ We received a number of offers from various parties,” said Grgic.
“ The property was sold to a very excited resident. ”
The property is provided with a two - floored four - room house, which includes a private bathroom that is large enough to accommodate a sofa.
The new owners have a choice of three rooms and can use the kitchen and upgrade the outdoors with a view of the pool.
“ It lay in the way the property was composed, that it was three acres, and that it was in this place,” said Grgic.
“ There came interested merchants from Melbourne who wondered what the estate was in the middle but still with a rural cloud.
“ I have people who are missing and buyers who are still looking. ”
He said that the spacious storage area, which includes a double garage and a free - standing cloud that accommodates 10-12 vehicles, is perfect for industrialists or to store trailer and trailer.
Thinking His Safety Wars in Iceland
“ Despite being appointed as the most secure country in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been paranoid about his security since he arrived in Reykjavik last year.”
This is how CBS News’s detailed discussion of the U.S. ambassador in Iceland begins, but this mimics several sources of CBS from the U.S. Foreign Service.
CBS’ discussion claims that Gunter wanted him to be given special permission to carry firearms by the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
He should also have wished for a armored car, as well as for ideas about a vest that might protect him from stabs.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs refused to state publicly whether Gunter’s safety is actually threatened in Iceland, but according to information from government officials, Gunter has repeatedly been told that he is not in any particular danger.
Despite this, the U.S. Embassy in Iceland recently announced that it is being done to sleep worry Gunter.
While the U.S. Foreign Ministry does not express itself on the evidence of security operations in connection with its embassy, it always states that security is guaranteed in a preventive way.
The Ministry does not answer questions regarding Gunter’s request for weapons to be deployed and the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not wish to say whether the United States formally requested the ambassador to carry firearms, nor does it usually say that it is not expressing itself on the security issues of foreign agencies.
According to his Icelandic sources, however, CBS has said that the request was never made, and according to three U.S. officials, Gunter was acquired from these plans, which could offend Icelandic residents.
CBS’ discussion also discusses the various problems that have been related to the U.S. embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed ambassador last year, but he will already have replaced his foreign minister seven times.
Thus, the first vice president is said to have been preparing for his work for a long time and learned Icelandic only to have been denied the position at the last minute because Gunter “did not listen to him ” at their first meeting.
His successors have not gone much better under Gunter’s rule.
U.S. Foreign Ministry officials are informed of the position of the Icelandic embassy, but they are reluctant to intervene in matters related to the President.
In addition to all of this, Gunter is said to be reluctant to comply with the various rules of foreign service and to respect the order of authority.
Gunter traveled to the United States in February to participate in a Washington conference, and he is said to have refused to return to Iceland to his temporary career for months, and this in the middle of a pandemic.
In fact, Gunter would have wished to do his job in telework and said that he would not return to Iceland unless the Foreign Minister himself, Mike Pompeo, specifically wanted it.
According to information from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs, Gunter had decided to take his personal leave to the end of the conference and the crowned virus epidemic took further for him, but according to CBS’ sources, many within the Ministry of Justice have asked Gunter to return to Iceland, but not before May, following Pompeo’s contact with him and kindly asked him to return to the Committee in Iceland.
CBS’ discussion also reports the enemy attacks of Gunters in Iceland, especially in connection with a tit, where he calls the Cronum virus “the invisible China virus” and has received great criticism.
Gunter is one of many, almost inexperienced, of ambassadors appointed during the reign of President Donald Trump of the United States.
Sachsin Pilot against Ashok Gehlot; The Bharatiya Janata group says the government crisis in the state; The Congress wants to vote
Ashok Gehlot said that if needed, the Congress Party would need to produce office protests outside the prime minister’s home.
On Saturday, a day after a peaceful protest against Raj Bhawan in Jaipur, Ashok Gehlot, the prime minister, said that if it took place, Congressmen would need to meet the President and to make statements outside the Prime Minister’s home to lead the crisis to the state.
At the Congressional Assembly meeting, Gehlot indicated that it was planned to hold a vote to check whether the majority of the members of the Congress and the joint forces were with him at the power struggle.
“He said the government has a majority and wants to vote, ” says Mahesh Joshi’s statement on the Congress Party’s front party, after the meeting.
The General Assembly was held at a hotel where the members of Gehlot’s parliament have remained in the last days.
“ The secretary - general asked us to be prepared to stay longer in the hotel.
If necessary, he said, he would meet with the president and also hold a peaceful protest outside the home of the prime minister," said the deputy leader.
The prime minister of Raistan may call the Congress together and let the Congress group demonstrate its majority, said the General Assembly leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday, and indicated that the Bharatiya Janata party's plot to overthrow Ashok Gehlot's government.
“ The land is now governed by law and constitution.
Governments are formed and function with the authority of the people.
Bharatiya Janata’s plot to overthrow Raistan’s government has come to an end.
This is insulting to 80 million people in Raistan.
The prime minister must call the council together for the truth to come before the land," said Gandhi in the title of the Hindu.
Ashok Gehlot, the prime minister of Raisthan, told Congressmen on Saturday that he was prepared to go to India’s president to make sure that what he calls “Bharatiya Janata’s Councilman ” to hold a vote of confidence.
Gehlot, who protested for hours at the home of the governor Kalraj Mishra on Friday to press a congressional meeting, met with the Congressmen and the government on Saturday, and after the meeting new proposals were made and approved by the government.
Mishra asked Gehlot last night to put in the assembly request again and referred to six objections.
The proposal will soon be sent to the governor.
Gehlot has accused the governor of delaying a parliamentary meeting where he is “under pressure ” to slow down the vote that determines trust in his government.
When Gehlot met his government, Bharatiya Janata, the Committee of Ambassadors, met with the government leader Satish Poonia and Head of Government Gulab Chandra Kataria, to discuss the State’s COVID-19 position.

Spencer Gram, a actress with a ditch outside a restaurant in Manhattan
NEW YORK – Spencer Grammar’s actress said he was trying to calm an angry man when he cut her arm and put her friend in the back outside of a restaurant in New York City last Friday.
Gram, who is 36 years old, told US Weekly that she and her friend had done what everyone else had done in the same situation as they were trying to keep things from getting worse when they were attacked.
GAM and her 32-year-old friend sat at the front desk at The Black Ant in the East Village district of Manhattan about 11:30 p.m.
Friday, when a man walked up to them and demanded a payment, the restaurant was being closed.
Gram and her friend were hurt when they tried “to resolve a conflict between an unknown man and other local visitors, ” says the police.
The man ran off the place after hurting the right arm of Gram and stabbed her friend into the lower back with an unknown point-of-point, said the police.
Nobody's been arrested.
Gram, who speaks for Summer in the “Rick and Morty” series, formerly played in the “Greenek” series at ABC Family, is the daughter of “Frasier” star Kelsey Gram and the actress Doreen Alderman.
Gram said that both she and her friend expected to recover quickly.
Neither of them had serious internal injuries, she said.
In a declaration to the US Weekly, Gram thanked those who responded on the scene and the Bellevue Hospital staff who scoffed at them and mentioned the “incredible struggle ” of this staff at the crown virus epidemic.
“ It touched us very much to have an opportunity to thank them in person, ” said Gram.
“I don’t want to be like McGregor and show my money...
I'm here to help people" – Chimaev after a historic evening on UFC Fight Island – RT Sport News
The battle capper Khamzat Chimaev from Russia is now referred to as the next star UFC after registering in history on Fight Island, but he says he does not aim to flag his fortune in a generous way like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev bore the superintendent Rhys McKee in their battles at Abu Dabi on Saturday night when he defeated his rival when three minutes and nine seconds had passed by the first round by having his blows blown in the floor.
The victory recorded Chimaev’s name in UFC history for the shortest time between wins in the modern history of the race, where only 10 days had passed since he won British John Phillips in the same decisive way, in interim.
Chimaev, who has a victory ratio of 8-0, received a $50,000 bonus for the evening’s work against McKee and has so fully captured the MMA world’s attention that it is now called “Khalib 2.0”, which is said to be an inescapable comparison because of the great odds between the light failure of Chimaev and the UFC champion, and since he was born in Téténia, which is near native Khabib in Dagestan.
Despite recent fame and financial benefits, the translator Chimaev has said that he would not like to flag his fortune like the MMA money machine Conor McGregor or his peer in the box world, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
“ I don’t just do this for me, I do this for everyone I can help.
“ I don’t want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, showing my money or something like that.
I want to help people," answered Chimaev when he was asked on Fight Island how he would use the bonus.
Among other things, he has noticed Conor McGregor’s teammates and active Twitter user Dillon Danis, who wrote on the community centre that he could “immediately” defeat Chimaev with the release.
It was not a poisonous answer from the combater named “Borz”, or“ wolf ” in his native language, who said that he would “malize Danis with his eyes closed. ”
Chimaev, who is now in Stockholm, Sweden, after moving to the 19 - year - old country, may not be able to lose his financial strength, but he is clearly shy about flirting his fighting skills.
“ I can paint anyone...
How many fighters are in the Starfleet Division?
I can paint them all," he said.
“ Give me 77 kilos of champion (beautiful), 84 kilos of champion (millitious), I paint them both, the same day. ”
The Israelis continue to protest the reaction of the Prime Minister at the pandemic
JERUSALEM (AP) — Thousands of Israel protested against the prime minister in the country on Saturday, the biggest protest outside of Benjamin Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem.
The protests have lasted for a few weeks but started because of what critics consider the government’s neglect to respond to the crowned virus epidemic after its initial failure to control the virus.
The charges against Netanyahu for corruption have further contributed to the protest.
“Bibi, go home, ” stood on one of the Protestant signs.
On another issue, it said: “Everybody sees the Emperor has lost his clothes. ”
Hundreds of Protestants also gathered outside Netanyahu beach in the prosperous town of Caesarea.
Last week, the police used water guns to scatter groups in Jerusalem.
After what has been called rapid and unorganized economic re-opening in May, the average number of new cases per day went up to 2000.
The economy of the country has been hit by the restriction of the virus and unemployment has increased to nearly 20%.
The protesters say that the government’s financial assistance was far from sufficient.
The protests took place in the shadow of a prosecution of corruption charges against Netanyahu, which began again in the month.
The hearing will begin in January.
He is accused of fraud, fidelity, and bribery in a series of scandals.
Hundreds of Protestants gather in the middle of Los Angeles to join with Protestants in Portland
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) — About 300 Protestants gathered in the city centre of Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon in support of two - month - old movements in Portland, Oregon, where attention is focused on federal police after conflicts with Protestants.
Similar Protestant meetings took place in many parts of the United States, including Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York City.
The protests in Los Angeles were organized by the Refuse Fascism and Youth Liberation Front groups.
The group joined Los Angeles police headquarters at First Street and Main Street, followed by a security center in the big city area.
The participants also moved to the Alameda area on road 101, but left it later.
Part of the people were seen breaking windows in federal buildings in the middle of the town, and fudges were written on federal labels.
At least one person was arrested in the protests.
50 people's mass limit at the Mosque at the Eid Festival and no prayer meeting in Eidgah, state the government of Karnataka
The festival of Eid-ul-Azha, or Bakrid, takes place on July 31st and August 1st.
The Karnataka government has announced that only 50 can be gathered in mosque for prayer by Eid-ul-Azha, and has banned prayer meetings at Eidgah and other places for the Corona virus epidemic.
Visitors wishing to pray in mosque must wear masks and keep distance, as ordered by AB Ibrahim, Ministry Manager for Minors and Wakf.
The decree states that the Hilal Committee decided that the Eid-ul-Azha festival, also called or Bakrid, should be held on 31 July in the province of Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Koda, and on 1 August elsewhere in the state.
It is stated in the order that while prayer sessions are one of the most important rituals of Muslims at the Bakrid festival, such events at Eidgah and other places will be banned from the COVID-19 epidemic.
Prayer, however, will be allowed in mosques, provided that no more than 50 people take part at one time.
For more than the time spent praying, the Ministry says in the directive.
Prayer meetings must not be held anywhere else, such as meeting rooms, social centres, or the “Shadi Mahal. ”
The nuclear authorities will allow temples, mosques and other petitioners to be open to those who would like to pray from 8 June, provided that the protection against COVID-19 is well protected.
The U.S. ambassador wants an armed bodyguard
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, U.S. ambassador in Iceland, believes that his life is a threat to this country and wants to carry a weapon.
At the beginning of 2020, the U.S. Embassy repeatedly advertised bodyguards in Icelandic newspapers and actually used the English word bodyguard in the advertisement.
According to Light’s sources, the fundamental reason why these jobs were advertised is that the Ambassador Jeffrey Ross Gunter claims that his life is threatened in Iceland.
A fire has been discussed with sources in Iceland and abroad that tell the ambassador that he is in great danger and that is why he is of Jewish descent.
The threat is not as obvious, but the Hoft interviewers said that the Islamic terrorists had been named as a threat.
The CBS radio station discussed the matter on its website this morning, and has reported to Washington’s sources that Gunter is out of his mind, that he needs to carry his own weapons, that he has a fenced vest, and that he has armed escorts in addition to bulletproof vehicles.
According to CBS’s sources, Gunter has been repeatedly said that there is no threat and that the advertisement for “bodyguard” is only for Gunter’s sleep.
According to Light’s sources, the situation had not been resolved at the end of June, but an application deadline expired in February.
According to medical records, this change has not resulted in formal proceedings from the U.S. Embassy.
No formal request has been made for increased guarding or for the authorization of lifeguards being armed outside the embassy walls.
The Icelandic law makes it clear that this is not permitted except by a special authorization from the U.S. Marshal.
There are no data available on any kind of threat from the Initiators of the System of Control.
The recent estimates by the U.S. Marshal are quite decisive about terrorist threats.
There are no examples of terrorism in Iceland and no indications that terrorist or extreme groups are working here.
The basis for the authorisation of the life - care provider of a foreign embassy on the streets of Iceland’s cities and cities is not available, according to the authorities of the Federation.
Gunter, who was a member of the U.S. President's High Representative, brought considerable attention to this country and called the QUID-19 "China virus".
With the title, he had since the American and Icelandic flag.
A Seattle radio who mocked Trump's reaction to protests says that it is now necessary to get a gun after the Starbucks café below his apartment was destroyed - RT USA News
Paul Gallant has got a new perspective on a violent protest after mocking the June Donald Trump President of the United States for saying that anarchists were burning and robbing Seattle city.
The only thing that had to be done was that the embezzlement was near the partner’s home.
“I feel like I have to buy a gun, because this will clearly continue to happen,” said Gallant on Twitter on Saturday night after he saw that a corrupt wolf had “drained” the Starbucks coffeehouse on the bottom floor of his apartment house.
“That’s enough, it looks like a street party down the street from me, a lot of anger now! ”
In contrast, Trump complained last month that the mayor of Seattle was allowing violent Protestants to take over the city.
“ These liberal Democrats are brilliant, ” said the president.
“ The hypocrites are burning and robbing our cities, and they feel it is only wonderful, even death. ”
Gallant, co-director of the Danny & Gallant partner station ESPN, Seattle, replied: “Go through there for curiosity last night and didn’t see either burn, robbery or death, relax salmon."
Gallant said last night that the police had advised residents to stay away from his apartment building, where explosives might be found in the damaged Starbucks café.
He published pictures of the damage and said: “Good work, you idiots, ” and explained that he had also seen fire from a number of houses.
“ I have no idea what is going on, but the cat and I are going to find out. ”
The conversion did not pass by people who mocked Gallant before his previous opinion and answered messages such as “Just relax on salmon, ” and“ Jah, perhaps Trump was right. ”
Jason Rantz, second radio in Seattle, said, “We’re not finally going on this tour we discussed. ”
Gallant went to the joke: “Awake and saw that a lot of people were drinking ‘ salmon ’ to me, and I laughed. ”
He said that he was at his first claim as he had gone through the CHAZ self-control area of anarchist and although it wasn't as bad as it had been declared.
“ So it was burned and robbed after all, ” he said.
White Lines star Laura Haddock, 34 years old, living in an apartment search with her 28-year-old lover Tom Rhys Harriets
Laura Haddock and her boyfriend, Tom Rhys Harriets, started together on the White Lines scene, which is about sighing and lingering at Ibiza, but in a house search last week, their reaction to the party island was second and quieter, away from the pleasures of the party island.
The popular family of brothers and sisters in the Netflix family series was seen with a view of a magnificent rural farm in Oxfordshire, which is for the sale of 1.2 million pounds.
They came to the area of Range Rover, which Laura, 34, drove, wearing jeans and white shirts, and met a real estate dealer there who led them on a tour of the five - room house.
In White Lines, last fall, Laura played the role of Zoe Walker, a darker side of Ibiza as she investigates the murder of her brother, Alex, the album lady played by Tom, 28 years old.
Their relationship did not come to an end until this month, within a year of the end of the six - year marriage of Lauri and Sam Claflin, which is known from the Hunger Games movies.
Together they have the four - year - old son Pip and the two - year - old daughter Margot.
When they announced the divorce last August, Clavlin, on Instagram, wrote: “I have decided to understand legal divorce, and we understand in love, friendship, and deep respect for each other, and will continue our cooperation in raising our children.
Laura and Sam first met in 2011 in an audition, and Sam, who has also played in Peaky Blenders, described their wedding in 2013 as “no doubt any of the greatest accomplishments of my life. ”
Before Laura got her role in White Lines, she had played in the previous Inbetweeners film, and in the criminal drama The Capture from the BBC, which was shown last year, as she played the lawyer Hannah Roberts.
Tom played a role in the second Inbetweeners film and in the feature series Brittany from Sky.
Counting too soon to claim another wave here in the country
A specialist in the field of plant health protection says that it is too early to claim the second wave of the epidemic.
Three new inland infections were diagnosed in the Land Hospital’s virology department yesterday and are dozens of people sick.
Two internal infections were diagnosed on Thursday, one in a man in his 20 ’ s, but the other in a man in his 20 ’ s.
Then no infection had been detected since the beginning of the month.
Yesterday, three more internal infections were diagnosed, one of which had been on the Rey Cup soccer team in Laugardal.
Jonn K. Jonnsson, a U.S. Marshal’s Information Officer, said that fewer people had to go to the press because of the disease, which was originally thought to be the case.
Another infection is that of an individual who came to the country from abroad on July 15.
Then the rules of a so - called return option had been accepted.
Kamilla Rut Sigfusdóttir, an expert in the field of disease protection at the National Medical Agency, says that the person followed the old procedure.
His vision was negative when he arrived in the country, but then he became sick, is isolated, and six have been put into sickness.
They're all on their way to sample, but two of them are starting to show symptoms.
A third infection is then related to the older man, who was diagnosed on Thursday and who has been associated with the disease of 12.
It has been found that on the journey there a new variant of the crown virus, which has not been detected earlier in the country.
“ We don’t know exactly where this virus is coming from, but we haven’t seen it before.
He who is believed to have carried the virus to the country had been in Israel but also in other European countries."
It believes that too soon, as other European countries fear, the so - called second wave of epidemics has begun in this country.
“ While the majority are still traceable, it is not eating that it is.
But we're on our toes watching, thinking of ways to act if something like that could go on."
Megan Fox communicates about the relationship
Megan Fox says he found her twin tail in Machine Gun Kelly's rapper.
“ As soon as I met him and looked into his eyes, I knew.
I am interested in constellations, and I knew at the same time that my twin soul was involved," says 34-year-old Fox.
“ A double soul is when the soul has reached enough levels to divide it into two different bodies at the same time, ” explained Fox.
“ So we are two half of the same soul, I think.
I told him as soon as we met.
I found it right away."
“ When we had known him for two days, I asked him to meet me for lunch, and I taught him about the constellations and asked him into his life.
I decided to go to the depths immediately."
Machine Gun Kelly takes on the same line as they did when they first met a movie.
“ I was hanging outside her trailer and was hoping to see her.
She has the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen."
Only two months ago Fox left his husband to ten years old, Brian Austin Green.
They have three sons together.
Kanye apologizes to Kim
U.S. musician Kim Kardashian West has apologized for his wife’s questions, which he made public about the family’s personal affairs.
“ I’d like to apologize to my wife Kim for having discussed private matters publicly, ” he wrote in an entry on Twitter last night.
A great deal of misgivings has been about their relationship, but Kanye has recently gone a lot on social media, and at a mass meeting he held last Monday, he discussed the birth of his daughter, North West, among other things, and said he almost killed her.
Then Kim appeared on Wednesday and published messages to her followers on Instagram, where she discussed her husband’s illness, which is diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Kardashian West has not previously expressed himself publicly about her husband’s illness, saying that this is because of their children and the rights of Kanye to privacy when he comes to his health.

Increased weight in counter-discrimination protests in the United States
In the United States, conventioners have gone through the streets of many cities to draw attention to racial discrimination.
Conventions have lasted two months in Portland, Oregon, since May 25, when George Floyd died in a police force in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Trump government has sent federal police to Portland, and this continues to fuel the protest.
The objectors are now also objecting to the situation of the federal police in the city.
In Seattle on Saturday, the police used flash bombs and tear gas and arrested 45 people after protesting in support of the Portuguese protests.
According to the police, over 20 policemen were injured.
One died on Saturday night in Austin, Texas, when a gun was fired into a Black Lives Matter march.
According to news reports, the man may have walked up to an armed rifle before being shot.
“The point is, it’s terrible that someone should die in protest,” said Steve Adler, mayor of Austin, in a statement.
Adler claimed to be “hard and speechless. ”
In Lousville, Kentucky, a group of protestors demanded justice in Breonna Taylor, a black woman who died in Louisville when the police broke into her home, with permission to enter without knocking, and shot her.
Taylor’s boyfriend had first shot the police because he thought they were burglars.
One police officer has been fired for Taylor's death, but the other police officers have not been brought to justice.
The NFAC, armed group of black rebels who have participated in the protest, calls for more transparency in the investigation of Taylor’s murder investigation.
According to police information, three NFAC members were injured on Saturday when gunfires were accidentally fired by the rebel army.
Possible Group Onset Infections
Five have been diagnosed with Covid-19 infection this week outside of border screening.
Two of them were diagnosed with a previously unidentified virus variant and apparently the origin of the three out of five infections is completely unclear.
It is uncertain whether the individuals have been infected with Turists who have left the country or the asymptomatic Icelander who has probably infected much more.
According to a local pathologist, a potential population infection may be associated with one of the infections.
Two were diagnosed with Covid-19 on the land last Thursday, with either type of virus.
The origin of the disease is still unclear.
Three were then diagnosed with the virus yesterday; one of them has been infected by one of them who was diagnosed on Thursday; the other came to the country on July 15th, and probably was infected outside, but the third is also infected with a vague source.
After a sequencing analysis of the Icelandic genetic analysis, the two subjects diagnosed with the virus and associated with its new variant have not been identified previously in the country.
Kamilla Josephsdóttir, a pathologist at the National Physician and a local pathologist, says that Icelandic genetic analysis is now beginning to review where this type of virus is most likely to occur.
“ The second case was similar to the one in Switzerland, but not exactly the same.
They're going to look at this and try to map it better and lead bodies to what part of the disease comes from," she says.
“ It seems, however, to be here on the side of the Atlantic Ocean. ”
Thus, the infection is unrelated to the two who arrived at the beginning of July and were traced to the United States.
Do you assume that this new species has come from outside rather than from an inland jump?
“ Yes, it’s different from what has been found here before that there’s really no chance that it was something to paint here,” Kamilla answers.
“ These individuals are all likely to have somehow come to the fore with a person who has just arrived somewhere outside, without knowing it himself. ”
Asking her, she says that at present there is no indication of the origin of this new virus.
“ It may naturally be a traveler who has left the country again, but it may also be someone who has no symptoms and who does not realize that he has been infected, and then it may naturally cause more infections.
We'll be on the toes the next few days to watch."
“ Even now, nothing has come into existence that is a smart group infection.
However, there are people who went into a disease associated with one of the infections yesterday, who have symptoms and have completed a demonstration," Kamilla continues.
“ We don’t have any results yet.
So it could possibly be a group infection during sailing."
Do you assume that there is now some kind of social abuse?
“ That’s not impossible.
It has not been recently, but it is not impossible, because we do not know who has applied this infection to these individuals, who were diagnosed on Tuesday and yesterday."
Could it be said that we are now starting a new wave of virus?
“ No, not yet.
Of course, though, we need to be very alert, and we need to keep it in mind, even though there are such limitations on how much of our vision can be taken from people.
We don't take samples from asymptomatic people but since we're getting infections that seem to be incorruptible, we need to be given a little looser hands by taking samples from people with symptoms," she says.
Thus, it is expected that the National Hospital’s pathology and virology department will enter the sample during the next days to try to map the status in this country better.
Does the country hospital have the ability to increase domestic sampling and to provide screening at the border?
“ Not unlimited, no.
Therefore, there is a need to be some basis for taking samples from individuals who are not in the screening tasks; they need to be on sick leave and show symptoms or have had symptoms and suspect that someone who has just arrived in the country or something like that," says Kamilla.
It states that there is still an outbreak of the infections that were diagnosed yesterday and that now much work is being done to obtain information about the individual’s travels.
It says that the origin of the internal infection appears impracticable, but does not rule out the possibility for any of those who have now been infected to present evidence that will eventually lead to the contamination of the original infection.
The restaurant that most people know about, but it's one of the best.
Not everyone knows where the restaurant The Rescue Rock is located and, of course, it's more foreign fans than it is in this country if they say about TripAdvisor and other pages.
A person who has flown back to the country has been heard to visit him with no surprise.
Berglind Hjärsdóttir, Dining Bloger and cooker writer, came to Saverstein on the days, and held water with enthusiasm.
“ I don’t know where to start, ” says a wonderful place.

“ Every precious thing engulfed before us, the owner of the Saverstein, in front of us, every other animal.
My wife and I sat together with our girls for an evening to clean up, so that must tell us how good the food was," Berglind adds.
“ The house in which the restaurant is thrown is an old apartment house that was moved whole to Grundarfjord.
Current owners drove their eyes to this house for sale at Akranesi, found a beautiful sea trail at Grundarfärdet, and made the dream come true.
You can read more about the house's history on the home page of Saverstein."
“ Thrusts and all siege of the stone of salvation are unique.
A few things have been gathered from the entire family, and they certainly put their problems on the housetop.
On the upper floor is a sitting room and really cosy and homely to enter this wonderful restaurant.
The quality and food business then does not hide, and it is clear that there is much involved in the success of magic and beautiful restaurants," Berglind says.

“For me and all the former and present members of Fleetwood Mac, losing Peter Green is a great time of memory,” said Fleetwood in a conversation with PA.
“ Peter was the man who founded the band Fleetwood Mac with me, John McVie, and Jeremy Spencer.
No one has ever joined Fleetwood Mac without having deep respect for Peter Green and his abilities, and the fact that the music should shine brightly and be moved by unshakable passion."
“Peter, I will miss you, but be sure your music will live,” added the 73 - year - old rock star.
“ I thank you for asking if I wanted to be your drummer all these years ago.
We did well, running a proper music career that so many have enjoyed.

Prince Joakim's line is said to be stable
Joakim Danaprins, the younger son of Michelle Thorhild of Queen Danad and Henry the late Danafrins, are still in hospital in Toulouse, France, where he had surgery last day because of a blood clot in his brain.
The Danish government broadcast, DR, quotes the spokesman of the Danish court that it is uncertain how long the 51 - year - old prince will be in the hospital, but his feelings are stable.
A DR report says that the effect of the blood clot on the prince’s health is now being investigated.
It is noted that Peter Qvortrup Geisling, a health care professional for DR, often does not occur within 24 hours of surgery.
“ It can range from minor symptoms to hemisphere, memory problems, or problems with expression,” says Geisling.
He says that the prince could ask for a long recovery period of months.
Joakim Danaprins, full name Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian, also Count of Monpezat, stayed in the family vineyard, Château de Cayx in South France when he got sick on Friday night.
He was first transferred to a hospital in Cahors, a few miles away from the farm, and then moved to the University Hospital in Toulouse, where he underwent surgery for blood clots in his brain.
Google Pixel 4 can form the galaxy
A dual Optian indent enables the extra lens of Pixel 4 to be seen in three dimensions and thereby to return a better modulus in the background with facial image configuration than in previous Pixel phones, who trusted the alpha on software to obtain this called "bokeh" effect.
To demonstrate the quality of the camera, Google mythical photographer Annie Leibovitz was given to talk about his experience with photography with Pixel 4 in the past 12 months.
Automotive study is still in the forefront of all aspects of a new Google smartphone, and in this phone “computer-controlled photography” is new to improve the HDR+ setting by combining up to nine different images.
New dual lighting controls offer different light level and shade loops and allow users to preview HDR+ at real time.
The phone is also angry at machine study to offer a better automatic white - skinning and improve the Night Night Night Night Night Night setting, which is so sensitive that it can catch the Milky Way in the night sky.
In addition to other camera lenses, Pixel 4 Soli presents “Rads Spectrums” on the front of the phone that detects Motion Sense motion so that users can drop tunes, turn off time points, turn on the alarm clock, or turn off the phone's sound by waving hands.
All Motion Sense calculations are performed on the device rather than connected to the Internet, and the same is true for a Google helper improved, where the technologyist now emphasizes the need to shorten response time and improve user privacy.
Google’s continued emphasis on using its machine study capabilities to the full has also led to a new voice recording app that rewrites live audio without sending data on the Internet.
The app is currently available only in English, but more languages are expected.
Pixel 4 will also be the first telephone to support Google Stadia, a stage in the cloud that will be launched from 19 November in the United States, but it will yet report a date for Australia.
In addition to a new Pixel phone, Google also introduced a new Pixelbook Go Chromebook computer and another generation of Google Pixel Buds hearing machines.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 The smart hearing tools, which are expected next year, are completely wireless and have a sound adjustment that listens to the environment and adjusts the sound constantly to the point where the clarity is at its highest.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 The smart hearing tools are completely wireless and set the volume according to the noise around you.
Google also reported on an update of her Nest WiFi-based Wi-Fi account with a special bone along with a number of combined base positions to improve wireless connection within the home.
The new Wi-Fi system, which will pick up the Nest name, doubles its predecessor and adds built-in microphones and speakers to use the Google helper in each home base.
It goes for sale in Australia on November 5, and it costs $399 for the bone and one Wi-Fi point or $249 for two Wi-Fi points.
Google Home Mini has also been updated, but a new $79 Nest Mini boosts sound quality by double bass and has got built-in wall attachment.
All Google Talkers will receive a new call system feature for communication between devices in the home as well as the ability to call Nest Mini outside the home using the Google Home app.

In Devon, an expert “saw the throwing of a beer bottle into a seal. ”
A rod hunter threw a bottle of beer into a seal when he disturbed the fishing line, according to a charity.
Pictures taken by Hope's Nose near Torquay appear to show a man on a rock that throws a lot towards an animal.
Duncan Kenny, who took the pictures, said that the grey sail has been hunting when the poleman emptyed the bottle and threw it in the back of the animal.
Kenny called it “fearful and ruthless conduct. ”
He said he was picking up garbage at this beautiful place in Devon, last Sunday morning, along with other people in the Sailing Society’s Seal Project when he witnessed the attack.
“ The soul tried to catch the fishing line, ” he said.
“ The hunter stretched the beer, emptyed the bottle, and threw it into the harness.
“ The bottle came on the back of the seal, and he swam away. ”
“ Fortunately, ” said Ken, “a strong animal is sold ” but“ the seller was simply doing what was natural to him.
“ By throwing a glass bottle at him you are stopping him from hunting, ” he said.
The Seal Project Society said it was “not a single case” and that it had recently received “many reports of this aggressive behavior”.
The Society’s Facebook translation says that its volunteers collected 12 bags of garbage in the Hope's Nose collection on Sunday and that “many examples of antisocial behavior ” had been observed.
All seals are protected by the law on the protection of seals, and people are asked to stay away from them.

House burned, shops robbed, and inside damaged
Over sixty people have died, and another sixty are injured after an attack in the village of Masteri, Darfur, Sudan yesterday.
The attack “was the latest in a series of serious security incidents in recent weeks, where houses were burned, traded, and marketed and damaged, ” says a statement by the United Nations Humanitarian Office in the capital city of Kartum that was sent out today.
Abdalla Hamdok, prime minister of Sudan, has announced that security forces will be sent to the war effort of the province to “protect the inhabitants and the harvest. ”
Only two days ago, an unknown army in the area killed at least 20 civilians, including children, in another attack.
“The magnitude of violence in different parts of the Darfur region is to lead to an increase in traffic, to put agriculture at risk and to threaten lives and lives, ” says the United Nations.

Omas al-Bashir, who was cast off a chair as leader of Sudan, is requested by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, genocides, and crimes against mankind in Darfur.
Meanwhile, a new Sudanese government is now trying to negotiate peace with the major rebel groups.
A TV reporter thanks an audience for noticing cancer syndrome
TAMPA, Florida (AP) — A TV reporter in Florida thanks the viewer for noticing her neck and sending her e-mails that she should have him checked.
Victoria Price, a reporter at WFLA, Tampa, began this advice and became diagnosed with cancer.
Price told Twitter that she had surgery on Monday to remove her tumour, her thyroid, and several lymph nodes.
“ The doctor said it was spreading, but not too much, and we’re hoping that this will be my first and last operation,” she said.
The observer sent Price e-mails last month and said that her noodle reminded her of the nod she had.
Price, a 28 - year - old journalist, said this week that her TV station’s slogans were “8 along with you. ”
“ However, the role of an audience with MEOR changed recently, and I couldn’t be more grateful, ” said Price.
“ I will be eternally grateful to the woman who made an effort to send me an e - mail, a completely unknown woman.
She had no obligation, but she did it anyway.
Talking about being with a man in the joint."
The object of the exposed area of Jeronimo Open Space was temporarily closed after two attacks by a coyote – CBS Los Angeles
Two were bitten by coyotes near the Oso Creek Walk on Jeronimo Road in Mission Viejo on Saturday morning and the route had to be closed temporarily.
Laura Wittmer says she sees a coyote almost every morning and usually she tries to avoid them, but on Saturday morning alone came straight to her foot and bit her foot.
The path has been closed while the attacks are being investigated.
Mission Viejo appeared early, saying: “Today, two different people announced that a cognizant had bitten a human being; the animal welfare service Mission Viejo is working on the case in collaboration with the fish and animal life division, and the parts of Jeronimo Open Space have been closed; be careful and watchful when you are traveling a lot of wild animals."
Wittmer tried to hit the coyote off with a bottle of water.
She called the emergency line to get a ride to her car, but she could drive to an emergency room herself.
The coyote disappeared in the barns, but public workers hope to fire him and test him for rabies.
Wittmer will be treated for rabies as a precaution for the next two weeks.
She said that this scary incident would not keep her from the morning races, but that from now on she would choose another place.
The condition of the other person who was bitten is not clear.
The Conventions of Racial Hate come together with the Seattle Police Department
A conflict in Seattle on Sunday between the police and protesters against racial hatred ended with the arrest of many people, but public disconcerting because of the estimates of Donald Trump U.S. President Donald Trump to send a number of federal officials into the major cities.
In May, an unarmed black man, George Floyd, launched an protest against racial hatred and police violence.
The conventioners in Seattle cut wheeled cars and broke windows in trailer houses at the protests on Saturday, which resulted in police decreed disorder, emptying the streets with pepper sprays and blast bombs.
The conventioners also set fire to trailer houses in construction areas for future teenage prisons.
Police reportedly arrested 45 people, but 21 police officers would have been injured.
The demonstration was held in support of protests in neighbouring Portland, Oregon.
Portland is in the spotlight after Trump decreed a very controversial action by the FBI, in distasteful local authorities, who tell the police to use excessive force.
Conventions have been held in Austin, Texas, as well as Louisville, Kentucky, New York, Omaha, and Nebraska, Oakland, and Los Angeles, California, and Richmond, Virginia.
In Austin, the capital of the state of Texas, one was shot to death in armed conflicts in downtown town on Saturday night, according to the police.
Along with protests, Trump is increasingly struggling to re-election in November, and he has taken on a tough policy of law enforcement.
