Politicians in Wales afraid to "like fools"
There was horror among certain members of the Walisian National Assembly of a proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This has arisen because of plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs from all over the political spectrum are concerned that change of name could give rise to ridicule.
A member of the party Labour said his group was concerned because "it rhymes on Twp and Pwp".
To readers outside Wales, in Welsh, twp means silly, and pwp means shit.
One member of the party Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there is only a short verbal leap from MWP to Muppet (fools).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is expressed in the same way as the letter u.a. in Yorkshire-English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently putting together a legislative proposal to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on names that Members of Parliament will receive is of course up to Members themselves."
Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Walisian National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals in which there was broad support for calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
As regards the title of the AMs, the Commission preferred the choice of the Welsh Parliament Members (WMPs) or WMPs, but the MWP possibility was given the greatest support in a public consultation.
AMs seem to propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach agreement may prove difficult for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to put together a legislative proposal on the changes within a few weeks.
The draft reform contains other changes in the way the Assembly operates, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs are given the final vote on what to call them when the bill is debated.
Macedonians shall hold a vote on the modification of the country's name
The voters vote Sunday about whether or not their country's name should be changed to the People's Republic of North Macedonia.
The vote will be held in an attempt to resolve a decades of battle with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province, by the name of Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a requirement on the territory of Greece and has long protested against the efforts of Macedonia to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, is opposed to the vote and he says that he will reject the vote.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in names is just a price paid to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
The hours of St Martin's stay silent while the churches of Harlem fight
"The older people I've talked to said there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there's none of the parts."
He said it's understandable that the bars disappear.
"People socialize in other ways these days," he said.
"Bars no longer constitute the neighborhood's living room, where people enter on a daily basis."
In relation to churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from selling assets does not last long and that they "before or later are back where they started".
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes full of those kind of people who do not help the neighborhood's recurring havens.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy owner flats in these buildings are white," he says, "and it still blows into the development where these churches eventually close completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the owner flats will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The original methodological congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had worked nearby took over the building.
St Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of stores on 125th Street, one of the primary shopping streets in Harlem, who would not employ or promote black.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to restore the building, they ordered the bell.
The priest David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor to St Martin's, proudly called the bell game "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the bell in June called it something else: "A cultural tax" and "a irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell game in the world that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger bell game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not find a substitute for him.
What has played out in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated story about architects and entrepenents, some of which have been captured by church leaders, others by the bishopship.
In July, the congregation council, the leading body of the parish, made up of leading laymen, wrote to the bishop about the concern that the bishop "will try to push the expenses further" to the congregation council, even though the congregation council had not been involved in employing the architects and contractors sent in by the bishop.
Some members of the congregation complained of a lack of transparency from the bishop’s side.
Shark damages 13-year-olds on diving after lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old on Saturday when he dived for lobsters in California on the first day of lobster season, says officials.
The attack happened just before 7 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then along with a group paddled over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just enthusiasm to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy cried, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
"All his collarbones were torn up," said Hammel, he saw when he came to the boy.
"I cried out that everyone should come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was reported in critical condition.
It's not clear what kind of shark attack is.
The lifeguard Larry Giles said by a media briefing that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage to his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the stretch from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons and to carry out investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take on the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's takes up competition with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with rows of beauty products with special assistants in style with department stores.
As part of a great effort to consume the UK beauty market, which has a value of GBP 2.8 billion and continues to grow, while fashion and home products decline. The larger range of beauty products are tested in 11 shops around the country and launched in several stores next year if they prove to be a success.
The investment in beauty products is as supermarkets look for new products for shelves that were previously used for TV, microwaves and residential products.
Sainsbury's says that they double their selection of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which are introduced for the first time.
The existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with branded areas in style with those seen in stores like Boots.
The Supermarket also reruns the range of Boutique makeup, so the majority of products are suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly required by younger shoppers.
The first one opened in Croydon in southern London last week, and the second one opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a development towards buying small quantities of food daily from local buyers mean that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury's, has said that stores are going to look like department stores, as the supermarket chain takes up the fight with the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales sites in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales sites since they bought both chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their sales of daily products and made purchases more profitable.
Supermarket’s previous attempts to update beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint action with Boots in the early 00's, but the cooperation ended with a quarrel about how the earnings from pharmacies in the supermarkets were to be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy chain with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the chain Lloyd's Pharmacy, for 125 GBP three years ago.
According to the strategy Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding a further range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the appearance and interior design of our range with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to advise.
Our selection of brands is designed to suit all needs and the inductive environment and the practical locations mean that we are now a convincing destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "raising", after Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to GBP 11 million
Dragons' Den-star Peter Jones left his "raise", after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement to GBP 11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared with Gwyneth Paltrows Goop-brand.
This Morning host, 37, went to Instagram to announce that she's leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den-star Peter Jones furious after she withdraws from their profitable lifestyle fire at the last moment – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "raising", when the popular TV woman during a busy meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements – with a value of up to GBP 1.5 million – meant that she no longer had enough time for their home product and accessories-brand Truly.
The company had been compared with Gwyneth Paltrows Goop fire and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated assets of GBP 11 million.
Willoughby, 37, went to Instagram to announce that she left Truly while Jones flew out of the UK to one of her holiday homes.
One source said: "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project, which she would have to deal with in the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the headquarters of Marlow, which is already ready for sale."
Experts estimate that the subscription from this Morning host, which is among the UK stars with highest earnings, can cost the company several million due to large investments in products – everything from powders to candles to clothing and home products – and the potential for further delays in launching.
And it can be the end of a long friendship.
Mother of three Willoughby and master Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as Chairman of the Board in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall be the Fire Ambassador of M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host to ITV's I'm A Celebration.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business."
Hard talk, "and we fell in love"
He made fun of the criticism he would get from the news media to give a comment which "is not worthy of a president" and to be so positive to the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his parade on a news sword.
"I gave up nothing."
He noted that Kim was interested more in a meeting after Trump proclaimed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders of the UN General Assembly Saturday that North Korea does not see a "representative response" from the United States in relation to North Korea's initial action against disarmament.
He noted that instead the United States continues with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure running.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view in the speech at his election meeting.
"Norwegian's doing really well," he said.
"There was an uproar to war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his attempt to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results – end of rocket tests, help with the release of hostages and return of earthly remains from US militarymen.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
"It's so easy to behave accordingly, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this packed arena, we'd have about 200 people standing there," said Trump and pointed at the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunamis and earthquakes rock the island and kill hundreds of people
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, non-governmental organisations were told, for example, that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population stood without home, no national disaster status was declared, which is a prerequisite for calling for international emergency aid.
"In many cases, it has been clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so it is a bit challenging," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children brings together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesman for national disaster preparedness, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the relief efforts.
Because of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly suffering, the country is very badly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami refuges are built in Aceh, but they are not a common view on other coastlines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but there appears to be a tsunami missing, and this has probably affected the death count.
Even under the best conditions, it is challenging to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new site of accident.
President Widodo turned Indonesia's poor infrastructure into a central point in his election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and train routes.
But Mr Joko's administration has been plagued by a lack of funding as the election campaign takes place next year.
Mr Joko also experiences pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken on board a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were taken from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machets, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge compensates at the last moment against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League to Chelsea with a score at the 89th minute Saturday on Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a delivery from Xherdan Shaqiri a small 30 metres from Chelsea’s target while his team was behind with 1-0.
He dot to the ball with his left foot before making a high shot at the farthest pole.
The ball flew high above the field towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a bouncing Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just about getting in the position, getting hold of the ball. Players like Shaq always try to get as far forward as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come, and I made a single touch, and I didn't think so much about it, and I just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 at the half-legged, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25 minutes.
The Chelsea Angliber returned with his heel to Mateo Kovacic before setting the pace on the midway and sprinted into Liverpool's court half.
Kovacic made a quick one-two on the middle track.
He then made a long handover that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defense and finished against the farthest pole with a shot with his left foot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool is fighting Naples in the group game in the Champions League at 15 a.m. on the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in UEFA Europa Leaguge at 15 Thursday in London.
Death rates from tsunami in Indonesia rise to 832
The death rate from Indonesia’s earthquakes and tsunamis has risen to 832 reported the country’s emergency preparedness early on Sunday.
Many people were reported to be trapped in the rubble from buildings that fell down after the earthquake, measuring 7.5 on the richter scale. It hit Friday and created up to 6 meters high waves, spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The town of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with rubble from collapsed buildings.

Parliament's statue of Cromwell will be the latest memorial to be struck by discussion on "Rewriting of the History"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts that were carried out by his fanatical puritanic followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "madness" and an " attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace at Westminster would become a goal.
The image storm during the English civil wars was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for his grandfather Thomas' actions in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thornycroft's amazing image of Cromwell is a testimony to attitudes in the 19th century and part of historiography for a figure that many still think it is worthy to pay tribute.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case, by the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate image is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is absolutely certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognisable figure representing one side of the battle.
His performances as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer pig attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China according to local media reports.
The man who is only identified under his last name "Youan", was found dead with a bruised artery and entombed in blood near a pigesti on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farm prepares to give pigs injections of vaccines at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province in China.
He had allegedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The following morning the cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pig trail next door was open.
He said there was a large ore in his mouth in the pig trail.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kg pig had bit the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and wounded," said the cousin, who goes under the surname "Wu", in a quote from Guyang Evening News.
Recordings from security cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while the police collected evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan's family and authorities are reported to negotiate compensation for his death.
It belongs to the rarity, but there are previously registered cases where pigs have attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 295 kg must have a Welsh farmer against his tractor, into his wife's fear of the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba CBC News told me that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
"They're just playful.
Those nappers, they're very curious... they're not trying to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect," he said.
The remains of hurricane Rosa are expected to give heavy rain in large parts of the southwest of the United States
As predicted, hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
But Rosa will rain with floods in northern Mexico and southwestern America over the coming days.
Rosa had won at 38 m/s, a category 1 energy, at 10 Sunday (Danish time) and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north Sunday.
At the same time, it is forming a low-pressure outlet across the Pacific Ocean, moving east toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push tropical moisture north into the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm of rain in parts of Mexico Monday.
Then the tropical moisture will interact with the low - pressure drainer coming closer, creating heavy rain in the south-west of the United States in the coming days.
Locally 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storms, floating falls and possibly landslides in the desert.
The tropical moisture will create rain with up to 51 to 76 mm of rain per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There is a high probability of storms with rapidly worsening conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move into the desert on foot when tropical rain is at risk.
Powerful rain can transform canyons into flowing rivers and thunder will create powerful local winds and create dust wind.</seg>
The low-pressure outletr approaching will bring heavy rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total precipitation of more than 13 mm which may result in smaller amounts of liquid precipitation and smooth roads.
This would be the region’s first rainfall in their rainy season.
Spreaded tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Powerful rain will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
In October there may be great temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic gets cooler, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences through central United States Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
During the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the Central and Eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start on October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the north-east regions.</seg>
There can be up to 26 degrees in New York City Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long climate outlook indicates that there is a high probability of temperatures above average in the Eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million saw the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million saw Thursday's catch-up testimony from the nominees to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who has accused him of a sexual assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle continued with stations that interrupted the ordinary programs to tell about Friday's late development: an agreement composed by Senator from Arizona Jeff Fllake, who allowed the FBI to conduct a week of investigation of the prosecutors.
Ford told the Senate's judge that she's 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh in a drunk state was pissing on her and trying to take her clothes off for a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he's 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million saw Friday.
The company recorded average ratings at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no readily available ratings from other stations showing it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems measuring how many people see programs in offices.
In order to put it in perspective, it is a ratings that correspond to a game under the NFL playoffs or Oscar Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-borne hosts strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, lay at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing, which lasted all day, said Nielsen.
ABC was second place with 3,26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after consultation.
Fllake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was caught for open CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning while protestors shouted at him when he tried to take an elevator to the hearing of the judicial committee.
He was standing with his eyes turned upside down for several minutes while he was being reviled, and CNN sent live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power and so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing in the committee.
All the television stations covered live hours later when the judicial committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should proceed to a vote for the entire Senate.
But Fllake said that he would only vote in favour of the belief that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee over the next week, which the democrats who are in the under-number of the Senate had asked for.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election had an influence because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU for "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to Theresa May on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson presented her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that Britain and the European Union should collect each other's tariffs was "by far ridiculous".
Shotscraper at Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson suspected of being responsible for the death of LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect for the shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of negligence in manslaughter, said the Baton Rouge police.
Officials released the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on, the CBS daughter company WAFB reported.
After the questioning of Simpson, the police said he admitted the shooting at Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, reports the lawyer.
The lawyer in East Baton Rouge Parish issued an interim report on Friday, saying that the cause of death was a wound from a gun shot that went from the head to the neck.
Police Department says that a task force from Louisiana State Police, state police, police from Southern University and citizens in the area have assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports leader at LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police in the area for their "respect and search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
Friday morning, the basketball coach at LSU, Will Wade, said the team was "fucking" and "shocking" about Wayde's death.
"It's the kind of thing you're always afraid of," said Wade.
Volcanic spit ash over Mexico City
Ash vomited from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
The National Centre for the Prevention of Disasters warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater and 183 gas and ash were registered within 24 hours.
The center monitored the flushes and tremors over several rounds.
Social media images showed thin layers of ash on car routes in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have noticed increased volcanic activity, located 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, since an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the rigter scale, shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
The police collide with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protestors who wanted independence, encountered with the alarm police as thousands participated in rival demonstrations that marked the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on the release.
A group of masked separatists held back alarms, threw with and powder paint and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There were also fights later in the day when the police used their stickers to keep the fights down.
For hours, independence groups cried out "Nothing forgotten, nothing forgiven" and met with Unionist protesters who cried out "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries that occurred during the protests, the local press reported.
The vote remains high in the region of independence reduced one year after the vote on 1 October, which was declared illegal from Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters voted to an overwhelming degree for independence, but the vote was low and those who opposed the desolating were largely boycotted.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting during violent clashes at voting stations across the region.
Independence groups had camped night and Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped that Catalonia could gain independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy that they had the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they had a narrow yet important victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have fought to maintain momentum, and many of their best-known leaders have either moved in exile or are in detention awaiting judgment for their role in holding the vote and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, took up the protests on his phone in support of the police and said that the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"There will be greater and greater tensions," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has awaited his trial since last year, announced that he would stand up for the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"The candidate in the European elections is the best way to reject the backlog in democratic values and the subjugation we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house hit by car
Three men, 33, 34, and 39 are arrested after a car several times bumped into a house in Londonderry.
The event happened in Ballynagard Crescent Thursday around 19.30 BST.
Detective Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow against the car may have been fired at some point.
Shots from Menga win the Livingston 1-0 over the Rangers
Dolly Mengas' first goal for Livingston secured victory
The Upsurgent Livingston overcame Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his only second defeat after 18 battles as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mengas shot made the difference when Gary Holt's team stepped up side by side with Hibernia in second place.
Gerrard's team has not won in the league in this season and will meet the leading team Hearts, which they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before then, the Rangers get a visit of Rapid Vienna in the Europa League Thursday.
Livingston, in turn, expands their undefiled stripe to six battles, and chief coach Holt still hasn't had a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances of cash outlaw
Holt's team should have been in front of a long time before they scored, and their direct playing style created huge problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but delivered across the front of the target, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the target after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's cross-cutting header in front of the target.
The home team was content to let Rangers play in front of them because they knew that they could put away troubles in the event of death.
And it was in the circumstances that the important goal came.
The Rangers made a freespark, and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created the launch to Menga, who made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
At that time the Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but fought to get through the home team's defense, and goaltist Liam Kelly was virtually not challenged.
That pattern continued in the second half of the game, even though Alfredo Morelos delayed a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was averted with the feet of Rangers painter Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame in another of Livingston's death ball situations.
There were ongoing extraditions into Livingston's field, but were prevented, and two demands for the penalty park – after Halkett's tackle on the replacement Glenn Middleton and one by one by one on the ball – were rejected.
"Finemental" from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Financial effort and strong results for Livingston.
Everyone played amazingly and exceeded expectations of their upward journey.
Their playing style and troops are largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but a large part of the honor must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he entered.
There were a lot of heroes.
Commander Halkett was fantastic and led a well-organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
At times they have been really good under Gerrard, but they played below level.
Their endings lacked sharpness – only once had they exposed the home team – and it is a good wake-up for Rangers, located in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Keln
There was smile and blue sky Saturday (29 September), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
There has been disagreement over areas such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's rapprochement with the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Keln to open a new, large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police held for security reasons a crowd of 25,000 people from getting together in front of the mosque, but lots of support appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – also made themselves noticed and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German Government’s decision to accept in the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest seen as a hero of some German Turks and mocked as an autocrat of others.
Accident on the way to Deepford: Cyclist dies in a collision with car
A cyclist is dead in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred close to the crossing between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwest of town around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and there was a rescuer on the scene, but the man died on the scene.
The accident happens a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car whose driver fled from the place, on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday accident.
Metropolitan Police said police officers were working on identifying the man and informing his relatives.
Roadblocks have been set up, bus routes have been switched over and motorists are encouraged to stay out of the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured during annoyance
Six prison guards are infested during turmoil in a high - security prison, according to Prison Office.
There was turmoil in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9.30 BST Sunday, and the disturbances are still under way.
Specialized "Tornado" guards have been taken in to handle the riots involving eight inmates and taking place in one wing of the prison.
Officers were treated for minor facial lesions on the scene.
A spokesperson for Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison staff are deployed to deal with the ongoing disruptions of the HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear about the fact that those responsible are reported to the police and can end up spending longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the warden was treated in the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, alarmed officers were called to prison to deal with serious disturbances where employees were attacked with billiard bullets.
The hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with a storm flood (larger areas can benefit)
It is rare that a tropical low pressure strikes Arizona, but this is most likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the remains of hurricane Rosa move over the desert landscape of the south-west United States and creates the risk of a storm flood.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings about the storm floods for Monday and Tuesday in Western Arizona, eastern Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route across Phoenix Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only "the tropical cyclones had preserved status as a tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km from the border with Arizona."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm of rain with isolated volumes up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin will probably get 25 to 51 mm with the possibility of 102 mm locally.
For those outside the risk of the storm, Rosa's rain can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will make use of because the southwestern United States is currently experiencing drought.</seg>
According to American drought monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, the second highest category", reportsweather.com.
First hurricane Rosa is expected to hit land on the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.</seg>
Rosa still has hurricane strength Sunday morning with maximum wind power of 38 m/s and is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves north by 19 km/h.
The storm meets cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore falls in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit in Mexico with tropical force on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over parts of Mexico can become strong and give a high risk of flooding.
"A total rainfall of 76 to 152 mm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora with a possibility of up to 254 mm", reportedweather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early in the morning Tuesday as a tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The primary expected danger from Rosa or the remains of it is very strong rain in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the south-west desert area," reported the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to create life - threatening storms and floating falls in deserts as well as landslides in mountain terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man are arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teen boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 4 BST Saturday.
He was brought to the hospital where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, the police in Avon and Somerset.
Officers have called on all those who may have mobile footage of the incidents to arrive.
Trump says that Kavanaugh was subjected to the democratic party's "badness and anger"
"A vote in Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and unholy tactics of the democratic party," said Trump at a election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been subjected to "the wrath of the democratic party" throughout the process of nomination.
Kavanaugh gave testimony in front of Congress on Thursday and strongly denied and emotional accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that he committed himself sexually to her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a statement at the hearing on his charges.
The president said Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice at the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice confirming one of the most accomplished legal brains of our time, a lawyer with an amazing past in public service," he said to a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republicans attending voting venues at the mid-term elections.
"In five weeks, there is one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
You can't vote for me, but you actually vote for me," he said.
"That's why I travel around and fight for amazing candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are out on a mission to "strip and block".
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday, a person high in the Republican Party has told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis, the death count is growing
At least 384 were killed, and many of them washed away by huge waves that hit the beach when a great earthquake and a great tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, said the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu Friday, when up to six meters high waves hit the coast at foam time, sucked many in death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami arose after an earthquake that measured 7.5 on the richter scale.
"When the tsunamite crash occurred yesterday, people were still taking up activities on the beach. They didn't run right away and became victims," said Suttopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster response GDPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"Tsunami did not come alone, the towed cars, wood trunks, houses, hit everything on land," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea with 800 km/h before the hit coast.
He said that more people were able to survive by climbing up trees to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The disaster response has published aerial photographs showing many damaged buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Destiny continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The range of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Use Board (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted during Friday's major earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb dropped over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and it may have made the tsunami bigger, said the board.
Nugroho described the damage as "concealing" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found pinched under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 had been injured and that 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho said the death count and the injuries could be larger along the 300 km long coastline north of Palu, the area of Donggala, closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communication "was completely paralyzed without information" from Donggala said Nugroho.
"There are over 300,000 people here," said the Red Cross in a registration and added that their employees and volunteers are heading for the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," they said.
The Board of Directors was criticized on Saturday from many fronts not to mention that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said that the waves had come within the time when the warning was issued.
In amateur recordings shared on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building who desperately shouts warnings of the tsuami that comes closer to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the uptake immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo aircraft with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, reporting authorities, but food and basic necessities are still urgently needed among the evacuated.
The airport of the city has been reopened, but only for relief work, and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centres in Palu Sunday.
The death rate after Indonesian tsunami smokes over 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have come safely to Palu city where employees seek refuge under tarpaulins set up in the courtyard at their account. They came past areas with extensive destruction on the road, said Doseba.
"They told me they so many broken houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when relief organisations began the harsh work of rescheduling, complaints arose that foreign emergency workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, financial support, supplies and employees from abroad must come in only if the area in which the accident occurred is declared national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at province level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for Indonesian red cross.
"When the government says "OK, it's a national disaster," we can open up to international assistance, but there's no status yet."
On the other night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing people stuck in the hope that their loved ones would become the miracles that brighten the gloomy tales of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandolo, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for Asian Games, who ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people who were caught at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagei, were among his students.
"As a veteran in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us how he had been sending whatsApp messages to the Palu participants, who attended the festival on the beach, in the hours after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles.
His messages, however, resulted in only one grey fly bone instead of two blues.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered," he says.
Thief takes USD 26.750 while filling the cash machine in Newport on the Live
Twenty stole the Friday morning $26.750 from a Brink's employee who was about to fill a cash machine in Newport on the Live, according to a press release by the police in Newport.
The car driver had emptied the ATM into the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran up behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag money that should have been delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on the identity of the thieves, please contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes name to Ye.
He announced Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote, "The world formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had the nickname Ye for a while and used the name as title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change takes place before his performance in Saturn Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, which canceled for "emotional reasons", said the show's creator.
The name is a abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most frequently used words in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year, when he discussed his album title with Radio Guard Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused pages, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who's changed their name.
Sean Combs has changed between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he reported to prefer the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former collaborators, JAY-Z, has also changed between small and large letters and changed whether the hyphen is included.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military power against civilians as it approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliatory action against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "never would use the military to suppress the Mexican people."
Tropper shot at a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, and killed up to 300 at a time when left-wing student movements took root in many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly state grants to students and opening more free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of education attract young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the USA should double the amount they spend on research in the field, says investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the US government have given notices of artificial intelligence. However, the USA still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced their plan last year and aims to take the lead in innovation within artificial intelligence by 2030.
"It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for the next major breakthrough within AI," said Lee.
The doubling of the budget could double the chances that the next major achievement in artificial intelligence is achieved in the United States, Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent companies in artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highly ranked American Othello player, and later he became head of Microsoft Research and director of Google's department in China.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions supported by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge, which was held by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when new competition will come, so that the next visionaries can be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants, says Lee.
"It is not China that grabs the academic leaders, it is the big companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years employed star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think PhDs in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically have offered work permits.
China's Council of State issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions in a way similar to the National Science Foundation and other state organisations’ distribution of money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a common centre of artificial intelligence to involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the Foundation of Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF currently invests over USD 100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
However, American legislation, which seeks to set up a national safety commission for artificial intelligence, has been still for several months.
Macedonians shall hold a vote on the modification of the country's name
The Macedonian people voted Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to the 'North Macedonia Republic', an initiative that would solve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's attempt to achieve membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province named Macedonia and maintains that the name of its neighbouring country to the north constitutes a requirement on Greek territory and has therefore used their veto once Macedonia has sought entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments made an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the primary Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Ivanov has said that he will not take part in the vote and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the electoral volume will represent the 50 % required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot was, "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price worth paying to create access to associations such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that arose as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means more secure life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of this House have said that they will respect the result of the vote and apply it.
The change of name would require a majority in Parliament of two thirds.
The State Election Commission said there were no irregularities reported at 13 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a elector in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko took part in the vote in Macedonia on an amendment to the country's name, which would open up for membership of NATO and the EU, in Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and pulled chairs up in front of tents set up by those who want to boycott the vote.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we will achieve membership with raised forehead, not by the back door," said Kavavarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would give a heavily needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that a large majority will vote in favour, because over 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after giving their vote.
He said that a 'yes' result would be a 'security of our future'.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the vote – less than the required turnout.
Another poll, carried out by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV, indicated that 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the vote to be valid, the turnout must be at least 50 % plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the Provincial Government since it took place in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero is struggling through the whole Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton defense in Manchester City 2-0 Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his scoring coming after 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a extradition on the midway at the beginning of the sequence.
He soon ran past three Brighton defenders before he went out on the open.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He fought past one defender, and then ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a handover to the left and found Sterling.
The English predecessor used his first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to list the Brighton painter Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero fights with some problems with his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola reports.
"We talked about him playing about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the immediate head start of the Premier League match.
That goal came after 29 minutes.
Aguero received in the sequence of the ball deep inside the territory of Brighton.
He sent a great delivery along his left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of contacts before he led Sterling towards the farthest pole.
The Sky Blues Award was playing the ball in the net just before it slipped past the finish line.
City is fighting Hoffenheim in the group game in the Champions League at 12:55 p.m. Tuesday on Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to mess Rockies
Nationals are eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to consume the throwe Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still room for participation in the playoffs for Rockies which have played a game more than Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
At least The Rockies were stuck in a wild-card space with a 5-2-seller over the National Friday night, but still have their first division title for good.
"Even if we have nothing to play for, we can go to the game knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audience here in Denver, and that the opponents would play at the probably highest level I will stand before this year.
Why shouldn't I be excited to play under those conditions?"
Nationals have not yet signed up for Sunday, but are likely to put Scherzer in such a situation as a pitcher.
Scherzer, who wanted to be the first man on the stain for the 34th time, trained his throw Tuesday and wanted to pitch on Sunday, which is usually his rest day.
The right-hander from Washington is located on 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings in this season.
Trump holds a election meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation around his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republicans attending voting stations at the mid-term elections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
It's one of the big, big ones – you can't vote for me, but you're actually voting for me. That's why I'm traveling around and fighting for amazing candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats you can see that this is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power with all available means. You can see how vicious, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they're hurting, who they're going to run over in order to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, but we won't give them that."
The Democrats, he said, have as mission "strip and block".
"And you have seen it over the past four days," he said, and he called the Democrats "worried and mean and disgusting and lying."
He referred to the Supreme Democratic Senator of the Senate Justice Committee, Dianne Feinstein by name, which triggered the loud bow from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, wait a minute – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a spacious party.
They are intolerant of those who express their views
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't really a surprise.
I am just the latest in a number of Labour MEPs who have been told that we are not welcome – alone because we have made our point.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship approach was to criticize me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of a responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically similar problems that Jeremy disagreed with earlier leaders in.
In the call for the meeting in Nottingham East Labour on Friday it said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Member, Friday evening meetings have just been like this.
Today, unfortunately, the tone of many meetings is not that way, and the promise of "friendly, gentler" policy is far back in the past if it ever started.
It has become more and more clear that dissenting views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are weighed to the extent that the leadership of the party can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues, with whom I thought I shared political standing, began to expect me to make an u-return and adopt positions that would otherwise never have been in agreement – whether it was about national security or the European Union's internal market.
When I say my opinion in the public – and it really does not matter what I say – is following a long strip of gross messages on the social media that calls for the rejection and contradiction of the middle-searching policy and tells me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me are, as a rule, political.
I have deep respect for the professionalism and the struggle of colleagues who, every day, are overcome by sexism or racism, but still continue to fight.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour would create a tolerant culture.
But in reality it is no longer a spatial organisation, and with each motion of censure or change of choice the party becomes narrower.
I've been getting plenty of advice over the last two years that if I lay low on myself and don't be so loud, I'm gonna "no good".
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago when I went to school, I was provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, who had left our classroom in fallible condition, and I decided to create better public services for those who need it most – whether it has been a council member or a minister in the government.
I have never hidden my policy, nor during my last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the motion for a resolution on Friday, I would say that when the country rushes forward to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour's leader.
But the one message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the local voters, whether they are members of the Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no kind of threats of rejection or political fitness will keep me from acting on what I think is your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr becomes a residence
Two late scoringer may have got the final result of drawing a non-true image, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this amazing entertaining match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard and are the only undefiled team of ten.
In the end, it was as much their superior defence as their better use of chance that carried the home team home, and coach Peter Murchie had absolutely the right to be satisfied.
"Our battles have been demanding so far, and we are still undefiled, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Respect to Ayr, they took advantage of their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's shoe after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for the Scottish national team Rory Hughes, who was awarded for the fight of Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a shoe that was not followed up by a kick.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a penalty park just before the half-play. He scored and then got a solo ring, so it stood 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half of the game, and Patrick Anderson's shoeing, which was followed up by a kick from Baggot, reduced the point difference to five.
There was then a long interruption because Ruaridh Knott had a serious injury. He was carried out off the track on stretchers. When the game was resumed, Ayr expanded with a score from Stafford McDowall and a follow-up kick from Climo.
Functioning Ayr officer Blair Macherson then got a yellow card, and again Melrose took advantage of their extra man with a scoring from Bruce Colvine without following the kick after a period of intense pressure.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson could after a line-out score behind the emerging Ayr cluster.
Climo followed up with a kick within the posts and followed up with a more nearly afterwards, the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's box kick and sent the flyer Gregor Henry off to the fifth shoeing of the home track.
Still Game star looking for new careers in the restoration industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems to take the step to the restoration industry after he has assumed the directorship of an authorised restaurant.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series that he writes and is the main player in with his partner Greg Hemphil.
The duo has announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the Director of Farm Morn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but a source suggested to Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"Havet is ours": The State of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen route to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol around the fleet headquarters, which is wrapped in rains, in La Paz.
In public buildings, there is a sea blue flag.
Navy bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are painted with the motto: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It's a duty to take it back."
In the whole of Bolivia the memory of a coast which was lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century is still strong, and the same is the longing to sail again in the Pacific.
The hopes may be on their highest for decades, while Bolivia awaits a judgment from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of voting.
"Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and is, of course, waiting with a positive look at the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country and hope that the Hague Court will agree with Bolivia that Chile – after decades of discussions – is committed to negotiating to grant Bolivia sovereignty over an area with access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic President, who is facing a controversial election campaign next year, also has a lot at stake at the Day of Judgment.
"We're close to returning to the Pacific", he promised last August.
But analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court will take Bolivia’s party – and that there would be no major change if it did.
The UN Assembly, which has its seat in the Netherlands, does not have the power to dispose of Chilean territory and has directed that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice gives judgment only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have been a setback.
"The site of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership," said Zárate.
The warring rhetoric of Morales has done away with the remaining Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making of the Court was abnormally fast.
Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open up a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "find an era of 139 years of disagreement and gain benefits for both parties," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up access rights to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past."
North Korea says there won't be nuclear disarmament unless they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never take down their nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington first.
Ri spoke Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with promises given during a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments were given following the fact that the U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo appears to be facing a restart of locked nuclear diplomacy over three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a "desirable dream" that continuing sanctions and the United States' opposition to a declaration that ends the Korean war will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to declare as long as Pyongyang has not taken significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and American president Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread scepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about abolishing an arsenal that the country most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Madeshows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large headgear that you will soon be able to buy in local shops
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne lifted on the catwalk the veil of a collection of strange headwear of extra size as part of their SS19 collection.
Very unremitting hats have dominated on Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
The most impressive work from Valentino was a lavish with a feather-like wide shadow that covered the heads of the models.
There were also other extra large accessories, including watermelons with jewels and even an pineapple – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had mixed lips that reminded more of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like a diver thing with a string and a mask, and others looked like a melted waffle ice.
And if you continue the big fashion modes, you're lucky.
Stilsper predicts that the huge hats could come to shops near you.
The fighting hats arrive in the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60 centimetre wide shade, seen on all of them from Rihanna to Emily Ratakowski.
The cult mark, which is behind the most impracticable hat that was spread across the social media, has sent a new great creation down the catwalk – a beach bag that is almost as large as the model that displays it.
The orange sauna box with bastfryrs and a white leather handle was the most eye-catching in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in ordinary shops next summer. The designer has had such a great influence that it will be hard to ignore the demand for accessories in huge size."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have many fine academic results behind them, and it continues in 2018 with another unique exam results, which in addition are strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other efforts in the local environment.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can put together and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we experience that modern languages remain a popular topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it's gonna hit the head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it hits the heart."
It is an important reminder that we cannot just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can see from the latest exam results this year that languages are highest in the statistics with the most passed exams in the independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received high grade A.
The data collected by SCIS' 74 Member Schools showed that 72 percent of the students were graded A in Mandarin, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent Spanish students also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important competences that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now perceived as subject selection at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and maths) in independent schools pensa and elsewhere.
A study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills carried out in 2014 found that among the reasons why employers could not occupy vacancies, 17% had language skills to do.
That is why language skills become more and more important in preparing young people for their future careers.
In future, more job opportunities will require language skills, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career young people choose, if they have learned another language, they have a great advantage in the future with lifelike skill like this one.
The possibility of communicating directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a head start to competitors.
According to a YouGov survey with over 4,000 respondents in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multidigit percentage, 15 percent.
It is therefore important to invest in language teaching for those who are children today.
When one can speak more languages, especially languages from developing countries, children are given a better chance to find meaningful work.
In Scotland schools differ in the languages taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most important to the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose from at independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and provides them with the skills required to succeed, no matter what the future offers.
At present it cannot be denied that languages continue to be really important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and this must be reflected in the trainings.
Modern languages should in fact be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this distinction to the youth of Scotland.
I'm getting the bee le faire.
John Edward is head of Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron gets debut for Laker Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost over for fans who want to watch LeBron James play his first game for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James plays in Sunday's opening game before the season starts with Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not yet fixed how many minutes he's playing.
"It's going to be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers-reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James most likely won't play the whole game.
After the training earlier this week James was asked about his plans in relation to Lakers' scheduled six games before the start of the season.
"Where I'm in my career, I don't have to fight before the season starts to get ready," he said.
Trump election meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a stripe election meeting tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first out of five scheduled election meetings next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on the confirmation of Trump's appointed judge of the vacancy seat of the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump tries to create support for the upcoming mid-term elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control over Congress when the votes are cast in November.
When is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump's election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be held at midnight (dansk time) the night between Saturday 29 November and Sunday 30 November 2018.
You can watch Trump's election meeting in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely talk about this week's hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court. The hearings were tense because of charges of sexual abuse, and the expected vote in the Senate on confirmation has been suspended for a week while the FBI is investigating the charges.
But the primary objective of this string election meeting is to create momentum for the republicans facing a difficult elections in November.
People from President Trump's campaign team said that next week's five election meetings aim to "create energy among volunteers and support when Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important for his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible, now that we enter the busy campaign time," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign, which would not be quoted by name, to Reuters.
The election meeting is held at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is at the back of the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the President has to step up to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, who deals with state science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team U.S. has shown a fight and is trying to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday single duellers
After three one-sided rounds, maybe Saturday's four-man pigeons were what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but a concept that players believe in – not least at competitions like this one.
Where would they say there is momentum now?
"They brought six points, and now it's four, so we'll see a little bit as momentum," said Jordan Spieth, before he lasts four nights.
Europe, of course, has the advantage: they are 4 points ahead, and there are 12 more points to play about.
As Spieth says, however, the Americans feel that they have a bit of wind in the sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both can boast three points of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to green, setting a fine example for his teammates.
The loud shouts of jubilee became louder as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important putter, which secured victory in duel four, although he and Thomas had been two blows backwards after two duels.
His put that secured them the fight on hole 15 was met with a similar scream – the kind of scream that shows that he does not believe the American team is out of competition yet.
"You just need to find the inner strength out and focus on your own fight," said Spieth.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, no doubt the biggest story from Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but sympathetic couples have received four points in four battles and appear to be flawless.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't get a bookey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bookey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way energy seems to flow both to and from the wild audience shows that it is them that it is going to be the hardest to beat Sunday. And it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory were established by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Mostly synchronized on each of their holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process against Sergio Garcia, the morning in the four-man duels when he formed couples with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swedes in a hole they were never near to get out of.
Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The struggles with four balls and two teams a two players are so fascinating to look at close teams because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they provide, the advice they do not give, and the way the strategy lightning-fast can change.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a significant reduction before the last day, but the four-man dueels have also shown that Team United States has the battle-goat which some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe creates 10-6 ahead of the last day in Ryder Cup
Europe has a great advantage before the last day of Ryder Cup, after they came out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a passage across the United States of 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two victories over a troubled Tiger Woods and have so far received four points at the Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, trying to win the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated over an unprecise American team in the morning fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The United States gave more resistance to Foursomes. They won four games but were still behind.
Jim Furyk's team will need eight points on Sunday's 12 single games if they're going to keep the bag.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant who has won four points in a row, and he and Molinari who together have got the nickname "Molliwood" is after a sensational weekend the only other pair in Ryder Cup's history who have won four points in their first four games.
They crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in Fourballs and then elegantly defeated a mature Woods and the American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought through the first two games on Saturday, had small brilliant glimpses, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 games in Fourballs and Foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well rested for the morning Fourballs and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in Foursomes and got a 2-1-sail over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – which is number three in the world.
Europe does, however, have it completely, as they want it to, on a light blowing day southwest of Paris.
Three major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans by two points Saturday.
They had a hard fought 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in Fourballs and later returned and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in Foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the Ryder Cup story that a team has fought back after being backwards with four points before the single games. However, since Furys currently has the bag, they only have to achieve a tie to keep it.
However, having been second best for two days, they seem to be unable to master a counterattack Sunday.
North Korea says they won't break down unilaterally if there's no trust
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the Saturday UN that continued sanctions amplified their mistrust to the United States and that it will not abandon their nuclear weapons unilaterally under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the World Organisation that North Korea had shown "excellent goodwill" in the last year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, settling an area for nuclear tests, and promising not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We have not, however, seen a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security and under such conditions there is no chance that we will take the first steps ourselves and take unilaterally."
Whide Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "fascised" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps. But his speech seemed important as it did not clearly reject unilateral disarmament, as it has previously been the case from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint announcement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work "atomnasal equipment on the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has asked for a formal end to the Korean war, which took place in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown resistance to softening the high level of international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament first' and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve their aims by force and even opposes the 'declaration of the end of war'," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us to the knees is a wishful dream among peoples who do not know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions reinforce our distrust."
Rí did not mention plans for a more summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in within the last five months and added: "If nuclear disarmament were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so locked."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ris' speech was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that firing North Korea's rockets against the mainland of the United States was inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim a "rocked man" on suicide mission.
Last year Trump threatened the United Nations with the "total destruction" of North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for courage in terms of disarmament, but said that there is still much to be done and that sanctions have to remain until North Korea comes down.
Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a timetable for these actions, but said "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
However, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council must maintain sanctions with conviction and without error until we obtain the total, final, confirmed nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he was going to visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, whereas North Korea only a few hours after accused him of making "extremely demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close off a missile facility as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "current steps."
He said that Kim had told him that the "current steps" he demanded were the security promises that Trump gave in Singapore, as well as movements towards a normalization of the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard take a course on getting enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all bachelor students more sleep. The aim of the course is to counteract the growing macho culture where students study all night held up by large amounts of caffeine.
One researcher has shown that students at the best university in the world often have no idea the first thing to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has completed the course which, he believes, is the first of his kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the course after giving a presentation of the effects of sleep deficiency on learning.
"When the paper was finished, a girl came up to me and said, "Why do I only get this information now that I'm on the candidate?"
"She said that no one had ever told her the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is offered for the first time this year, explains the students how good sleeping habits can improve one's academic and sporting performance as well as one's overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University's Health Area, says that the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in serious sleep loss during the week.
The timelong course consists of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises there is a picture of a dormitory room where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how one's sporting performance is affected by lack of sleep and how important sleep habits are.
In another part of the course, participants will hear about how sleep shortages over a long time increase the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to reflect on their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map of campus.
"We know that it will not change the students' behavior immediately.
But we think they have the right to know - just as one has the right to know how cigarettes affect health", adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride of taking a "allnighter" still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students have led to lack of sleep as a growing problem.
The "secret weapon" against stress, exhaustion and anxiety is good and adequate sleep, he said – it even counteracts weight gain because sleep shortage makes your brain think that you are hungry, why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California who studies chemical and physical biology, last year helped Professor Czeisler organise the course when he took one of his courses on his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and made him work to make it a general course at the whole university.
He hopes that the next one will be that all graduates will be offered a similar course before they continue their training.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to put an alarm so they know when to go to bed and when to get up. This can create awareness of the harmful effects of the light from electronic monitors, which can move at the rhythm of the day and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Targets from Menga lowers Gerrard and co.
The Rangers suffered another defeat on the outfield when Dolly Mengas's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's independent team had to thank for a defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was looking for their first victory on the field since the 4-1-triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard the only second defeat in 18 games as a coach. Thus, there are eight points up to Hearts at first place by Ladbroke's Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Ranger team could not answer.
The Rangers are now going down to a sixth place, while Livingston crawls up to a third place after Hibernia with only the target score difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to Rangers, as line judge Calum Spence had to be treated after having been hit in the head by a cast object which seemed to come from the outfield section.
Gerrard made eight changes in the layout that reached Betfed Cup's semifinal by tons past Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, presented with the same 11, which shaved a point of Hearts' delivery last week, and he would have rejoiced to see his sharp team exhausted the opponents all over the course.
The Rangers had the ball most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should have scored two minutes in the game when Menga's first hand sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but the midway player's attempt passed.
A free kick in the depths from Keaghan Jacobs found his way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defender Alan Lithgow kicked past the rear pole.
The Rangers, however, took control, but played more on hope than ability in the attack game.
Alfredo Morales was not at least satisfied when Judge Steven Thomson admitted to the Colombians' appeals about the penal park when he and Steven Lawless broke up after a neighborhood game.
Rangers managed only two shots on targets in the first half, but former Rangers goalmaker Liam Kelly did not have any trouble with Lassana Coulubaly's head blow and Ovie Ejaria's tamble shot.
Although Livis’s opening in the 34th minute was a coincidence, it must be said to deserve their efforts alone.
Again, Rangers couldn't handle a death ball situation in the depths of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took the time to find Menga, who could easily kick it in.
In the pause, Gerrard Coulibaly replaced Ryan Kent, which almost immediately gave the pot when the flyer sent the ball to Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the team to play on their premises with many long balls up the track from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have expanded the lead in the final part of the match, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with a secure hand before Lithgow headed next to goals.
Rangers' break-in Glenn Middleton again appealed for a late penalty park after being dried up with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked here the other way.
Yearbook: Inventor of the geiger counter
And now a page from the yearbook "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago – if TELLER ... – was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that would eventually lead to the apparatus known as the geiger counter.
The geiger counter has become a permanent part of both science and popular culture, as could be seen in the 1950 'Bells of Coronado' film, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played the leading role as peasant scientists:
Man, "What on earth is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals does."
Evans, "Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
"His" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before he would have turned 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells during treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then "see" the protein that is common to many cancer types and where they are injected again.
A test vaccine is effective in patients with a range of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from patients and modifying them into the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein called HER2, which many cancers have, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "makes several cancers develop", including breast, ovarian, and intestinal cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, taking immune cells out of patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a particular type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL performance.
It didn't go well.
After an independent performance in the Saturday Night Live study, Kanye West beat off when he praised the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and said that he himself would run as President's candidate in 2020.
After playing the third song of the evening Ghost Town wearing a Make America Great Again chest, he began at a thunder talk against the Democrats and held his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people so often, saying, 'Why do you like Trump, he's racist?'
But if I was worried about racism, I would have long since moved from the United States," he said.
SNL started tonight's show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Legal Affairs Committee about Christine Blasey Ford's assault charges.
Although the footage wasn't shown, comedian Chris Rock West's got a lot of money on the social media.
It's uncertain if Rock tried to show West by putting up the footage.
West also complained to the audience about poor treatment backstage because of his head covering.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hat on.'
They bullied me!
And they said I was sung deep," he said according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you see how deep I am sunk?" and said that he would put on his Superman coat, because it means that "You can't decide what to do. Do you want progress in the world?
Try love."
The audience béhede at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff seemed to be embarrassingly affected, says Variety with a comment from a person who was present: "There was a bomblag in the studio."
West had been booked as replacement for singer Ariana Grande, if that was the girlfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West confused many by performing with the song I Love It while he was dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West got the support of the leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: TAK NOT TO LEARN YOU KUE OF PØBEN."
Talkshow was Karen Hunter tweeted that West just "is what he is, and that's fine."
"But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothing or supporting his "art"), who embraces and pours an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's on it.
And so have we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced that he has changed his name to "the unit which is officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and thus follows Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The Rapcler Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion, and the newly deceased music-playing Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formulaly Know as Prince.
Indicating for attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man on Friday was stabbed with a knife at a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, says the police.
The defendant is expected to be brought before the District Court of Belfast on Monday.
The statements are reviewed by the public prosecutor.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington longs for toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known to swing swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor is looking for the stereotypical macho hero and saying that this kind of TV character means that young men often feel that they must be hard to be respected.
Kit said to the Sunday Times Culture that he believes that something has gone "missing" and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo Age.
Kit, who recently married his Star of Thrones Game Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem lies with him "very much in mind".
"For now I am very concerned – where have we gone wrong in town with masculinity?" he said.
"If we look at the current problems, what is it that we have learned young men in their upbringing?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the very masculine nature.
He continued: "What are innate, and what are you given?
What are the young men learning from television and on the streets who make them feel like men like this?
I think this is one of the great questions of our time – how do we change it?
For it is obvious that something has gone wrong for the young men."
During the interview he also admitted that he will not make successors to the Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and said that he is "completed with battlefields and horses".
Kit contributes from November to a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film director and his brother who is the thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers it to have met his wife Rose to be the best part of the entire Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever," he said.
Rose played Ygrite, as Kit's character, Jon Snow, fall in love with the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie's family land property in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has published a 14% increase in the number of people with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, says the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China because of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who receive HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, says Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
In a year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China's LGBT environment.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalized, but discrimination against LGBT people is reported to be a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry sooner or later women because of the country's conservative values.
Many cases of infection are due to a lack of prevention in these circumstances.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff leaked data about Republican Senators and torture against "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Member of the House of Representatives Maxine Waters denied Saturday's allegations that a member of her staff has shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles democrat claimed that the allegations originated from websites and supported from "the extreme right".
"Lows, lies, and more horrible lies," wrote Waters in a Twitter look.
The published information reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill. It happened during a hearing in the Senate concerning trafficking charges for sexual abuse against the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support pages such as Gateway Pundit of RedState announced that the IP addresses indicated that the information had been posted by Waters' people, after which they published information about a member of Waters staff, writes The Hill.
"This unfounded charge is completely untrue and a direct lie," continued Waters.
"Member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, is by no means responsible for this leak of information.
This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie."
Waters' registration quickly received criticism online, including from former press secretary in the White House Ari Fleischer.
"It's an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
"It indicates that she does not have the right temperament to be a congressman.
If you're accused of something you haven't done, don't get angry.
You can't be defiant.
There is no question about the prosecutor's motives.
You have to keep your peace of mind."
Mr Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' response to the critics' criticism of Kavanaugh, which was criticised for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to take over Waters' seat in the mid-term elections, also made his opinion known on Twitter.
"If that's true," he tweeted.
In Waters' official registration, she says that her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and the ordering power regarding these fraudulent claims."
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are found," she continued. "And that they will be held legally accountable for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all and everyone in my staff."
Review of Johnny English strike again – entertaining spy comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all newer films with a British lingerie, and it also seems relevant for the latest action comedy in Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will dry, sarcastic self-satire, about how much it is with us, become the country's new export option?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his rubber face and the big eyes have got his permission to make roars over again. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comic finding aimed at places where the cinema visitors do not speak English.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent, who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a little Clouseau, a knife-stick Mr. Bean and a proper claw of him who performed a single tone to the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of the Olympics in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the worldwide and international lukewarm pants that left chaos in their wake after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television commercials.
There are some good moments in this recent shot at the tribe of JE.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the propellers turned against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical cometics, but the humor feels quite entertaining and strangely unnecessary, especially now that more "sirious" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible also offer convincing cometics as an ingredient.
The Humor seems to be directed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy adventure isn't as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film pholleries in the role as Mr. Bean.
The infinitely current starting point for the film is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An internet hacker has infiltrated England's tophable spy network and revealed the identities of all the English agents in the field to the horror of the responsible agent – a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last chance for a poppy and battle-ready Prime Minister who already suffers a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the manuscript.
When her security advisers inform her that every active spy has been exposed, she has to cancel someone's pension.
And it is of course the smart Johnny English, who is now headmaster at a high school, but who in hiding teaches how to become a secret agent. There are some funny sequences here when English stands for a kind of school of Rock training in espionage.
English hastens back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunites with his hard tried previous right hand Bough, which is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now been married to an overenthusiast but well-meaning submarine lady – a role played by Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the general presence of the Royal Intelligence Service is behind Batman and Robin when they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful five-me fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is stumbled to let himself be immigrated by the charismatic and unimaginable tech-milliard Jason Volta – played by Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England's computer problems.
English and Bough start their furiously risky escapades: disguised as servants they set fire to a distinguished French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English creates clean fulok as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to get acquainted with Volta's house.
All the cannons are fired off in the film's closing sequence, but however well-meaning and energetic it is, there is a sense of child television over it.
Pretty mediocre.
And as I couldn't help thinking about with the other Johnny English film: Can't the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that gives his talent justice?
Labour refuses to shave with plans for four-day working week with unchanged wages for the British
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour is said to consider a radical plan, so that the English can settle for a four-day work week, but get paid for five.
The party will allegedly have business leaders use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give employees an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would have three days' weekend without losing their salary.
Sources say that the idea would be consistent with the party's economic objective of drawing the country in a more favourable direction for the workers.
Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day week of work as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party said to The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published before the end of the year."
"This will not happen on a day, but a four-day week of work is a goal that suits the party's approach to changing the economy to the benefit of the workers and to the party's overall strategy for industry."
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea when the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the election campaign for the Parliamentary elections in 2017.
However, the objective is not supported unanimously by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day week of work is not the party's policy and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour's shadow finance minister John McDonnell spent last week's party meeting listing his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell says he's determined to pull the power back from "anonyme directors" and "exploits" in utilities.
The Minister of Shadow Finance's plans also cast doubt on whether current shareholders of water supply companies will get their money back, as a government with Labour at the head could 'recalculate' them on the basis of immoral acts.
He also confirmed plans to have employees on corporate boards and to set up including ownership funds, which will assign 10 per cent of the private companies’ equity value to employees who are able to receive up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their voice
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week, and it raises the question of whether the FBI's findings could lead the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that was shown on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig something out that could make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"When I went in to the hearing, I said I had spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was steel-set, determined and unambiguous."
Graham's voice, on the other hand, seems to be stoned.
"I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and other things would require a very violent accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know Brett denied it strongly," Graham added with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the ones she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see it having to change anything."
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has it done to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York host city for the Global Citizens Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive range of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end the world's poverty.
The World Citizen Festival will be receiving tens of thousands of people for the seventh time on Central Park's large lawn, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will draw attention to the real goal of ending extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international organisation of interest that fights to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
To receive a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must perform a number of tasks or "actions". For example, do voluntary work, write to a world leader, make a phone call or another meaningful act that can draw attention to the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been, now that they have 12 years left to reach the goal?
Creates the idea of rewarding people with a free concert real change, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" – that people feel that they make a difference by signing a signature collection online or making a Twitter look?
Global Citizen reports that since 2011 they have registered more than 19 million "actions" from their members aimed at different goals.
They believe that these actions have encouraged world leaders to set binding objectives and policies, corresponding to over USD 37 billion, which are expected to have affected more than $2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 objectives and actions that had been achieved because of their actions, which ran up to over $10 billion already paid or collected.
The Group estimates that these funds have so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people all over the world.
One of the main objectives is The Power of Nutrition, which has started in England and is a collaboration between investors and strong people. They strive to "help children to live out their full potential" and promise $335 million to address nutrition problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the English Government, donors, other countries' governments and world citizens like you, social injustice with malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books," said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the UK government has now promised funds to improve the nutrition of mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 calls online. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with nutrition advice.
In response to one of the website's frequently asked questions that says: "What makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen wrote: "It will be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we will stumble and make mistakes.
But as with the civil rights movement and the movements against apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monée are among the performers at this year's New York festival.
The United States can use its fleet to "bloker" for Russian energy exports, says the US Minister for Home Affairs.
"If necessary" Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, even in the Middle East, exposes the US Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, to Washington Examines.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially where they operate on invitation from the right government – is a pretext for extending their energy sales.
"I believe they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"The US has with our fleet the opportunity to ensure that there is free passage on the sea roads, and if necessary we can also block them so that their energy does not come to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting held by Consumer Energy Alliance – a nonprofit organisation that views itself as "the voice of American energy consumption" – held.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran and said that they were essentially the same.
"The economic potential of Iran and Russia is about using and replacing fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as a one-trick pony, whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come after the Trump administration has been aiming to increase European exports of liquid natural gas to replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
In order to achieve this, spokespersons of Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 management project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin the Moscow "captive".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion expensive Nord Stream 2 line, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is only an economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of unfair competition and simply due to economic considerations.
"I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose the supplier," said the Russian energy minister, Aleksandr Novak, at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with the American energy minister, Rick Perry, in September.
The position of the Americans is met by criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to interfere outside the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a major problem with a third party interfering in our energy supplies," said the leader of BDI, Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" to stand up for the presidential elections in 2020, says the Senator of Massachusetts.
Senator of the Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren "considers to be serious" to present the presidential elections after the mid-term election, she said Saturday.
At a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering getting up.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and that takes a woman in front," she said, in The Hill.
"After November 6th, I would like to think strongly about standing up for the presidential elections."
Warren made his opinion on President Donald Trump known during the City Council and said that he "guided the country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been pronounced in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Courtnominated Brett Kavanaugh.
On a tweet Friday Warren wrote, "Of course, the FBI has to investigate the case before the vote."
However, Thursday's poll shows that most of Warren's own backland doesn't think she should run by 2020.
According to a poll by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "true" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not set up.
32% supported the possible candidate.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick with 38% for and 48% for a possible layout.
Other high profile democratic candidates discussed during the presidential elections in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont's Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden states that he will announce his final decision in January, writes Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palins PTSD at a election meeting for Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through after he's come home makes me able to relate to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers are returning to home," she told the audience to a Trump Whale Meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in space" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and become harder, thinking whether there is respect for it, their colleagues on land and in the air and all the other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was accused of domestic violence against a woman in order to prevent the notification of domestic violence and to possess a weapon intoxicated state, says Dan Bennet, a spokesperson for the police in Wasillas.
18 States and D.C. support opposition to new asylum law
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new US law which refuses asylum to victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. delivered on Friday in Washington a party-independent statement in support of an asylum seeker who opposes the law, says NBC News.
The applicant's full name in Grace vs. Sessions, which American Civil Liberties Union submitted in August against the federal law, has not been published.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons, who are gang members", had abused her, but American officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
State prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of American asylum seekers originate, as countries with far-reaching problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum legislation rejected a decision by the U.S. Foreigner’s Board in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia's State Attorney General, Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new law "refers to the state, federal and international laws of decades."
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be determined on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle goes against that principle," states the Party-Independent Declaration.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law of rejecting immigrants harms the American economy, as it is more likely that they will become self-employed and "provide the necessary labour."
In June, Minister of Justice, Jeff Session's immigration judges deprived them of the right to grant asylum to victims who flee from domestic violence and bandevold.
"Asyl is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political standing," said Sessions in its decree of the Law of 11 June.
Asylum has never been meant to remedy all the problems – or just all the serious problems – that people all over the world face every day.
While the death rate is doubled, attempts to find survivors in Palu are desperate
Survivors only got worse.
"It's very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her little fever-headed boy at an evacuation center in the ruined town of Palu.
"Every minute, the ambulance comes in with a body.
We need clean water."
The inhabitants now returned to their ruined homes to sort out the soaked possessions and save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, which were also affected by the 7.5 earthquake, could not follow along.
Some of the injuries, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were outside the Palus military hospital, where patients are treated outdoors due to severe afterlife.
He got tears in his eyes when he told me how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I grew up against a ruined wall, I think," said Haris to Associate Press and added that his family was going to a wedding in town.
"I heard my wife yelling for help, but then there remained still.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
American Ambassador accuses China of unfine methods and propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper brought a four-page ad in an American daily, which hit on the drum for the benefits of American-China cooperation, the American ambassador in China Beijing accused of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The U.S. president Donald Trump referred to China Dailys' paid entry into Des Moines Register – Iowa's best selling newspaper – after accusing China to interfere in November 6th. China rejects the accusation.
American officials state to Reuters that Trump's accusation of Chinese interference in the U.S. elections marks a new stage in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in an escalating trade war, where they have imposed customs duties on each other’s import goods for several times.
China's retaliatory duty in the trade war was supposed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, believe Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China, former Governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a leader on Sunday Des Moines Register that China "receives the use of the unfine methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government is using the proud American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by running a paid ad in Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In the Kinos here in Beijing you will find only a few disagreements, and you will not get a fair picture of the different views of the Chinese people on China's worrying economic direction, as the media are under strict control from the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, although he did not say which.
Republicans alienate women prior to the mid-term elections on the Kavanaugh case, warning analysts
While many top-republicans support and defend the supremely-nominated Brett Kavanaugh against allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that they will experience a counter-reaction in the forthcoming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The case has put the feelings in order, and most Republicans have already published that would like to see the voting process continue.
"This cannot be done about," told Grant Reher, professor of political science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article Saturday.
Reher said he doubted that the Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona)' request for an FBI investigation for 11 hours will alleviate angry voters.
"Womans don't forget what happened yesterday – they won't forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman of the progressive MoveOn group, according to The Hill on Friday.
On Friday morning the demonstrators cried out during a demonstration in the Senate: "November comes!", when the Republicans, who control the judicial committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, says Mic.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach new heights," said independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg to the news media.
"People say it has already reached a high level; that is right.
But it can reach even higher, especially among female swingers in the suburbs and younger voters – 18-29-year-olds – who rarely vote, despite not liking the president."
Even before Ford's public accusations about the sexual assault of the Supreme Court, analysts had pointed out that it could be averted if the Republicans continued the nomination.
"It has become a worse mess for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just a question of the committee's vote or the final outcome, or of Kavanaugh being held responsible; it is also about how the Republicans have dealt with it here and how they have dealt with her," points out Guy Cecil, President of Priorities USA – a group that supports Democrats in being elected – to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to have shared views on who they should believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, where the latter has a little more on their side.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents were certainly or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they were definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that they thought that Kavanaugh was either probably or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
At the request of Fllake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least another, Deborah Ramirez writes to The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate's Legal Committee last week that Kavanaugh, in full possession of her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her sex parts at a party when they both studied at Yale in the 80s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to create a new internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, launches a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The newest project of the technology legend is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the plan with Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up business.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology so people can make their own "personal online data collection" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, two-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data collection is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea of Inrupt is, according to the company managing director, John Bruce, to gather resources, processes and abilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contracts and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology developers worldwide can make their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team do not talk to "Facebook or Google about whether to change everything completely, so all their business models suddenly become unnecessary."
"We don't ask for their permission."
Berners-Lee, in a presentation on the Medium last Saturday, wrote that the Inrupts "mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new internet that is built on Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While launching the Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next period of the Internet," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Guest recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War I hails
The only priest of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross by fighting during World War I is celebrated in his home city 100 years later.
Lt. Colonel Bernard Wann won the order on September 29, 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and was never told he had won the highest English military order.
Last Saturday a memorial stone was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, North Hamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said that it was "inconceivably symbolic," that the stone was exposed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's winning work.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Vann on September 29, 1918, led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from machine gunry and artillery."
He later ran to the front line and led with the "greatest man's courage" his people forth before he alone attacked an artillery and unharmed three cannons.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann at 72 said that his grandfather's actions were "something, I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother James Vann also put a wreath after the parade, which was listed by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people emphasizes the true heroism."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead got Gurli Gris
Imagine that you've stayed up all night to see that star-skinned Bellator 206 and then won't be able to see the main event.
There were 13 battles on the program from San Jose, including six battles on the main program, and they were shown night through in England on Channel 5.
At 6:00 in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald got ready to meet each other, the viewers in England were somewhat surprised when the transmission changed to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimponated after they had stayed awake until the morning for this particular battle.
A fan on Twitter described the shift to a children's cartoon as "a sort of sick joke."
"In accordance with the law, this content was not appropriate at 6:00 in the morning, why they had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior service president when he was asked about the broadcast.
"The Grisen Gurli, yes."
The CEO of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that they will work to include English viewers in future planning.
"When we think of the re-dismission, I think we can make it work," said Coker.
"But it's six Sunday mornings over there, and we don't find a solution to that until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me when the change took place, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, and we thought it was a technical mistake.
But that was the law, actually.
I can promise you this will not happen next time.
We're just five games instead of six, like we usually do, and we're trying to give our fans a little extra, and then we're out of time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had "minority" over sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt less worth than anyone in his childhood because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that it didn't happen to him until he came into the larger classes that "everybody isn't like me."
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about homosexual rights to give others hope.
He also said that he went less into winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The common host of the long run radio program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off because of illness.
Daley was a guest in Lavenes' first program and said that he felt "less worth" than everyone else in his childhood because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "until today, the feelings of feeling worth memory and feeling different have been the things that have given me strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they learned his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze winner has become a highly profiled LGBT champion and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for the decriminalisation of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences, and he would give others hope.
The triple world champion said he had been "overrun" when he fell in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but told me that the age difference had never been a problem.
He said that it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs when you go through so much at such a young age – he went to his first OL as 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June, the couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his perspectives" had changed".
"If you had asked me last year, it would be all about whether I would win a gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 as 40 years of age after having diagnosed brain cancer.
Daley told me that his father did not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they had received tickets for London in 2012 – when he would be sitting in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't be there at that time.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and I first realized that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the Olympics in 2012 and won bronze.
"I just knew that's what I'd dreamed of all my life – that dive in front of a home audience at the Olympics. There was nothing that could beat that feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first song choice – Proud by Heather Small – which had meant a lot during the run-up to the Olympics and still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Oskarp Mickelson on the bench for Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson sets record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in Ryder Cup, but he has to do something about the shape if it isn't going to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who records for the 12th time, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's Fourballs and Foursomes.
Instead of being at the centre of events for the United States as usual, the five-fold big winner had to play cheers and practice his game in the hope of correcting the whips.
Even at the high point of his career he had the most straight drive, so the 48-year-old is not a perfect match for the course at the Le Golf National, where the long rough often punishes stray shots.
And if the track wasn't a big enough mouthful, at the ninth match on Sunday Mickelson will meet the always precise winner of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who has joined the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, starting the 12 single games, start fast, Mickelson's fight can be decisive.
Furyk did not surprisingly express faith in his teammate.
"He understood his role completely today, gave me a snap on my back, put his arm around me, and said that he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a great faith in himself."
He is in Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams before – and also this week.
I don't think he had to play two games.
I thought he'd play more, but that's how it went, and that's how it should be.
He wants to be out there like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson beats Nick Faldo's record for most played games in Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never been able to match completely with his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 victorys, 20 defeats and seven down, although Furyk said that his presence contributes with something indefinable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, white, he likes to stick to people, and he's good to have in the team room," he explained.
"I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than only the game."
Europe's Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that great delivery can quickly disappear
The European Captain Thomas Bjørn knows from experience that a solid flow before the last day of Ryder Cup's single performance can quickly become nervous.
The Dane debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a head start of five points above the Americans, but was just about to be caught before the finish line with a victory of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice lead in Valderrama, we had a nice lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we only just won exactly," says Bjørn after seeing the 2018 team win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday for a total entry of 10-6 at the Le Golf National.
History tells me and the rest of the team it's not over.
It's gonna have a lot of garbage tomorrow.
Go out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy, and that is where our focus lies.
I've always said that I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're also aware of what's on the other side – the best golfers in the world."
Enjoyed at his players performances on a tough track, Bjørn added: "I'm not taking any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow it's the individual performances that count, and it's something completely different.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it goes well, but when you're out there alone, you're tested on all parameters like golfer.
That's what players need to understand – make the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, because he also has to get the best out of himself."
It also looks like the opponent Jim Furyk, who hopes for better individual performances than in the partner game except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced conversions on the last day. First on the Brookline winning team before he lost when Europe made the "Miracle on Medinah".
"I remember every word," he said when he was asked how captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 had spoken to his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like a good start, as you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When momentum has found a direction, it puts great pressure on the middle struggles.
We put together our teams in relation to it and put players on the track in the order we feel about. We're trying to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the backlash and facing Rory McIlroy in the top battle, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it ensures us all the way through," said Bjørn about his choice of single players.
Germany's new warship is being postponed again
The German fleet's latest frigate should have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War. However, the Germans must wait at least a year yet more due to technical problems and an escalating price, writes local media.
The deployment of the largest ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigatter, "Rheinland-Palatinate", has been postponed to the first half of 2019 according to the newspaper Die Zeit, who quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have become part of the fleet in 2014, but the post-delivery problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, are intended to replace the aging frigates from the Bremen class.
They know that they want a strong cannon, a large selection of anti-air shots and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the latest frigates is a minor need for maintenance: It should be possible to have the frigates away from home ports for up to two years.
However, the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which are reported to make Germany appear as an overseas power factor – will already be obsolete when they are admitted, writes Die Zeit.
The failed F125 Fregat created headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to take the ship into use and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Not much was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of crucial "software and hardware failures" which made the warship unusable in battle situations.
Software errors were of particular importance, since ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are to be controlled by a crew of 120 sailors – it is only half the crew of the older Bremenists.
It also turned out that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and reduced the fleet's ability for future updates.
The 7000 ton of heavy "Rheinland-Palatinate" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware errors, the price of the project, which includes training the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion € (3.6 billion dollars), with an original price of 2.2 billion €.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's fleet power is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Government's Defence Committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet is "lost to the deployment of clear ships."
The official said that the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of service without being replaced.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust Sligtes for the Secret Life of Flagmuses
New research from an area in the Highlands of Scotland is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape when they hunt.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and will help in the work on future conservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scientists from Scotland's National Trust and follows ordinary bats, dwarf bats, long-drained bats and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment shall be placed in carefully selected locations in the area to take up the activities of the bats during the season.
Data are also collected from NTS staff and volunteers using handheld detectors.
In-depth analysis of the sound recordings will reveal the bat frequencies and show what kind of what does.
To produce a detailed landscape picture of their behavior, a report and a map of the habitat are made.
The NTS Rob Dewar nature conservation consultant hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help to determine the benefits of habitat conservation efforts such as the establishment of meadows and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and Britain has fallen dramatically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect shipowners and restrict their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as can fly traps, chemical treatment of building materials and infestations from pets.
Flavor mice aren't really blind.
But because they primarily hunt at night, their ears are more usable than their eyes.
They use an advanced echolocation technique to find insects and fly outside obstacles.
NTS, which is responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data inspect nests and sometimes do rescue operations.
The organization has even made Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve in the Threave area of Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten of Scotland's bats.
The district manager, David Thompson, says it is an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Three, we have a really good area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitat.
You don't know a lot about bats, so work here and elsewhere can help to understand what they need to thrive."
He stresses the importance of looking for bats before performing maintenance tasks on properties, as the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and young people, thus destroying an entire local population.
Flagermus is protected and killing, causing or disrupting them or their nests is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Project Manager for Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to give a hand.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we have, we don't know how the populations develop."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers sue German journal
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape charges against him for "fake news" and says that people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news media Der Spiegel, who brought the accusations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of having raped an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he paid her $375.000 to keep it a secret, wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
Some hours after the allegations had been published, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticised the information for being "fake news".
"No, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-fold winner of Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"They will promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They'll be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man, and everything is good," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel because of the charges they have called "an unforgivable publication of suspicions of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player would seek compensation for "moral corruption in a class corresponding to the accusation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The event reportedly took place in June 2009 in a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting each other at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he must have raped her anal according to the reported report in Clark County City Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "a good guy 99% of the time" caught by "one percent".
The case papers say Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and was photographed in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an agreement outside the court, because she felt "bang for retaliation" and worried about being "publicly excluded".
The 34-year-old is now saying that she wants to overthrow the deal, as she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on a shift from Manchester United to Real Madrid when the event was due to take place, and changed this summer to the Italian big club Juventus for 100 million €.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will forever regret" to lose car manufacturers
Britain "will regret it forever", if it lost its status as leading car manufacturer worldwide after Brexit said business minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was 'concern' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily lower production at the Burnaton plant near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting at the border in case of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produced Toyotas Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, where 90 % of these were exported to the rest of the EU.
"As I see it, production will stop at our factory if Britain goes out of the EU at the end of March," said the Managing Director at Burnaton, Marvin Cooke.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, express fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says that they will close their Mini factory in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is to address the risks of the supply chain in the event of an withdrawal without an agreement.
Toyota's production runs on a tight schedule, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems could arise at the border, which, according to the car industry, could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day's production at the Derbyshire factory, and then production would be stopped, the company said.
Clark says that Theresa Mays Chequer's plan for future negotiations with the EU is "combined so that we can avoid them precisely at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best deal that does not just allow us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The statements from Toyota and other manufacturers point out that we need to be able to continue what has been successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would have stopped, but in the longer term higher prices would reduce factory competitiveness, which in the end would cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaton for 24 years and is a joint trustee at the factory, says that his members are becoming more and more concerned: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they won't come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says The White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with the Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein can "be postponed one more week", as the task of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues," said The White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein looks at the special prosecutor Robert Mueller over his shoulder during his investigation of Russian electoral interference, relations between Trump's assistants and Russia and the potential obstacle to the President's course.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Justice Minister, thereby risking Mueller's independence, has been the subject of a dispute in Washington for months.
The New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein was considering wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility to set off the president via the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and the rumor was that he would quit.
Instead, it was agreed to a Thursday meeting with Trump, which at that time was at the UN headquarters in New York.
Trump said that he would "do nothing" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a merger with the Senate Committee, where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who have accused him of sexual assault, had to testify.
Last Friday, Trump ordered a week of FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate's election.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was at Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed for a week with everything that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we have to see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press meetings was not due to TV journalists playing for the gallery, but added: "I don't disagree that they play up the camera."
She then said that the direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
"The president accepts more questions from the press than any president before him," she said and added without quoting a source: "We've looked at the numbers."
Press meetings will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We are trying to provide ample opportunity, and you have seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it will be in the place of the press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often responds to questions when he leaves the White House or attends open hearings or press meetings with high-ranking guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York the president showed why when he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the journalists present.
Health Minister contacts EU workers in the Scottish Health Service following Brexit concerns
The Minister for Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish for them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain withdraws from the European Union.
The Government of Scotland has already undertaken to pay itself for applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on withdrawal are continuing, and it seems that decisions are expected in the autumn.
But the British Government has also increased their preparation for a possible Brexit without an agreement.
I know it must be a very uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the efforts made by each employee regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from and outside the EU come with valuable experience and competences that strengthen and improve the work of health care in the benefit of patients and local communities.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would very much like you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie has acute surgery after head injury
The lineback from Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie was acutely operated after having suffered a head injury in Saturday’s 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores, reports it from Tennessee Mike Organ.
First Coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the incident took place before the break.
"He went out to the sideline and just fell out there," said Reed.
Coach and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before laying him on a stretcher and taking him in for further examination.
A spokesperson from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are not "any details of the type or extent of the damage yet", and Tennessee State is trying to find out when he was dealing with the damage.
Abercrombie studies in the second year and is in the process of her first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before he left the game, giving him 18 tackles collected this season.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when they buy houses in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK.
This move will dampen Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects that it will provide the homeless with $120 million a year.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp fee when they buy properties in the UK, for the benefit of the homeless.
The draft will be considered an attempt to respond to Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper dwellings and to pursue them with the highest income.
The rise in stamp duty will hit people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK. The profit from this will be used for the government's fight to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The additional fee, which is added in addition to the current stamp tax and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-house purchases and purchases to rent, can reach 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to raise 120 £ million a year.
It is estimated that 13 % of new constructions in London are bought by people living abroad, which makes prices rise and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "spray villages" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new bill comes only weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in stamp duty to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices up by buying reasons they don't use. He asked May to drop quotas on cheap dwellings to solve Britain's "bad housing situation."
Corbyn has proposed an eye-catching series of housing reforms, including the control of rent prices and the removal of the landlord's ability to put people on the street if they comply with the lease contract.
He will also strengthen the possibility of building public housing.
May said: "Last year I said I would use my Presidency to restore the British dream; that life will be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who will live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be that it is as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the United Kingdom to buy homes as for hardworking British.
For many, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the value of sleeping on the street is still too widespread."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become Scotland's coach."
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "ultimate goal" is at a time to become Scotland's coach.
The 42-point shot enjoys the challenge of resuscitation of the North East club, which now has a third place in League One, three points from the top.
He changed to the Stadium of Light this summer after looking for St Mirren back in the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country playing.
"I played a game with the B team, and that's it," said Ross BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it has always drawn me.
However, that option would only arise if I was successful in training clubs."
Ross' predecessors who train for Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach for Alloa Athletic says he did not have any concerns about following after such established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I'm painting success from whether 'I can get this club back in the Premier League.'
From the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly hears at home in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I'll probably only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years into the career training after a period of assisting coaching at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart's coaching staff.
Then he helped Alloa come back after he had moved down in the third order and transformed St. Mirren from the root of the horse to the title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real way to get a divorce," he recalls the time in Alloa.
"I sincerely thought that training was the right thing for me, more right than playing.
It sounds strange because I did fine, worked wisely, and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There's a lot of things you're going through on a weekly basis.
There's still the kind of stress and pressure that train, but it just feels right.
I've always wanted to train, and now I'm doing it. I haven't felt more comfortable with myself in my entire adult life."
You can hear the entire interview at Sportsound on Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12.00 and 13.00 BST.
The best time for a beer is Saturdays at 5.30 p.m., showing examination
The heat wave this summer has increased the earnings of England’s pubs, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
Sales on pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while sales in restaurants went down 4.8%, showing figures.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA, said: "Continued sunshine and England's unexpected long World Cup has meant that July follows the pattern of June, where pubs experienced more sales of 2.8 %, except that the restaurants have been harder hit now.
The 1.8% drop in restaurants in June only got worse in July.
Pubbers and bars with a focus on the sale of beverages made it clearly the best and experienced progress similar to the decline of restaurants.
Pubber with focus on food led in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want something to drink.
Across the pub and bar chains, sales of beverages increased by 6,6 % for the month, while food decreased by 3,3 %."
Paul Newman, who analyses the service industry, said: "The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales on the out-of-home market, weather and major social or sporting events are the main factors.
It is no surprise that the restaurants are still fighting, although a drop in sales of 4.8% year after year will do very bad at the rising costs.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will give a much needed breather room."
The total increase in sales combined for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2,7 % in July, which shows the decline in newly started fires.

Every fifth child has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
Each fifth child, down to 11 years of age, has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers, showing investigation.
A study of 20,000 schoolchildren in the 4th-9th grade reveals growth in fake Insta pages.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content is being added up
20% of students said they have a "principal account" that they can show their parents
Every fifth child, down to 11 years of age, creates accounts on the social media that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 students from the 4th grade reveals strong growth in "false Insta" accounts – a reference to Instagram image sharing service.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content being added up.
20% of students said they have a "principal account" that they can show their parents while they also have private.
A mother who fell over her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, so a teenager who called on others to rape me.
The study by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) for private schools found that 40 % of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to have private accounts.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "It's scary that so many teenagers are tempted to make online profiles where their parents and teachers can't find them.
Elidh Doyle will be the voice of the athletes on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as the Board of Scottish Athletics at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most winning athlete, and President Ian Bettie described the shift as a good opportunity for those who make decisions on sport to benefit from her great 10-year experience at international level.
"Eilidh enjoys great prestige in the athletic world in Scotland, Great Britain and the rest of the world, and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will benefit from getting her on the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I will try to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope that I can contribute and help set out a direction for sport in Scotland."
The American, who won two of his four Olympic gold medals in the 200- and 400-metre runs at the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, and now often commentator of the BBC, could not go after a transitory ischemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote: "A month ago I was struck by a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time would show if I would get on top of it and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm perfectly well, I've learned to walk again and do today agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertation for breast pump that compares mothers to cows gets mixed reception online
A breast pump company has shared opinions online with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to cows that are milked.
In order to mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent chest pump", the technological consumer magazine has released a sarcastic music video-inspired advertising to show the freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a valley filled with hay for a song in which it says, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see any tail" and "If you hadn't noticed this, this isn't a yvere, it's my breasts."
It says, "Pum it out, pump it out, I feed my baby, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my bosom."
But the advertising, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has led to controversy online.
With 77,000 shows and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed reception from the viewers. Many say it makes fun of the "smokers" in the milk industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and feed before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth", wrote a user.

Another wrote: "Consequently traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another one added: "Such an insensitive advertisement."
Others defended the commercials, and a woman admitted that she thought the song was "inconceivable funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I would have had one.
Breast-feeding made me feel exactly like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: "It's a funny advertisement aimed at mothers pumping milk (often in their workplace or in toilets) and feeling like 'cows'.
It is not an advertisement that commends or criticises the milk industry."
At the end of the video, women reveal that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept of advertising is based on the fact that many women who nurse say that they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely silent, has no pipes or hoses and fits discreetly in an amme bra, giving women freedom to move, keep their children and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, a partner and director of Mother, wrote: "The pump from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between breast-feeding mothers and dairy cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping, while in a entertaining and recognisable way we showed the freedom that the new pump can give."
It's not the first time that the pump from Elvie made headlines.
In London Fashion Week a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to camp at the Texas border
The number of children who have been detained has exploded, even though the number of border guards has not changed. It is partly due to a tougher rhetoric and Trump administration's scrapper laws that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared their ability to remain in the country by standing up and receiving a child.
The return risk increased in June when the authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household should give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, witnessed the Congress and told them they had arrested several people who sought to sponsor unsubstantiated minors.
The management later confirmed that 70 % of the arrested had complete criminal record.
"Closed to 80 % of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors' households are illegally resident in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
So we're still chasing those people," said Albence.
In trying to deal with children's cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules that require some of them to meet in court within one month of their detention.
Many use video calls instead of self-opening and speaking their case for legal residence to an immigration judge.
Those who are convicted of residence shall be deported quickly.
The longer children stay in care, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outcomes or attempts to escape, says relief workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
People who advocate better conditions say that these risks are more pronounced on larger plants like Tornillo, where the size makes it harder to keep an eye on the suffering of a child.
They added that relocation to a village of tentland without mental preparation or opportunity to say goodbye to friends can accumulate traumas that many already struggle with.
Syria informs American, French and Turkish "capture forces" that they must withdraw immediately
When Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem spoke to the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country is now in his eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the stay of foreign forces in the country is illegal and under the pretext of combating terrorism, and they will "be met with similar means."
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war against terror "nearly over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have fled from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "to fight this decisive war until we have cleared all Syrian territories" for both terrorist groups and "mere foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria who primarily train and advise Kurdish and Syrian-Arab forces who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war - torn country.
In the field of refugees, Moualem said that the situation was good enough for them to return home, after which he accused "some Western countries" of "spraying unfounded fears" that led the refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to assist in facilitating these returns," he said.
"They're policeting what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no help will be made available to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to set up a buffer zone in the last great rebel-controlled city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
On the basis of the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack by Syrian forces, supported by Russia, was avoided against the province, where three million live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would follow jihadists from the Nusrafront, a group of sources of Al-Qaeda, as "will be destroyed".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee to outline a postwar Constitution for Syria and pave the way for an election.
Moualem has set conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee and states that the work of the panel must be limited to "the review of the legislation of the present Constitution", and warned against interference.
That's why Trump wins another presidential term.
Based on this logic Trump is probably re-elected by 2020, unless the cause of the kingdom and the scandals closes his presidential term early, as many liberals hope.
In what undoubtedly is "the most dramatic end of a presidential period ever!"
Currently, there is no sign of seeing fatigue.
Since 2014, the ratings in the best broadcast time have almost doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best time for comparison with 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBCs The Rachel Maddow Show has the most viewers with up to 3.5 million in the evenings with great news.
"It's a spectacle that people are attracted to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, leader of the ABC-dramaet Designed Survivor of a head of the cabinet, who becomes president after an attack destroys the congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy author and writer behind "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he wanted to vote on Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh," said Scovell.
Kaosset has entertainment value.
However, unlike all other television programs, the stories from Washington can decide between Roe and Wade whether refugee families can be restored and the health of the world economy.
Changing the channel is only the most privileged wonder.
And yet it's about more than being informed to the citizen when you see six hours of panel discussion where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background", when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's ostriches jacket at $15,000 ("clothed with hybris", wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' living descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
I'll never see Super Mario in the same way.
"Some of what makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, managing director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump Show's rotating crew and daily surprises (scannings with N.F.L., rose to Kim Jong-un.)
But if you miss a paragraph, you're off.
When I got to Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and saw MSNBC while he was filming CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was to be heard in the Senate Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court had to be decided.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows before, and people said, 'It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Big sums find their way to the close mid-term elections to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district receives large sums of money. As a result of a compensation of two "Congressive Districts" two congressmen are fighting for the same seat.
This newly reorganised suburbs in Pittsburgh creates problems for the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special elections last spring.
Lamb opposes another currently sitting congressman, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17.
The maps were remade after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January, condemning the illegality of the old district in the favour of the Republicans.
The struggle for the new 17th district has started a battle for financial resources between the committees of the major parties, the Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republic of Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a election with high vigilance in March's special election for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seed has been on the hands of the Republicans for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a little advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for support for China, but reorganised itself
Diplomater noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already acknowledged Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners threw Trump’s management team out.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call leading American diplomats back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognise Taiwan" said Heather Nauert, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman in a notification earlier this month.
But it was only El Salvador that was punished. They got about 140 million dollars of the United States in 2017 for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which include cuttings of financial assistance and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials held a summit on security and economic development, which should continue to have last year's meeting, which was seen as a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
However, in mid-September, topembecs made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway, and thus dropped the considerations of punishment to El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has to speak to the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to send a signal of the importance the Americans attach to the meeting, said diplomats.
And the three Americans secretly sent train back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh demands or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton from the White House did not wish to comment on the details of the case, which were described by three American officials, including two diplomats who would like to talk about internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the basis of an anonymity condition.
Know the story
The next obstacle could well be the special prosecutor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to the investigation, for which there are considerable and publicly available evidence.
Reportedly, Mueller will also direct his investigation into the question of whether Trump's campaign secretly cooperated with Russia on the attack on the elections.
If Congress were to come to new hands, Trump would probably be held responsible while he is preparing to meet the voters again and, of course, eventually a jury of his companions.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not claim that Trump's finality is inevitable – and the same goes for his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we must all make choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
In 1938 German officers were ready to put in a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had been able to resist him by supporting the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbathing thereafter.
It is about such turning points that the axis of history is turning and the insurmountable march of democracy is losing or losing.
Several of these turning points are now being faced in the United States.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who decides the future of Mueller's investigation, Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been warm since the present newspaper could announce that he had proposed last year to make hidden recordings of the President and challenge his suitability for office.
According to Rosenstein, the production of the Times is unprecise.
"How do we respond if F.B.I.'s recently sought-after investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is stopped or not properly carried out – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, more importantly, will we vote in favour of a Congress that will hold Trump responsible for the mid-term elections?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we're doing it.
My mother was a Czech Jew, who was deported to Auschwitz by the very same Nazi regime, who once occupied my embassy's homeland.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath light on the table with the china cross.
How can I be anything but optimistic about that in my luggage?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic ahead of the fight against SK Rapid Wien
Rangers take Thursday to SK Rapid Wien. After the impressive outcome in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, with a victory against the Austrians, they will have good opportunities to move forward from Group G of the European League.
A knee wound prevented midway player Graham Dorrans from getting the season debut before the 2-2 fight against Villaarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a springboard for something even bigger.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the fight with the belief that we could bring something home, and we got a point.
Maybe we could have taken the sting home, but all in all, it was probably a reasonable result.
They were probably the best in the first half game, but we came out in the second half game and were the best team.
Thursday will be another great European evening.
We're hoping to get three points, but it's going to be hard because they got a good result in last battle, but with the audience behind us, I'm sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
Last year has been hard because of everything that happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can ride now, put the last season behind us, and get a success."
Anxiety over pension savings makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared for, only few spoke to the family about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study reported that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent told them they were talking to their children about it.
"Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do anything to start the conversation," says Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide's Life Insurance.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your mate and children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not tell them your wishes in good time.
Use your advisor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices can be crucial factors in the cost.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term care can be financed using, among other things, traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payment or self-insurance with your own resources – as long as you have an economy for it.
Get the legal documents fixed: Take the legal battles out.
Get prepared an authorization so that you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure that doctors and healthcare professionals comply with your wishes in case you cannot communicate yourself.
Consider also a full economic power.
In that case, you will appoint an trusted person who can make financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you do not have the option.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that one of your aged parents needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergy?
Get all of these details down to write, so you're ready.
"It's not just a question of the economy – who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What medicine?
Who's watching the dog?
Get the plan in place."
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a road in town.
The victim was in the 40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, the middle floor and the hand.
Officers describe the shooting, which took place around 2:30 p.m., as "all by chance."
The victim didn't see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police call on witnesses to stand up.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and a tsunami which, Friday, hit the Indonesian city of Palu.
Since communications routes are out of the question, emergency relief workers have not been able to receive information from the Regent Dongala, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake struck.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesian province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379.800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regent that extends over over 300 km of coastline on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
In 2017, the government, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the Central Sulawes economy, especially in the Donggala coastal area.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but takes place mainly in Morowali, which is the coast opposite to Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's disaster centre, Palu and Donggala have been hit several times in the last 100 years by tsunamis.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was hit again by a tsunami that killed nine.
Indonesia is seismically on the so-called fire in the Pacific and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the greatest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered on 26 December a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, including more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in the late March and only in April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake measuring 6.8 hit south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, and triggered a tsunami that broke into the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 hit near Padang City, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake measuring 7.5, hit one of the Mentawai islands from Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya Regent in Aceh and spread destruction and panic when the population was reminded of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
Not one tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by the crashing buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin’s oldest son charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and Deputy President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
Twenty-nine-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska was arrested following suspicion of domestic violence, preventing the notification of domestic violence and in order to resist arrest, according to the report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin's incarcerated in Mat-Su Pretoral Facility with a $500 guarantee without security, reports KTUU.
He was brought to court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty at all," reporting the network.
Palin is charged with three Class A offences that can lead to a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B offence, which can lead to a sentence of one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not the first time that Palin has been charged with crimes.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently being dealt with at Alaska's Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, to prevent the notification of a violent crime at home, as well as the possession of weapons in affected state in connection with the incident.
His boyfriend accused him of having hit her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups after explaining his son's violent conduct with PTSD as a result of his posting in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake on Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi struck.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and means of communication, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit right south of central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On the social media there are videos that show the moment when the earthquake strikes.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu, when the tsunami broke to the coast.
Public prosecutors are trying to get terrorist suspects in NYC sentenced to a rare death penalty
Public prosecutors are trying to have the death penalty sentenced to Sayfullo Saipov, suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people – a rare sentence that was last sentenced to a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov reportedly used a car rental from the Home Depot building market to carry out an attack on a roadway along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who got in the way were killed.
As a basis for the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "willfully" killed the eight victims and "willfully" caused serious injury, which is required by the declaration of intent for death in the southern district of New York.
According to the legal document, the death penalty is a possible result of both opinions.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury could present Saipov with a 22-point appeal, including eight charges of murder in the case of gangsters, typically used by public prosecutors in organised crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "extensive planning and preparation", the prosecutors said and described Saipov's execution as "unscrupulous, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, bodily injury and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," says the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York's southern district last raised the defendant in a case with the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murder of two drug suppliers, but ended up getting life-long imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was most recently condemned in a state case in New York in 1953. At that time, the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov originated from Uzbekistan and, according to legal documents, did not show any evidence of evidence in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he spoke to the investigators that he was doing well.
According to the charges, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag hung up at his hospital room, told the cops.
He's denied himself guilty of the 22 points of the Prosecution.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that they "were, of course, disappointed" over the prosecutors' decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and life-long prison sentence without the possibility of release will only extend the trauma to all those involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Conservative Minister considers that NIGEL FARAGE should take over the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the peoples' army" during a demonstration at the conservative meeting today.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians had to be able to "mark the pressure" of the Eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May's own ministers had said that Farage should take over negotiations with the EU.
The private Conservative Member, Peter Bone, said to the Birmingham demonstration that Britain would have "be out now" if Farage had been a Brexit negotiator.
May's challenge in terms of creating a gathering in the deeply divided party is underlined by the fact that Conservative Remainers participate in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan on track during attacks by both the British, the Remainers and the European Union.
Her allies insist that, despite the withdrawal, she will continue to seek an agreement with Brussels – thereby forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or "kaos".
To the demonstration Leave Means Leave in Solihull, Bone announced that he would scrap the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given him responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we would have been out now," he said.
The Minister of Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must scrap Chequers."
On the background of his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be anybody's subordinates.
We will determine our own laws in our own country."
Bone refused that the public opinion should have changed since the 2016 vote: "That the British people should have changed their mind and would like to remain in the EU is quite wrong."
The conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told the journalists: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is unpopular in the broad population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists who are actually on the street and get us elected.
Drop the Chequers and start listening.'
As a point of reference to May, she added: "Premier ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the film that politicians must be able to "mark the pressure" if they fail to vote in 2016.
"It is now a question of trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They'll betray Brexit, but we're gathered to tell them that we won't let them get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "You must make sure that the political class who is on the run to betray Brexit can feel the pressure.
"We are mobilizing the people's army here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until we have become an independent, self-directed and proud UK."
In the meantime, the renaissants marched through Birmingham before a two-hour drive in the city center.
Spread activists fanned with Conservative Mod Brexit-banner after the formation of the group this weekend.
The LAB Lord Adonis, prior to the meeting, made fun of the security issues with the conservatives' party app.
"These are the people who claim to be in charge of IT systems and technology to Canada, to border controls, to free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he said.
"It's ridiculous.
There is nothing called a good Brexit," he added.
Warren "considers strongly" to stand up to the presidential elections
Member of the House of Representatives, Senator Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly to run the presidential elections" following the mid-term elections in November.
According to Boston Globe, the democrat from Massachusetts spoke of his future during a council meeting on Saturday in the Western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticised Donald Trump, will in November try to achieve reelection against the Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
One has wondered if she would challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the voters at the town hall since Trump took over the office.
A participant asked her if she's planning to run for the presidential elections.
Warren replied that it is time for "women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it takes a woman to go to the front."
Arrest on LSU's Sims
The Baton Rouge police announced Saturday that on Friday a suspect was arrested for the shooting at Wayde Sims, the basketball player from LSU.
The Baton Rouge police announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested Friday for an ET news meeting at 11.
They had on Friday released a video of the shooting to ask for help identifying a man on the footage.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was hit by shots in his head and killed by the injuries," said police chief Murphy J. Paul, medium 247s.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and claimed to have been present, in possession of a weapon and to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and is now in police custody in the East Baton Rouge district.
Sims was a two-meter-high third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. In the last season he played 32 games, started in ten and played on average 17.4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russia's grand prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the World Championship, after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valturi Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team would play a decisive role in the race.
From the leadership position, Bottas got a good start and was close to slowing Hamilton off completely when defending his position in the first two turns and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel ran a pit like the first one, and let Hamilton fight the traffic at the back of the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes car went for a spin later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back in front, as the Ferrari driver after some wheel contact was reluctantly allowed to leave the inner track after a double defense at third turn.
Max Verstapp started from the rear row and was number seven after the first round of its 21st birthday.
Then he led a large part of the race when, in an attempt to rapid completion, he failed to change decks to take Kimi Raikkonen’s fourth place.
He had to go to pit at 44th round, but could not increase the tempo of the last eight rounds, so Raikkonen secured the fourth place.
"It's a tough day because Valtteri made it great all weekend and really was a gentleman when he let me come by.
The team did an incredible job to secure us both first and second place," said Hamilton.
Really Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a election meeting on Saturday because she insisted that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At an election meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention the testimony that Ford had given before the U.S. Senate judicial committee, but said instead that the events in the Senate showed that people were "bad and repulsive and dishonest".
"The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and cruel and repulsive and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at words and leaks, and then they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember that?
Diane Feinstein, was it you who leaked it?
Remember her answer... was it you who leaked the document – "Oh, uh, what?
No, no.
I didn't leak anything."
Hey, wait a minute.
No, we haven't leaked anything," he added in a imitation of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter about Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's accusations, and I haven't leaked her story," Feinstein said to the comedy according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I have done so."
But her denial was not well received by the president, as during Saturday's election meeting said: "I tell you that it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
During the President's continued defense of the nominated judge to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual abuse by three women, Trump suggested that the Democrats use the accusations to benefit their own cause.
"They avoid any means in their efforts to withdraw power.
You can see the wickedness, the disgustingness, they don't care who they're supposed to believe in getting power and control," said the President of Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars versus Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars did it again after Friday's lost Elite League match against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return match in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants came quickly ahead with two targets with attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie settled on their home before Dwyer brought Giants back in front.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before Luke Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory by two more goals.
It was the third year's Elite League nederlag for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 on Friday's game in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides where Giants went out as victors in the three previous battles.
Dwyer posted in the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assist from Kendall McFaul with David Rutherford as an assist when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy course, Sullivan brought back the home team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt stood behind Cownie's compensation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Giants came ahead at first break when he scored his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard again compensated with a fine target at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen lead Dundee ahead for the first time in the battle late in the second period, and he secured victory with the fifth goal of the team halfway through the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four of their five games, is home in Milton Keynes for their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller died to ensure hundreds of passengers escaped earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he died to make sure that a plane with hundreds of passengers was safely dropped to the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many have been missing after a major earthquake last Friday, the Sulawesi island hit and triggered a tsunami.
Forced tailquakes still harden the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung's colleagues fled for life, he refused to leave his seat in the floating control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was held on the runway, was probably in the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was falling apart.
He died later in the hospital.
According to the Australian ABC News, the spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a major hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're broken," he added.
The authorities fear that the death rate can reach thousands, and the country's emergency response announces that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death rate is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins, and it is not possible to arrive at them," said the spokesman Suttopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, which holds a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are flying in emergency and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to Sky News: "Every minute a new ambulance comes with more bodies.
There's a lack of clean water.
All the stores have been robbed."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we do not know what we come up with.
It is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work round the clock to carry out all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" said he, according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombrok earlier this year, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini: Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says that a man is missing, although it had previously been reported that all 47 passengers and crew members were evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
According to a press release, Air Niugini stated that Saturday afternoon could not locate a male passenger.
The airline announced cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and police forces to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned to requests for more information about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats were helping to save the other passengers and crew, after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were in the hospital.
The airline states that six passengers stayed at the hospital until Saturday and that they were all in a stable state.
It is still not clear what caused the crash and the exact order of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say that the aircraft landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane flew past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very low water.
"It was really lucky," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers could go into water to get to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the crew panicked and yelled and he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Marine said that sailors who worked to renovate a quay nearby also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to transport people ashore before the plane sank at about 30 metres depth.
Data from Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analysts set the timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The Appellate Authority terminated its investigation on Saturday under the appeal of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analysts in the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, gave testimony for several hours as an expert in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used telecommunications information to merge the course of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said that he got location data from several different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to his previous claims, writes The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time he had claimed that he, along with his friend Michael Sanford, visited Sanford.
Sanford sat down on the stand Saturday and told him he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "Low because my truck was in Nashville".
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks after she died.
The mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death Tellis had deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defence is scheduled to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that day.
The High Breed: What is political hip-hop?
A hiphoptrio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol believes that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They will return to the starting point and make political hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently received a Revival in Britain because of artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
Baby girl in New York suing couple after firing with "racist" texting
A nanny in New York suing a couple for discriminatory firing after having received a text message by mistake from the mother complaining that she was "still a black person".
The couple denied that they were racists, but compared the case with "expression".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed her dismay at finding out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEJ, NOT A SORRY PERSON," wrote Plasco-Faxman to his husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, it fired the "inconvenient" Plasco-Flaxman Giselle Maurice and said that their former nanny, who from Africa-American, had been bad at her job and that she instead expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for one day's work and sent home in a Uber.
Now Giselle Maurice is suing the couple to get compensation for the firing and compensation for $350 a day in the six months in which she should have lived with the family, although this was agreed without a contract.
"I'd like to show them that you can't afford to do something like that," she said to the newspaper Friday and added "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have defended themselves that they are not racists and that the firing of Maurice was justified because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife had come to send her something that she wouldn't have said.
She's not racist.
We're not racists," said Joel Plasco to The Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone to whom you had been rude even if it had happened by mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the case to "expression" and that his wife had been born two months earlier and found herself in a very difficult situation.
"Do you really go after someone like that?
This is not very friendly done," added the investment advisor.
Even though the trial is still under way, the CJEU has already written off the couple on social media and destroyed their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publisher feared that readers could not relate to a talking bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was recorded for publication, said of the letter: “It’s hard to imagine being the one who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's pretty funny to read now when you know how popular Paddington became."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC, before being inspired to write the children's book about a little stripe, would have been optimistic, even though his story was rejected, and that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "bittered" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father in all modesty was proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't like to boast," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt like you had a child who achieved something: You are proud of them, even though it is not really your profit.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity in that way.
Even though it was his work and his imagination, he used to say it was Paddington's fault."
Said goodbye to dying daughter over the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors in vain tried to save her life.
"Nad called at regular intervals to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn't survive," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that she would die in the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my darling.
I'll see you soon.
I'll see you later.
The medication she had received to keep her heart going slowly lost their effect.
She was dead short before, and now the body shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try and get together."
Finally, the grieving Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane with the other passengers who did not know what she was going through.
"No one knew that," she said.
"I bent my head, and tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Griefing women try to stop suicide jumpers
Two women who have lost relatives to suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey have mapped a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he was depressed and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to experience the grief I experience every day," she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with an infected smile.
"His smile was known to everyone.
People said his smile lit up the room."
However, he stopped working before he died because he felt really bad.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him after he took his life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid if it spreads."
Sharon Davis made the cards to "tell people that there are someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don't go with your thoughts – you have to talk to someone."
Sharon Davis' long-year-old friend Kelly Humphreys lost his girlfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about him being sad or depressed or anything," she said.
"Some days before Christmas he began to change.
When the children opened their presents, he had no eye contact with them at all."
She said that his death was very traumatic for them, but that they have to get through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
It's torn us apart.
But we all have to continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still unsolved while the FBI is starting an investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked – a limited amount of time study – we could perhaps get a little consensus," Fllake said on Saturday and added that he feared that the comet "fall from the other" in the middle of the locked partial situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican support not have the FBI doing their investigation?
Your discretion is due to timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if, as expected, the Republicans do badly, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they would like to have elected to the highest judge in the country.
George W. Bush has called Senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and then met his wife Ashley, who was Bush' personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI finishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unknown whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the decisive vote and elect him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean droppers falling under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean shoppers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from South Korea's Department of Reconciliation and said that there were 1,127 shoppers last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher figures due to human smugglers contributed to the changed figures.
Pyongyang has not given any official comments.
The vast majority of North Korea's shoppers are eventually offered citizenship in South Korea.
The Government of South Korea states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border facing North Korea and which is easier to cross than the difficult guarded demilitarised zone between North and South Korea.
China sees it as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, so they are often forced to go home.
The relationship between North and South Korea – which is technically still at war – has greatly improved over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to talk about the stranded negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This is happening after the historic meeting in June between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work against an atomic-free Korea at a global level.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances it is ruled out that we will crush ourselves," said Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterically" and says he's unfit for the Supreme Court.
Chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court judge, "hysteric" and said that his temperament was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi's comment came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like that, she would have been called hysterical," said Pelosi of his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh rejected emotional accusations that he had committed a sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he spoke of his family and his years in high school, he almost cried and was crying.
He also condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him "grotesque and coordinated characterism" arranged by the left, who was angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidency in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not sit in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was pre-emptive to the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with the statements and the way he went after the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
When she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to a kingdom if he was confirmed and if the Democrats were to receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'd like to say that if he's not telling the truth about Congress or the FBI, he's not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, but certainly also in the court he's in now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions in connection with Obama's health reform or abortion case Roe v. Wade because he considered to be a conservative judge.
During the hearings Kavanaugh did not answer questions as to whether he would reverse certain previous Supreme Court decisions.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, preconceived person must challenge a job as a judge and expect us to say 'yes, it's not just wonderful'," said Pelosi.
And women have to use it.
It is a just outcome, several months and years of anger that will hold on, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's abnormal.
She continued: "I received great support from a woman who was the boss who said that she also cried when she was angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she was angry and started to cry, she would say to whoever she was talking to: "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are thoroughly misunderstood.
One of my most obvious memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with an overweight of men where I often cried out of anger, where I was taken at the neck of an elderly woman – a cold boss who I had always been a little afraid of – and pulled out onto the stairs.
"You must never let them see that you are crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They'll think you're sorry, and they'll accept that they got to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Congress of the Democrats from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was exposed in having an affair on a boat named Monkey Business and withdrew as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and found that she could just as well set herself up as a presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a very well thought out decision," she laughed to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the run-up, and they certainly did not need another candidate.
Some called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was in the back with fundraising, so she promised that she would not participate unless she collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave a thousand dollars to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she gave a speech about not getting up, she was overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to raise money and reach voters instead of voters, and anger over sexism – that she had a lump in her throat.
"You could think I had a nervous merger," Schroeder recalls how the press reacted to her.
"One would think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what are you gonna write on my gravestone?
"She cried"?
In this way, the trade war between the United States and China could be an advantage for Beijing.
The openings of the trade war between the United States and China were loud, and although the battle is far from over, division between countries can be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, says experts.
The US President Donald Trump fired the first notice shot earlier this year by imposing duties on important Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
In principle, the biggest escalation this week with new customs duties affecting goods worth USD 200 billion applies to half of all goods imported into the USA from China.
Beijing has paid back every time, most recently by imposing customs duties of 5-10 % on US goods for $60 billion.
China has vowed to follow the United States all the way, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to yield after just an interim period.
If it makes Washington withdraw their claims, that means they give in, but for China's President Xi Jinping it will be too embarrassing to bow to the United States.
Experts, however, say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the American pressure in the trade war can have a positive effect on China over the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
"A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can create a breeding ground for an economy that can get out of control in both countries, and it is actually much more dangerous than you thought," said Abigail Grace, research worker focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' to receive refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says that the country is ready for the refugees to return, asking for help to build the country that has been destroyed by the war of more than seven years.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government has continued to control the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore a normal state of affairs.
All the conditions are now in place for refugees to return to the country they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that hit their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million oxygen have fled from the country since 2011, when the war began.
A further six million people still in the country need emergency aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian Government would like to accept help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries which helped to support the rebellion.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won Ryder Cup 2018 and struck the American team 16.5 - 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy back when Captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points it required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had a hard time in most of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake on par 3 on the 16th hole, causing him to lose the game against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari did well in all rounds and became 1 out of a total of 4 players who have received 5-0-0 since 1979, where the tournament's current format began.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 of the lowest-ranked European player, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
No. 1 on the world order list, Dustin Johnson, dropped 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Veteran with eight Ryder Cups in the Bag, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's most winning European with 25.5 career points.
"I don't normally cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really glad to get that trophy back.
This is a team effort and I am glad that I could help," said a emotionally charged Garcia after the European victory.
He sends the falcon on to his farmer John Ram, who fell the American golfing Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single match Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It's a bunch of statistics for one of the best golfers ever to win 14 big titles, only by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had problems finding the shape with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, said after his team's disappointing display: "I'm proud of the guys, because they fought for the case.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe counter-play.
We lost.
Hat off for Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We want to regroup, and I want to work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move on.
I love the 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to lighten your hat.
