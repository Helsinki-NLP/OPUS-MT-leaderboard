Well - meaning stewards worry about “looking like fools ”
Some councillors have suggested changing their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, members of the council).
The concerns have come about because of a plan to change the name of the council to the district council.
All - class stewards are concerned that this might make them laugh.
One worker - group steward said that his group was concerned, for “it rides with Twp and Pwp. ”
For readers living outside Wales: in affluent means twp stupid and pwp means dirt.
A steward of the Plaid Cymbala group said that the whole group was “bad ” and made other suggestions.
A well - held steward said that his class had “open minds ” about the change of name, but pointed out that the word MWP and Muppet (flon) did not differ greatly.
In this context, it can be stated that the sharp letter w is presented in the same way as u in the Icelandic language.
The council, now working on a bill to present the changes in the name, said: “The local decision on all appointments with the members of the council will, of course, lie with the members themselves. ”
The Wales Government Law (The Government of Wales Act 2017) gave the committee authority to change its name.
In June, the council published results of a public poll showing great support for calling the council the council.
With regard to stewardship title, the WMP (Welsh Parliament Members) was selected, but MWP was given the most support by the public in the polls.
According to reports, stewards are now proposing other suggestions, but it may be difficult to reach an agreement with the chairman of the council, Elin Jones, who is to submit an bill for the change within a few weeks.
The bill on reform will also include other changes in how the council works, including rules on the exclusion of members of the board and the organisation of the committee.
Councillors will be able to make final decisions on their title when discussions on the bill begin.
Macedonians vote in elections to change their names
The voters will vote on Sunday about whether to change their name in “North Macedonia. ”
This matter was put under a vote to resolve a decade of conflict with the neighboring country of Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
For a long time, Athens has argued that their neighbor’s name in the north is equivalent to its land requirements and has repeatedly protested their requests for membership of the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the change of name, has said that he will not view election as valid.
However, supporters of the vote, including Mr Zaev, Prime Minister, have said that the change in the name of the European Union and NATO is simply the price to be paid.
St. Martin's church clock is a church in Harlem having troubles
“The older people I’ve been talking to said that before they could find a bar and a church on every corner,” said Mr. Adams.
“ Today there is neither one. ”
He said it was understandable that the size of the bar would be reduced.
“ People have other ways to meet” today, he said.
“ Children are no longer the centers of the neighborhood where people meet regularly. ”
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money that emanates from the sale of property will not only be as long as the leaders expect “and sooner or later they will be at the starting point. ”
He added that possibly there were churches that would be replaced outside residential buildings that would be filled with people who would not help save the future places of refuge in the neighborhood.
“ The vast majority of people who buy places in these buildings will be white, ” he said, “and, as a result, will speed up the permanent closure of these churches, since most of the people who move in these settlements are unlikely to be members of these churches. ”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the center of the black - Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin’s Church a decade later.
In the 1930 ’ s, the first white Methodist congregation was removed.
The congregation of black people who had worked nearby took over the building.
Under the direction of John Howard Johnson, the Black Church, who took over St Martin’s church, who took the initiative to sidetrack merchants on 125th Street, Harlem’s main street, who longed to hire black workers or to provide status increases.
In 1939, the building was seriously damaged by a fire, but members of the Special Assembly of Johnson made plans to rebuild it, and they also had the club build.
Father David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson, called his play proudly “the clocks of the poor people. ”
In July, the expert who played the game called it a second name, “A cultural treasure ” and“ a unique historical musical instrument. ”
The expert, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first play in the world that a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, played, but he moved to a bigger play in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin didn't get anyone else instead of him.
Over the past few months, many architects and contractors have gone to St. Martin, some of whom have been hired by church leaders and others by the bishops.
In July, the Church Council, which is the leader of the church, wrote the Episcopal District and expressed its concern that the bishop “will seek to pass the cost on to ” the church council, even though it had not been involved in the recruitment of the architects and the contractors sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the bishops.
A shark hurts a 13-year-old boy who suffocated for lobster in California
According to government officials, a shark attacked a 13 - year - old boy and injured him on Saturday when the boy was suffocating for a lobster in California on the first day of the lobster fishing season.
The attack took place just before seven o’clock in the morning near Beacon’s Beach Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been choking with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy yelling for help and then rode over along with a group of others to help him get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought that it was just a thrill to have a lobster, but then “it became clear to him that the boy cried out, ” he said,“ I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
All his bones were recalled," Hammel said of what he saw when he came to the boy.
“ I cried out to everyone, ‘ It’s a shark in the water! ’ ” Hammel added.
The boy was moved by a helicopter to the Rady Barna hospital in San Diego, where he was seriously wounded.
The type of shark that attacked the boy is not known.
The Coast Guard commander, Larry Giles, said at a press conference that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but he wasn't of a dangerous type of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe damage to the upper part of the body.
The authorities closed off from the Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to the Swami’s beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, for study and safety.
Giles said that over 135 different types of sharks were in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plan to hack into Britain’s cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s is going to race Boots, SuperDrug, and Debenhams with cosmetic shelves in mall style and with specialized assistants.
This is part of a plan to enter Britain’s cosmetics market, worth £2.8 billion and to increase as fashion and household goods are falling, and the bigger supermarkets will be tested in 11 stores all over the country and set up in more stores next year if they work well.
Investing in cosmetics is part of a supermarket to use a previously new shelf space of TVs, microwaves, and household goods.
Sainsbury’s claims are to double its choice of cosmetic products to up to 3,000 types of products, including trademarks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get increased space with marked areas similar to those found in stores like Boots.
The deal is also about to restart the sale of its Boutique brand choice so that the majority of the goods are vegan-friended, but younger users are demanding it to an ever greater extent.
In addition, the perfume store Fragrance Shop will test freight levels in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opened in Croydon in south-London last week and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
A Internet store and an increased trend for consumers to buy small quantities of food each day in local shops mean that large ones need to work harder to get people to come to their homes.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury’s, said that the stores would resemble malls to an ever greater extent as the chain of commerce tries to fight against Aldi and Lidl’s low - price stores with more services and goods than food products.
Sainsbury’s has placed an Argos camp in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitats since both chains were bought two years ago.
The first attempt by the store to revive its cosmetics and pharmaceuticals departments was not successful.
Sainsbury’s tried to cooperate with Boots around 2000 but this ended because of a conflict about how to share the proceeds of drug sales in the supermarket.
The new policy comes as a result of Sainsbury’s selling its 281 product stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyd’s product stores, at GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to the policy, Lloyds will play a role in these programmes by adding a high-level selection of luxury skin products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, marketing manager of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have completely changed the appearance of our cosmetic shelves to improve the environment for customers.
We also have investments in specific training for staff who will be within the scope of advice.
Our choice of branding is designed to meet all our needs, a healthy environment and a comfortable location make us an exciting cosmetic shop that converts old shopping habits."
Peter Jones 'Earth' after Holly Willoughby cancels an 11 million pounds contract
Peter Jones, a star from Dragon Den, became “Earth ” after television broadcaster Holly Willoughby withdrew 11 million pounds of contract with his company to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their home goods and parcels, Truly.
The company had been compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand.
Willoughby, 37 years old, in the parts of This Morning, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons’ The, with the pain of stillness by cancelling participation in a popular lifestyle company at the last minute to focus on new and profitable deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to Jones, at the headquarters of his commercial empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, when the popular TV woman admitted that she did not have enough time for her home and accompanying trade mark Truly for the new contracts worth up to GBP 1.5 million.
The company has been compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow, and was intended to double Willoughby’s property, its estimated value of GBP 11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced to Instagram that she was going to withdraw from Truly, Jones flew from Britain to live in one of her many summer homes.
A source reported: “Truly was the longest on Holly’s list of priorities.
This was to be her future project, which would take her over the next two decades.
Her decision to stop was completely in the open.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so short that the line went on the market.
There's a full layer of goods in Marlow's headquarters ready for sale."
Experts believe that the disappearance of this Morning, which is one of Britain’s most popular stars, can cost millions of companies because of high product prices, ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household goods, and possibly lead to further delay in the sale of the product line.
This could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends with Jones and Tora Capp for a decade.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined them as chairman of the board in March.
The couples spend their summer vacations together with Jones on 40 percent of Baldwin’s company, which produces television.
Willoughby will be an official representative of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as co-director of the ITV component I'm a Celebrity.
A close friend of Jones said last night: “We don’t want to say anything about his business. ”
“ And then we became in love ”
He guessed with the criticism he received from the media, for saying something that many would consider inappropriate to the President, and for being so positive toward the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump left so much?
I said Trump, and I copied a reporter's voice.
“ I haven’t given up anything. ”
He noted that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
On the other hand, talks about disbanding nuclear weapons have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the chief ambassador of North Korea, told the International Leader of the General Assembly of the United States on Saturday that the North had not received a “appropriate answer ” from the United States at the first steps of North Korea towards nuclear disarmament.
He said that instead, the United States continued to support its business prayers in order to maintain pressure.
Trump was all positive in his meeting talk.
“ We’re coming together with North Korea, ” he said.
“ We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions would have lost their lives.
"Now our relationship is great."
He said that his attempts to improve his relationship with Kim have resulted in a positive result - the missile tests had stopped, hostages had been released, and the earthly remains of U.S. soldiers were returned home.
He also warned of his unusual approach to discussing his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into a crowded stadium, there were only 200 people standing there,” said Trump, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
Floods and earthquakes in Indonesia cause great damage to the island, hundreds of which have been destroyed
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, international relief agencies were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the people of Lombok had to flee from their homes, there was no emergency, which is why an international organization can operate there.
“ Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it clear that they are not going to ask for assistance from international organizations, so that this is difficult,” said Ms. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children’s organization is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain when foreign workers can start work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, the spokesman for the country’s disaster relief agency, said that Indonesian advisers were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations should be allowed to assist in the relief work.
Compared with the prevalence of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is tragically ill - prepared to defend itself against the elements of nature.
The tidal waves have been built in Aceh, a rare sight at other shorelines.
It seems that the absence of a hydro-wave missile in Pala has still increased the number of casualties, even when warnings have been issued.
Even under the best of circumstances, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia can be challenging.
Natural disasters make planning even more complex.
A ship that has docked in Lombok to find victims of the earthquake is now on its way to Pala, which will take at least three days to get to the new accident site.
President Joko Wido made it a key element of his campaign to re-establish the setbacks of Indonesia’s transports, and he has put a great deal of money in the way of trains and railways.
However, there has been a lack of funding, but next year's vote will take place.
Mr. Joko also has to contend with a continuing tension between the religions of Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative religion.
Over 1,000 people died, and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as Christians and Muslims fought in the streets with pedestals, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.

Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing against Chelsea in the finals by challenging the 89th minute of Saturday’s game at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a shipment from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from the mark of Chelsea, his team below 1-0.
He rolled the ball to the left, and then he tried to hit a target toward the farthest.
The ball flew high and toward its right corner.
The ball eventually crossed Kepa Arrizabala, which jumped up, and into the net.
“I just wanted to try to get in that position, to catch the ball, and players like Shaq always play it as long as possible so I tried to create as much time as I could,” said Sturridge at LiverpoolFC.com.
“ I saw Kante come and touch him once and didn’t think so much about it, but I just took the shot. ”
Chelsea was over 1-0 in half after Belgian star Eden Hazard challenged in a minute.
In the parish, Chelsea-advisor gave the ball with a heel to Mateo Kovacic and then jump from the center to the half of Liverpool.
Kovacic put the ball in the middle fast.
Then he sent the ball forward magnificently and sent Hazard in for a visit.
Hazard ran his defenses off and scored in the back corner with his left foot past Alisson Becker, Liverpool’s goalkeeper.
Liverpool will be playing against Napoli in the backdrop of the Selection Department at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Napoli, Italy.
Chelsea goes against Videoton in UEFA at 3:00 a.m. on Thursday, London.

The police arrest a 32 - year - old, suspected of murder, after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has begun after a woman’s body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44 - year - old woman with a stab wound was found at 7:55 this morning near Grayson Mews on John Street and a 32 - year - old man was arrested, suspected of murder.
The police have encouraged people in the area to volunteer if they saw or heard something.
Brian O'Hagan, a researcher, said: “The investigation is just started, but I would ask all those in the vicinity of John Street, Birkenhead, to contact us if they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I also want to ask everyone, especially the driver of a taxi, who could have gotten something in the picture with their car cameras to contact us, because they could have important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who died lived in Birkenhead and that she was found inside an apartment.
In the afternoon, people who thought they knew the woman have come to ask where she was found this morning.
The study continues, and the police claim to work to inform the immediate members of the victim.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews tried to get back to his apartment, but police told him that no one could come into the building or leave it.
He was speechless as he discovered what had happened.
People have now been told that many hours could pass until they can go back in.
A police officer was told that the whole area is now regarded as a crime scene.

Any person who may have any information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crime Line anonymously on phone 0800 555 111 and give the number 247 from September 30.
The statue of the British Congress of Cromwell is the latest monument accused of “rewrite the story ”
The ban on the statue would be poetic justice for the destruction of the fanatic Puritan followers of so many cultural and religious deities of England.
However, the Cromwell Society said that Mr. Crick’s suggestion was “stupid ” and“ attempt to rewrite the story.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be before the beating.
The opposition of the English Civil War to cultural symbols was neither a decree nor an execution of Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas of the previous century.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, marks the spirit of the 19th century and is part of a man's history that many believe that still deserves praise.
To The Sunday Telegraph, Mr. Goldsmith said: “Cromwell is counted by many, perhaps late in the 19th century rather than today, as guardian of the council against external pressure, in his case the monarchy.
There is still a lot of historical difference as to whether this description is completely correct.
However, the conflict in the mid - 17th century may have shaped the development of our nation and that Cromwell is a well - known individual who represents one aspect of the conflict.
It is worthy to praise and remember his accomplishments as guardian of the kingdom."
Pigs attack a Chinese farmer and kill him
Pigs attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him in southwest China, according to local news.
The man named only by his last name “Youan” was found dead with a broken artery and covered with blood near a stake in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou district, according to South China Morning Post reports on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, in Xining, China, a pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine into pigs.
According to the report, he had traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the uncle found him dead and saw that the door into the nearby pig’s ladder was open.
He said that the inside of the path had been a big dissipation with a bloody mouth.
According to a court study, the 250 - kg [250 kg] bully had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My uncle’s feet were bloody and wounded,” said the uncle, with the last name “Wu”, at the Guiyang Evening News news office.
A recording from a security camera showed Yuan to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his uncle.
The owner of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked up, so that nobody else was attacked while the police collected evidence at the scene.
According to news reports, Yuan’s family and owners have a market share in discussions about compensation for his death.
Although rare, there are reports of pigs attacking people.
In 2016, a pig and her husband attacked their farm in Massachusetts and seriously wounded the man.
Ten years earlier, 300 kg [300 kg] of pigs squeezed a well - fed farmer into a tractor until his wife maimed the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba at CBC News told them that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that blood flavours can provoke aggression.
“ They’re just playing.
They like to grumble and be curious... they don't want to hurt anybody.
You just have to show them the kind of respect," he said.
The deposits of hurricaneed Rosa carry a great deal of rainfall over the southwest of the United States
As foretold, the strength of hurricane Rosa is decreasing as he crosses the cooler seas on the northern coast of Mexico.
On the other hand, Rosa will have a major spill that could cause floods in northern Mexico and southwestern America over the next few days.
Rosos became a hurricane in category 1, with wind speeds of about 136 km per hour, at 5 o’clock in the morning to eastern time on Sunday, and he was located over 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosos is scheduled to go north on Sunday.
At the same time, the Pacific is being developed and will head east toward the west coast of the United States.
Rosa will follow up to 25 cm of precipitation in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical race will be mixed with the near lows that form the vast and vast rainfall over the southwest during the next days.
Local emissions of 2.5 to 10 cm may result in dangerous rapid growth, soil movement, and potential slopes in the desert.
A large tropical flare will cause up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation at an hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation is expected in some areas of the southwest, especially in most Arizona state.
There is a possibility of fast - moving conditions because of the spread of tropical rain.
People are strongly advised against walking into the desert when there is a risk of tropical rain.
A great rain can turn the threads into flowing rivers, and thunderstorms bring wind and dust storms.
The nearing layer will carry local waste disposal in certain areas at the southern California shoreline.
There is a possibility of over 1 cm of waste that could cause a slight movement of soil and road noise.
This is the first result of the area during the rainy season.
A few scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before rainfall spread over a larger area late on Monday and Tuesday.
A great outcome will spread over four states on Tuesday and last Wednesday.
Major changes in temperature are expected in October, all over the United States, depending on what the Arctic region is cooling, but the tropical continues to be somewhat warm.
Sometimes this can cause extreme temperature fluctuations over short distances.
There was a very good example of a great heat difference in the central states of the United States on Sunday.
There is almost 7 degrees of heat between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
The next few days, a permanent summer mill will try to build up and scatter again.
A large portion of the Middle and East Americans are expected to warm early October with temperatures around 25 degrees or more from the southern plains to the northeast.
Fever may rise to 25 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees higher than the average.
Our long - term forecast indicates that there is a high likelihood of a temperature above the average for the Eastern United States in the early October.
Over 20 million people were looking for interrogations over Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh, the High Court judge, on Tuesday, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which was due to take place in the 1980 ’ s, and the witness was sent out on six different channels.
At the same time, the political policing continued and television stations interrupted a regular program to publish the latest news on Friday: Jeff Fllake, an elder from Arizona, presented a bill for the FBI to investigate the charges for one week.
Ford told the Senate Committee that she was confident that Kavanaugh had got her drunk and tried to undress her in a school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he was confident that this had not happened.
It is likely that more people have watched the trial than the 20.4 million that Nielsen reported that he had been watching on Friday.
The company measured average viewing of the TV channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not available immediately for other television channels that showed the interrogations, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has problems measuring people’s views in offices.
To put this in context, this audience is similar in size to a football final game or Oscar’s prize celebration.
According to Nielsen, most of the interrogators who took all day on Fox News Channel, or 5,69 million, have consistently supported Kavanaugh’s denial.
ABC was second with 3,26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the trial, great interest remained.
Fllake was the center of the hibernation game on Friday.
After the Office of this Republic Party Senator published an announcement that he would vote for Kavanaugh in favour, the CNN and CBS photographed him when protesters made a cry to him on Friday morning, he tried to go into a elevator to get a meeting with the Justice Committee.
He stood shut down for a few minutes while briefly raining over him live at CNN.
One woman said: “I'm standing right here in front of you. ”
“ Do you think he is telling the truth? ”
People told him: “You have authority while so many women stand powerless. ”
Flake told his office that he had made a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he said that he would be more expressing himself during the meeting of the committee.
The cable and cable stations were all broadcast live later when the Justice Committee called for Kavanaugh’s nomination to continue to election at the Senate.
Fllake said that he would only do that if the FBI examined the charges against the other appointments next week, but the minority of Democrats has encouraged that.
Flake was partially convinced after a conversation with his friend Chris Coons, Senator of the Democratic Republic.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several other senators thereafter.
Flake’s vote was divided because it was clear that the Republicans did not have sufficient votes to approve Kavanaugh without the study.
President Trump has granted permission for the FBI's investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh.
May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, accuses critics of ‘ playing political parties’ for Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Theresa May, prime minister, accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union to “be political” for the future of Britain and undermine the interests of the country.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, will be attending the Birmingham, UK, September 29, 2018.
In a second interview, published next to her interview on the cover page, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, claimed that the so-called Chequers programme on Brexit, said that the proposal for the UK and the European Union to charge each other’s tolls was “a serious omission. ”
Wayde Sims shooting: The police arrest Dyteon Simpsons in connection with LSU's death.
The police have arrested one suspect for Wayde Sims' death in a deadly shooting attack, who was a 20 - year - old basketball player at LSU.
The 20 - year - old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for second - grade murder, according to the Baton Rouge police.
The authorities released a video of the fighting between Sims and Simpson, saying that Sims has lost his glasses in the fights.
According to WAFB, CBS’s sister partner, the police found the glasses at the scene and said that they had found a gene from Simpson.
Police report that Simpson admitted to questioning that he shot Wayde and killed him.
According to his lawyer, a guarantee was made that the amount was $350,000.
An interim report on Friday, which says that the cause of death is a gunshot in the head and neck, was published by the court official of East Baton Rouge.
The authorities wanted to thank the Special Forces of Louisiana, police crime investigation, police at Southern University University, and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, head of LSU sports, thanked law enforcement “for their desirableness and seeking justice. ”
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall, two - foot - tall fronter grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and took 2.6 yields for each game during the last season.
Dr. Will Wade, LSU basketball coach, said on Friday morning that the team was “sharpened ” and“ in shock ” because of Wayde’s death.
“ This is something you’re constantly worried about, ” said Wade.
Volcano vomits ash over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention (U.S. Center for Disease Prevention) advised Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after an increase in activity and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions over a 24 - hour period.
The center watched the vibration and screens of the volcano.
Pictures on social media showed a thin layer of ashes on bus routes in Mexico City, such as in Xochimilco.
Earth physicists have observed increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 km southeast of the capital, since an earthquake of 7.1 on Richter’s ride over the middle of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as “Don Goyo, ” has been active since 1994.
Police in conflicts with Catalan separatists just before the birthday of independent compensation
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independent Protestants faced the riot police and thousands participated in protests on the occasion of the first birthday of the controversial elections in Catalonia to declare independence.
A group of masked separatists stoned the riot police with eggs and threw a dust paint that formed dark clouds of dust in the streets, which would usually otherwise be filled with tourists.
Another conflict broke out later the other day, and the police used bats to control conflicts.
“ We do not forget and do not forgive ” for a few hours while their opposers opposed, “Long live Spain. ”
A 14 - year - old suffered a minor injury in the protests, according to the local media.
A great deal of tension persists in the autonomous area one year after the National Act of October 1 was passed illegally by the Madrid authorities, but it was welcomed by the Catalan separatists.
The majority of voters chose independence, but participation was poor, as most of those who opposed separation ignored the election.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people in the previous year were injured when the police tried to stop the election at election stations across the region, which led to conflict.
The volunteers ’ groups had stayed out overnight on Friday to prevent protests in support of the country’s police.
The protesting march took place but was forced to take a different course.
Narcis Termes, a 68 - year - old electrical engineer, participated in the protests of separation with his wife, saying that he was no longer confident that Catalonia would gain independence.
“ Last year, we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy because they can choose, but now we sit fast," he said.
Despite having achieved the necessary but little victory in December’s regional elections, the self-employed groups of Catalonia have had difficulty holding steam this year, with many of their most well - known leaders either in voluntary exile or in detention for trial due to their role in the organisation of the vote and the declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who took the protest to support the police on his phone, said that the politicians of both states had encouraged the conflict.
“ The tension is increasing all the time, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been imprisoned, announced that he would be presenting himself to the European Parliament next year.
“My message in the European ESC is the best way to condemn the backwardness of democratic values and the oppression that we have seen the Spanish government employ,” he said.

Mend score to 1-0 victory of Livingston against Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga secured the victory of Livingston
Livingston, who came from the lower department, put Rangers in the open, and Steven Gerrard had to endure his second loss in 18 games as the manager of the Ibrox team.
Mark Dolly Menga did the trick and Gary Holt's team is now in second place with Hibernian.
L Gerrard has not yet worked in the finals of this season and is playing against Hearts, which is eight points ahead of the top, the next Sunday.
For that game the Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna in the European Division on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston is still undefeated in the league with six wins, and Holt the chief coach has not yet had to experience loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston Loss of Opportunity in Opportunity
Holt’s path should have been over long before it scored, but their bones caused the Rangers great trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then pushed past after running through the protection to receive a shell delivery from the Graig Halkett across the finish line.
The guests let Rangers play in front of them quietly, knowing that they could cause trouble in the right places.
And that is how the important goal was scored.
The Rangers got extra kicks and Livingston worked to create a target. Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga together, who accepted a shipment and scored from the middle of the visit.
At that stage, Rangers had controlled the ball, but the defense of the locals was unbreakable, and Liam Kelly, a goalkeeper, did not have to put forth much effort.
Thus it continued into the second half of the game, although Alfredo Morelos managed to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by the feet of Allan McGregor, the leader of the Rangers, and Lithgow shot from the mark after the search from Livingston.
Askers were constantly caught in the vitevisig Livingston but were kicked away, and two demands of vite fever--after protection Halketts against the warner Glenn Middleton, and one by one--the references were dismissed.
Livingston Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, journalist of the BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Excellent performance and performance for Livingston.
To a normal man, they did a wonderful job and continued to outdo all expectations on their way up.
Their style and team members have hardly changed anything since they got back into the highest division, but Holt is highly commended for having been putting the team together since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, the lead was extremely good and led a complete defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the toe all the time.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they have been under Gerard’s control, they played far under expectations.
They were unable to complete their calls, and they only once managed to open half the locals, so this should be a wake-up to the Rangers who are now in the middle of a division.
Erdogan receives blind receptions in Cologne
It was a smile and bright sky on Saturday (29 September), when Turkey’s and Germany’s leaders met with breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan’s visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the two NATOs.
There have been differences between them due to issues such as human rights, freedom of the media and the entry of Turkey into the European Union.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to most Turkish residents outside Turkey itself.
The police used security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosquito, but a number of supporters could be around her to see their president.
The Protestant hundreds against Erdogan, many of them Kurdar, also heard and condemned both the policy of Erdogan and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
The two protestor groups reflect the controversialness of this guest, who is hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and hated by others.
Deepford conflict: A jockey killed himself fighting a car
A jockey killed his life in a car in London.
The conflict was near the intersections of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a wide street in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, about 10.15 C.E., at a British local time.
The car driver stopped, and the medical personnel suffered relief, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The conflict occurred a few months after another rider died in a collision where a driver drove off on Childers Street, 1.5 km from Saturday’s accident site.
The police said that she was working to identify the man and let his closest residents know.
The road is shut down and directs another bus ride, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards wounded in riots
Six prison guards were injured when riots broke out in prison for men, according to a report from the prison office.
In the Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire about 9.30 p.m., the riots broke out at British local time on Sunday, and they still go.
The “Tornodo” Special Forces have been called to the area to try to control the riots, which eight prisoners are incarcerated, and are only in one cell of the prison.
The guards suffered a minor injury to a face at the scene.
A spokesman for the National Institute of Prisons said: “Scientified prison guards have been called out to handle cases that are taking place in Long Lartin prison.
Six employees have been treated for injury.
There is no violence in our prisons, and we state clearly that the responsible men will be handed over to the police and may expect to spend even more time behind the lock and strike."
Over 500 prisoners sit in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the warden had to go to the hospital after a prisoner attacked him.
And in October of last year, the riot police were called on to deal with a serious disturbance of peace, which attacked a billiard - ball staff.
The hurricane Rosa threats Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with rapid reaction (dried areas could benefit from)
It is rare for tropical regions to cross Arizona, but it is likely that early next week, when the remainder of hurricane rosa passes over the southwest, it will be early in the week.
The National Weather Agency has already issued warnings in response to sudden attacks by Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and western Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is estimated that Rose will cross Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive late on Monday with rainfall.
The Phoenix Weather Service stated on Twitter that “only ten hurricanes have achieved strength to be classified as tropical storms or regions within a distance of less than 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 64 km away from the Arizona border."
The last prediction from the hurricane center of the country predicts 5-10 cm of precipitation, with isolated rainfall up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest, including the middle of the Mountains and the Great Physician (The Great Basin), there is likely to be 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with the possibility of a single result up to 10 cm.
For those who are not at risk of rapid landing, Rosu’s offspring may be a blessing because there is a great deal of drought in the area.
Although a flood can cause great damage, some of this waste will have a positive effect, as drought is now in the southwest.
According to U.S. drought monitoring, there is at least a very high drought to over 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second highest group," according to reports fromweather.com.
First, the hurricane Rosa will land in the Gulf of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosos was still categorized as hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind concentration of 136 km per hour and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and travels north at 19 km per hour.
The storm crosses the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean and reduces its power.
Thus, it is expected to land in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday or Monday evening.
In some areas of Mexico, there is a potential for great rainfall, with a significant risk of flooding.
“It’s possible to get up to 7.5 to 15 cm in Baja California and into the northwest of Sonora, with a possibility of up to 25 cm of rainfall,” said a report fromweather.com.
Rosos will then go north over Mexico as a tropical storm, and then reach the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical region, and then she will continue through Arizona and arrive at southern Utah late on Tuesday evening.
“The greatest threat expected from Rosa or its remains is a very high rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and southwest of the U.S. desert area,” said the hurricane center of the country.
This rainfall is expected to cause life - threatening rapids and movements in the deserts, and it is expected to creep into the mountains.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
A three - year - old and 20 - year - old man has been arrested for attempted murder, after a 16 - year - old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, about 4:00 p.m. to British local time on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital where his condition is said to be “stabilized. ”
One 17 - year - old boy, two 18 - year - olds, and one 20 - year - olds were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The police have been waiting for a witness who could have recorded a phone call for what happened.
Trump says that Kavanaugh “was able to feel evil and anger ” from the Democrats
“Measure in support of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the ruthless and disgraceful methods of the Democratic Party,” said Trump for a meeting with supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was “getting to feel the evil and the wrath ” of the Democrats throughout his process of denial.
Kavanaugh witnessed to the council on Thursday, where he hardened the charges from Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually harassed her several decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also bore witness before the committee about his accusations.
The president said on Saturday that “Americans had seen genius and humanity and courage ” Kavanaugh the other day.
“A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote which confirms one of the most clever lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a magnificent CV as a public official,” he said to the group of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president made an indirect reference to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke of the importance of the Republican supporters taking part in the mid-term conferences.
“ There are five weeks in one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't volunteer, but I do it really," he said.
“ That is why I go around the field to fight for great candidates. ”
Trump claimed that Democrats are working on “thirsty and abstinence. ”
The first key vote on the Office’s floor on Kavanaugh’s nomination is to take place no later than Friday, according to the assistant of the leaders of the Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican government.
Hundreds died from earthquakes and flooding in Indonesia, and it is likely that the number of dead will rise.
At least 384 died, and many were swept away as a vast century came upon the shores, when a great earthquake and a flood struck over the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on the beach in Pala on Friday, when as many as six feet [6 m] tall centuries passed on the beach at sunset, many people washed out at sea and destroyed everything they had done.
The wave was formed after an earthquake of 7.5 points on Richter.
“ At the time of the flood waves yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they died,” said Suttopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for a disaster agency in Indonesia, at an information meeting in Jakarta.
“ The wave didn’t come alone, she pulled cars, a tree scrub, a house, she hit everything on the land, ” said Nugroho, adding that the wave had traveled over the open ocean at 800 miles [800 km] before she ran to the beach.
Some climbed into a tree to escape the tide and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were moved to 24 centers in Pala.
A number of damaged buildings and shops, twisted and useless bridges and mosques were shown by the apocalypse.
After-storms continued riding over the beach city on Saturday.
The order of earthquakes was seen in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia’s establishment of food and technology, stated in a declaration that the hurricane released from the heavy quake on Friday had been about 200 times greater than the atom bomb that fell on Hiroshima city in World War II.
The city’s geographic location at the end of a long and narrow flea may have increased the volume of the flood, said the Institute.
Nugroho said the damage was “real” and that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls, and hotels had collapsed.
Like some victims, he said that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the loss and damage to property could be greater along the 300 km north coast line from Pala, in an area called Donggala, nearer to the noise of the earthquake.
“Communicating completely down and no information coming ” from Donggala, said Nugroho.
“Over 300,000 people live there,” said the Red Cross in a declaration, adding that their employees and volunteers were on their way to that area.
“ This is already a tragedy, but it may be much worse, ” said the Red Cross.
The Agency was criticized by many on Saturday for not telling because a flood wave had washed Pala, although public representatives said that the waves had arrived within the time of the warning.
In a video published on the social media, a person could hear shouting from the upper level of buildings to warn the people on the street below that a flood wave was approaching.
Just minutes later, the river wave strikes on the beach, carrying out buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the video immediately.
The earthquake and the flood wave caused lack of electricity, which prevented communication with Pala and made it difficult for the authorities to organize relief work.
The army has begun sending aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but people who have been helped by the area still need food and other necessities.
The city airport has only been reopened for rescue operations and will be closed in October.
Mr. Joko Widodo, President of the United States, is going to visit refugee centres in Pala on Sunday.
The number of the dead is over 800 after a flood wave in Indonesia.
Things are very bad.
The People of World Vision from Donggala have reached the city of Pala, where they seek refuge in tent cities set up in the park outside their offices.
“ People said they saw many houses completely destroyed, ” he said.
Things are very bad.
Helpers have started a difficult relief work, but some have complained that foreign workers with high expertise were prevented from traveling to Pala.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only begin to arrive if the disaster area is declared a disaster area.
It hasn't been done yet.
“ It’s still a local disaster area,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman of the Indian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared this a disaster area, we can open up foreign aid, but no statement has yet been made."
When the second night fell upon Pala after the earthquake and the Flood on Friday, friends and their families, hoping that their loved ones would be one of the miraculous stories that cast hope on the devastating headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from the gutter.
On Sunday, the relief workers of a woman who had been trapped under ruins for two days with her mother’s body by her side.
Gendon Subandoo, a coach of the Indonesian ashtray team, had been the coach of two now missing squids for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mr. Monday.
“ As a man with a long experience in hovering, I have my own emotional burden to bear,” he said.
Mr. Gendon reported that the hour after news was received within the flight crew because the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he had sent WhatsApp messages in despair to the contestants who stayed in Pala and participated in the beach festival.
His message, however, showed only a gray mark, instead of a blue one.
“I think that means the message wasn’t received,” he said.
Thicks steal $26.750 when they fill up a fast bank in Newport on the Live
On Friday morning, the thieves took $26.750 from Brink's employee, who was filling in a fast bank in Newport on the Level, as reported by the Newport Police.
The driver of the car had been emptying fast banks in the entertainment area and was about to fill more money on him, said Dennis McCarthy, police officer, in the announcement.
When he was working, another man “came behind the Brink employee ” and stole a money bag for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects fleeing the scene, according to the announcement, but the police did not give up how many people were involved.
Those who might have information about the suspects are asked to contact Newport Police on the 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West is going to change his name--to Ye.
He announced the Twitter change on Saturday, and he wrote: “The creature previously known as Kanye West. ”
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time, using the name as the title of his eighth album that came out in June.
The change occurs for his participation in the Saturn Night Live factor where he is expected to report his new album, Yandhi.
He replaced the Ariana Grandi in the show, but for “emotional reasons, ” said the manufacturer.
West has previously said that this name has religious meaning for him, but it is also short on his present name.
“ I believe that “ye” (you) is the most common word in the Bible, and the Bible means “you,” said West earlier in the year when he spoke his name on the record with the radio director Big Boy.
“ So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It happened from Kanye, which means the only one, and into just Ye--to be just a reflection of the good in us, the evil, the confused, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are."
He is one of many famous buds that have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former associate of West, has also written his name with and without band and uppercase.
The President of Mexico vows not to use the military against ordinary citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against common cities, now the country will soon remember the 50th anniversary of the bloody vengeful campaign of vengeance for students.
Saturday at Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised “to never use the army to blackmail the Mexican people. ”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot at a peaceful protest march in the public square, killing up to 300 people at a time when the students’ left - winged movements were taking root all over Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico by giving all students monthly strength and opening up more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of learning opportunities attract young people to gangs of criminals.
The United States should double the funding for artificial intelligence
Now that China is ever more active in the use of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the funding it spends on research in that field, says the inventor and artificialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statements were made after various U.S. government departments published reports of artificial intelligence, even though the United States has no formal comprehensive programme of artificial intelligence.
On the other hand, China announced its plan last year: the aim is to be first-placed with artificial intelligence by 2030.
“It would be a good start to double the amount of money spent on artificial intelligence research, compared to the fact that all other countries are so much further behind the United States, and we are waiting to see the next major discovery in the field of artificial intelligence,” said Lee.
Doubleing funding could double the chance that the next major discovery of artificial intelligence will be made in the United States, said Lee to the CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, ” published this month by the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director of the company Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in Face++, one of the most important artificial companies in China.
He worked on a satellite system in the '90s at Carnegie Mellon University, which won the best U.S. player in Othello, and later he was the manager of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee spoke of previous technological competitions held by the U.S. authorities, such as the defense robot race, and asked when the next race would be held to identify the next jungle.
Scientists in the United States often have to work hard to gain strength from the government, says Lee.
“ It’s not China that grabs the most important ideas, but the companies,” said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired geniuses from colleges to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen its escalating research.
“I think those who have doctoral degrees in artificial intelligence should be allowed to stay automatically,” he said.
China’s Congress published its future programme in July 2017.
China’s Natural Science Institute provides money to people working at universities, similar to the National Science Foundation and similar public institutions in the United States, but the quality of science is worse in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defence Ministry set up an artificial intelligence centre, designed to cooperate with both industry and educational institutions, and the White House reported on the formation of a special advisory committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it invests over $100 million annually in artificial studies.
At the same time, U.S. law, which was designed to provide artificial intelligence security, has not been passed for months.
The Macedonians vote in a national resolution on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia chose a national vote on Sunday about whether the country’s name should be changed into “North Macedonia’s Republic” in an effort to resolve decades of conflict with Greece, which has closed their application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that their neighbor’s name to the north equals the requirement for their territory and so refuses them entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name, but patriotic opponents claim that the change will undermine the identity of the majority of the people of Macedonia of Slavic background.
Gjorge Ivanov, President of the United States, has said that he will not participate in the vote, and a campaign to ignore it has raised doubts that participation will reach the 50 - percent minimum required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the electoral code is this: “Do you want to walk in NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?”
Supportors of the name change, including Mr Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister, say that this is a fair price for Macedonia for membership of the EU and NATO, one of the countries that was created after Yugoslavia’s fall.
“I came today to choose the future of the country for the young people of Macedonia so that it can live free under EU protection because it means safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result is not legally binding, enough senators have said that they will apply it and bind it into law.
The change in the name would require the approval of two thirds of the council.
The campaign committee said that nothing unusual had been reported at 1 p.m.
However, the participation rate was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent of the number of votes cast in 2016, when 66 per cent of the voters registered voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62 - year - old voter in the capital city of Skopje.
The prime minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko gave their vote in the Macedonian National Resolution on whether to change the country’s name, which would make it easier for them to enter NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the council in Skopje, 54 - year - old Vladimir Kavardarkov worked to prepare a small field and set up chairs in front of tents that had been built by those who will ignore the vote.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to become members with our heads high, do not go through the door of service,” said Kavardarkov.
“ We are a poor land, but we dwell in dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn elsewhere like China or Russia and become part of the Eurasian relationship."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO will provide the necessary funding to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is above 20 percent.
“I believe that the vast majority will approve that more than 80 percent of the population are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after paying their vote.
He said that approval would be “a key element in our future. ”
A survey published on Monday from the Macedonian Policy Research Office showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the national vote, which is lower than the minimum required.
Another TV poll showed that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would say yes.
So that the national vote is considered valid, saturation needs to be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote is not accepted, it could translate the first serious attack on the government policy, which is a member of the Western European Union, since it took place last May.
See: Sergio Aguero, player Manchester City, goes through all Brighton defenses and scorers
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling easily took the defense of Brighton in the victory of Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculous when he scored his goal in a 65th minute.
The Argentine army received a shipment at the center of the sphere at the beginning of the parish.
He jumped past three defenders of Brighton and then went out to the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green - dressed defenders.
He came by one of the defenders and then ran away from a few more just to Brighton's vat.
Then he sent to the left, and found Sterling there.
The English army used the first contact within the vanguard to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to play on Mathew Ryan, the markman Brighton, with a shot on the right side of the target.
“Aguero has some foot problems,” said President City, Pep Guardiola, reporting to reporters.
“ We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then that happened.
We were lucky he scored at this moment."
But it was Sterling who gave them the blue first goal of the election game.
That goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received a shipment deep in Brighton's valley half in that parish.
He sent a magnificent long ball to the left of Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball a couple of times and then sent Sterling to the far bar.
City's advance sent the ball to the net just before it ran out.
City will meet Hoffenheim in the Masters' Department at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a show against Rockies
Since the Nationals have been excluded from playing the finals, there was little reason to force a second start.
But the zealous Scherzer hopes to throw on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have the chance to get to the finish, but they have one play ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the West.
Rockies received at least a wildcard seat with their 5-2 victory at Nationals on Friday night, but the team still sought to reach their first party.
“ Even if we play for free, we can at least play for an electric - must - be atmosphere in Denver, as well as for the rest of the team, certainly after playing our best game this year.
Why should I not want to compete in such a situation?"
Nationals still have to announce who will be the first thrower in Sunday’s game, but they are expected to have Scherzer throw at these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was about to play for the 34th time, took a practice session on Thursday and would throw on a Sunday which is usually his Sabbath.
The right-hand pitcher for Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 winds in 220 2/3 cycles of this season.
Trump visits West Virginia
The president referred directly to the case around Kavanaugh, a designated Supreme Court judge when he spoke of the importance of supporting the Republicans taking part in the mid-term conferences.
“ Everything is at stake in November.
It's five weeks in one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the big, big... I don't volunteer, but I do, which is why I'm going around the field to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say: “You can see this terrible, radical group of democrats, you can see it happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by whatever means, you see the cruelty, the evil.
They don't care who they hurt, over who they have to go to take over and control, they just want power and control, we don't give them that.
He said that Democrats are working “to silence and to prevent. ”
“ And it has been seen in the last four days, ” he said, saying the Democrats are “sacrifice and evil and cruel and untrue. ”
He referred to the senator Diane Feinstein, the dominant democrat of the Senate Committee, as a member of the Senate Committee, and was answered with a loud bell from the audience.
“ Do you remember her answer?
Were you the one who picked up the document?
Ha, what?
No, look, I waited for one... it was really bad body language, the worst I've seen."
The working class is no longer a tolerant church.
He cannot tolerate those who express their feelings
When my operative Momentum chose to give me instructions, it was hardly surprising.
After all, I am the lateest of many union members who have been told that we are not welcome, just for expressing our mind.
Joan, my fellow worker, received similar treatment, for she strongly opposed prejudice against the Jews.
In my case, there was the suggestion to give me recommendations because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues were the importance of having responsible economic policies, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues, and Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting for Nottingham East on Friday said that “we want the meetings to understand nothing out and be effective. ”
In my eight - year career as a laborer’s congressman, Friday meetings have most often been exactly that.
Regrettably, this is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of a “milder and better ” policy has been forgotten, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions are not passed in the Workers’ Party and that all opinions are judged by whether the leaders of the group consider them acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues, whom I thought earlier, had similar political views to me, began to expect me to take full conversion and supported opinions that I had never agreed before, whether it was on national security or on the common EU market area.
Every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't matter what I say - it follows the demeanors of community media that are called after my expulsion, central politics denied, and I say that I shouldn't be a member of the Workers' Party.
And this isn't just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, since most of the comments I get to me are usually political.
I admire the professionalness and determination of those who have to endure the holocaust of sexual or prejudiced insults every day but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing things in this political period is how attacks and insults have become a natural part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labor Team should be concerned with a toleranceary culture.
The reality is that we are no longer tolerant of the church, and with every mistrust or change in the rules of choice the class becomes ever tighter.
For the last two years, I have been counseled not to be too loud, and then I would be “all right. ”
But I did not decide to take part in politics to do so.
Since I became a member of the Workers' Party as a student 32 years ago, encouraged by the neglect of the government of Thatcher, who left my schoolroom in decay, I have fought for better public service for those who need it most, whether in the government or in a parliament.
I have never entrusted my political beliefs, nor with my last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my policy decisions and where I disagree with the current leaders.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would just like to say that when the country is heading for Brexit, which will damage homes, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy in my loyalty to the leaders of the working party.
But my only message that I would like to send from me is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to those who are within my choosing, whether they are members of the Task Force or not: I serve you proudly, and I promise that no threats of deviation or political expulsion will hold me back from doing what I believe to be for the best of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr team goes to the top
Two late touchdowns may have damaged the final result something, but there is no doubt that Ayr had the victory separated in this early playing of the day in the Tennent's Premiership division.
They are now at the top of the list, and one out of ten people who are still undefiled.
Finally, it was a stronger protection and a better use of opportunities that made the locals more victorious, and Coach Peter Murchie had the right to be content.
“We’ve had a tough opposition in our games so far and are still undefeated, so I must be happy, ” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Aur is to be commended; they took advantage of their opportunity better than we, ”
Mark Grant Anderson came Ayr over in the 14th minute after Frazier Climo turned the call on, but a yellow card on the Scottish captain, who was allowed to play the game with Warriors, enabled Melrose to let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot reached the mark of touch.
Climo increased Ayr’s leadership with hell before kicking just before halftime, followed by a touchdown, and Ayr went over 17-5 in halftime.
However, after Baggot turned his approach, a second half of the power and touch mark of Patrick Anderson reduced the margin to five points.
Then it took a long break to find a serious injury at Ruaridh Knottt, who had to be carried off the playground, and thereafter, Ayr still increased his leadership with a touchdown from Stafford McDowall, after Climo turned the search on.
Blair Macherson, chief of Ayr, then got the yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of being a man over with a touchdown from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a hard search.
The locals, on the other hand, recovered strongly, and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for using Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind the Ayr attack, after an extra ride.
Climo turned the search back, as he did again immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe reached the kick of David Amrstrong from the Wing and sent to Gregor Henry, who scored the fifth touchdown of the team.
Starring The Still Game of the Factors Ready for a new career in the restaurant
The Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game episode, seems ready to move to a restaurant dispute after he found out he was hired the manager of a restaurant company.
Kieran, age 56, plays the popular Jack Jarvis of the BBC, which he writes and plays with his old partner from the entertainment business, Creg Hemphil.
The double has announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last one, and so seems Kiernan has plans for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the Director General of Operation Morn Limited.
The actor wanted nothing to say about the story, but according to Scottish Sun, Kiernan wanted to be a participant in the “living restaurant family ” of Glasgow.
“Hope is ours ”: Bolivia’s beachless land hopes that the court will open the way back to the Pacific
Sailors guard the fleet headquarters in La Paz.
General buildings flag a blue flag.
Watering stations from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are marked with the slogan: “We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to regain it."
On the other hand, many of the landlocked Bolivia’s memory of the shoreline, lost to Chile in bloody conflicts in the 19th century, still in fresh memory — along with the desire to sail the Pacific once again.
These hopes may be the strongest for decades, now that Bolivia is awaiting a decision from the International Court of Justice in The Hague on October 1, after five years of speaking.
“Bolivia has the power, the spirit of unity, and the unbridled spirit, and, of course, is waiting for the decision with a positive heart,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many people in Bolivia will be watching the International Court’s decision on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court will rule out Bolivia’s claim that Chile is obliged to provide Bolivia with access after decades of difficult conversations.
Monday’s decision is also of great importance to Evo Morales, the president of the country’s Indian family, who will be engaged in a controversial campaign for secondment next year.
“ We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he promised in late August.
However, some analysts are unlikely to consider Bolivia’s decision to be in favour of the Court, and that if he did so, it would not change much.
The Court of Justice, which has headquarters in the Netherlands, has no authority to give a land from Chile and has determined that the decision will not affect the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the Court comes only six months after the closing talks had been heard indicates that the matter “had not been complicated,” said Paz Sárate, a secular expert in international law.
It is also possible that in the past four years, not the Bolivian language, but the country’s return.
“ The current Bolivian government has stolen the issue of access to the sea, ” said Zárate.
Morales’ words have displeased all favors of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations sometime, but it will be enormously difficult after this.
From 1962 onward, the two countries have not exchanged with ambassadors.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president of Bolivia, and representative of the country in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court’s decision took an unusual short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “a unique opportunity to open up a new relationship with Chile, ” and he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, another of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using this issue as a political crutch.
“ Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean, ” he added.
“ It is an opportunity to see that we need to recover in the past. ”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, Foreign Secretary of North Korea says that the country will never take down its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Rí gave his speech on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called upon the United States to follow the promises they made at a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
His remarks are now being made by Mike Pompeo, U.S. Foreign Secretary, who appears to be at the end of the talks on nuclear weapons again, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea.
Rí says that it is “dreams ” to believe that continued business prayers and protests by the United States against the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever touch North Korea.
Washington will not accept the declaration unless Pyongyang takes first clear action to take down his nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, President of the United States, want to meet again at another meeting.
However, there are great doubts that Pyongyang is serious about taking down weapons that the country probably sees as the only way to secure security.
Pompeo estimates to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
A fashion show in Paris presents the latest line of large headsuits that will come in the fashion stores near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or be completely covered from the sun, you do not have to look any further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a wide range of strange hats in excess size for their SS19 line in the fashion field, which fascinated the jettulator at the fashion week in Paris.
The number of images of unhandled hats has been published on Instagram this summer, and these designers have had their recent creations for display in fashion shows.
The main work after Valentino was a big brown - light hat with large boards that resembled the feathers and covered the model’s head.
Of other supersized elements, watermelons could be seen set jewels, seamen's hats, and even pineapples, but these things are not designed to keep the temperature on your head.
Thom Browne also introduced a variety of strange masks, just at the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sumptuous lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One mask resembled a respirator with a respirator and glasses, while another resembled a melting ice cream in a form of bread.
If you want to fuck with the tiger, you're lucky.
The fashion experts predict that the big hats could soon be sold in fashion stores near you.
Large hats can be found on the heels of “La Bomba”, a straw hat with more than 60cm high loads that have adorned their heads from Rihanna to Emily Ratakowski.
The fashion mark behind the extremely impracticable hat that was seen on all the centers of society was the inspiration of another large complement that appeared on the fashion field — a straw - made beachbag that was almost as large as the swimweary model that carried it.
The orange stripe, with striped and white leather handle, was the main part of the La Riviera SS10 clothing line Jacquemus at the fashion week in Paris.
Luke Armitage, the styler of the famous people, said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags appear in fashion shops for the next summer - where the designer has caused so much impact should be difficult to ignore the demand for excesses. ”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
The special schools in Scotland are well-known for their students’ outstanding achievements and have continued in 2018 with new, stunning testing standards, which are still strengthened by individual and group success in sports, art, music, and other social practices.
These schools have up to 30,000 students all over Scotland, with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) defending them, and they strive to give their students and their parents the best possible service.
Individual schools aim to prepare their students for further study, the career they have chosen, and their place of residence as citizens of the world.
As teachers, who can assemble and study according to specially designed curriculumes, we can see that new issues continue to be popular subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in a language he understands, his mind will be touched.
If you speak with him in his mother tongue, it touches his heart."
This is an important reminder that we cannot just trust in English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s test results show that languages are at the top of the lists with the highest percentages of students who obtain tests in private schools.
68 percent of students learning a foreign language received A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of the students received the quality A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also received the grade A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support a foreign language that will no doubt need children and young people in the future.
At present, languages as a selection are placed in the same place as scientific subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in personal schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that for the reasons given by employers that it was difficult to recruit jobs, 17 percent was due to lack of language skills.
That is why language learning is becoming more and more important to prepare young people for their future work.
Now that more and more jobs require language skills, this ability is needed in a global world.
No matter what career people choose, they will have real prospects in the future if they learn another language, a knowledge that lasts their lives.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will give a multiplicity of persons an automatic headway on the competitive side.
According to a survey by YouGov of over 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent of them could not speak another language well enough to maintain conversation, and French was the only language spoken by two letters, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for children today to invest immediately in language teaching.
A number of young people, especially in new countries, will give children a better opportunity to find an important job.
In Scotland, the language they teach varies from school to school.
A certain number of schools will focus on classical new languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important to Britain in view of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interest lies, he or she will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with specialized teachers.
Schools are committed to offering a study environment that will prepare children and prepare them with the expertise they need to achieve success, no matter what the future holds for them.
There is no denying that, at this time, in a global business environment, language remains necessary for the future of the country, and it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern - day languages should really be viewed as “national skills in communication. ”
Private schools will continue to offer choice, variety, and superiority to the young people of Scotland.
I'm getting the bee le faire.

LeBron plays his first game for Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is soon over for fans who want to see LeBron James play their first game for the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Luke Walton, Laker's coach, has announced that James will play on Sunday in the opening game of the season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has not yet been decided in how many minutes he will play.
“ It will be longer than one minute and shorter than 48,” said Walton on Laker’s public site.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for Lakers, said on Twitter that James would probably play for a limited time.
After this week’s rehearsal, James was asked in his six - game Laker’s program before the start of the season.
“ During this period of my career, I don’t have to play games for the season to prepare, ” he said.
Timeout for Trump campaign meeting in West Virginia and YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a number of election meetings and the first one is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia State.
He is one of five organized meetings next week, where he will also stop at friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his election of a new Supreme Court judge has been suspended, Trumpjad will build support for the next mid-term election, as Republics are at risk of losing control of Congress when voting will be paid in November.
What time is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, and how can you watch him online?
The meeting of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 19:00 p.m. to the eastern time tonight, Saturday September 29th, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia on the Internet below through a live YouTube broadcast.
It is likely that Trump will conduct the trial of Brett Kavanaugh, a senior judge who was sued by the charges of sexual harassment, who was suspended for up to a week while the FBI investigates the charges.
However, the main goal of Trump’s meetings is to help the Republicans to make better living, but they are waiting for difficult elections in November.
Thus, the message from Trump’s campaign was that these five meetings, which will be held next week, aim to “fill volunteers and supporters with enthusiasm as the Republicans try to protect and add to the majority they have in the Senate and in Congress, ” according to Reuter’s news office.
“The President’s plan is so important to the council that he will travel to as many states and can already begin a busy campaign period,” said an unnamed spokesman from Trump’s campaign to Reuter’s news office.
The meeting tonight will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, and supporters are expected to come from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and that media from Pittsburgh tell about it,” according to West Virginia Metro News News.
Saturday’s meeting will be another visit of Trump to West Virginia this month, but he won with over 40 percent difference in this state in 2016.
Trump wants to try to help Patrick Morrissey, the candidate of the Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican, who is at the bottom of a poll.
“ Morrissey doesn’t know well that the president has to come and try to increase his popularity,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuter’s news office.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S.A. campaign to keep hope alive for the individual contest on Sunday
After three one - sided rings, the four - game last Saturday could be just what was needed in this race for the Ryder Cup.
Success swings are a sports concept that has been invented and which players truly believe in, and never more than in competitions like this.
Where would they say that success is now taking place?
“They had a six - point head start, and now it’s four points, so that success is rather our side now, I guess," said Jordan Spieth, as he set off in the race of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth said, think they have a little wind in the sails and they can be hopeful of many, especially the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and where received three points out of four.
Spieth has played a great game all the time, leading his example.
The cheer of gladness increased as the ring went down, and he put down important pieces of powder to shepherd all four stages of the game after he and Thomas had been two points under after two games.
His Puttt, which secured them the victory in the 15th hole game, suffered a similar shout of joy, a cry of the kind that tells you that he believes that the American people still have a hope for victory.
“ You just have to dive deep and think about your own game, ” said Spieth.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to win the level.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of Ryder.
This strange but fascinating European couple has won four out of four games and cannot do anything wrong.
“ Molwood” was the only couple who were given schooling on Saturday afternoon, but they also managed to avoid schooling on Saturday mornings, afternoons on Fridays, and nine holes on Friday mornings.
The game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the loud audiences clearly show that they are the couple who have to win on Sunday, and there would be no popular player to seal up the potential victory of the European team than the Fleetwood or Molinari, when the sun sets over the Le Golf National Field.
The best option would be for both of them to do so simultaneously in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson took Sergio Garcia easy, the hero of four in the morning, playing with Alex Noren.
In the first nine holes, a swallow and two doubles dug the Spanish and the Silver into a hole that they never got to scratch.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The four balls and the four games are so exciting to watch in person because of the communication between the couples, their advice, the advice they do not give, and how a game plan can change in a single form.
Europe has played better as a team up to now and has a significant lead by the end of the day, but this four - game party also showed that Americans have the struggle that some had doubted, especially other Americans.
Europe with 10-6 leader for the final day of the race for the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good start before the end of the day of the Ryder Cup after the four ball and the fourth Saturday, with the advantage of 10-6 against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over Tiger Woods, who were in trouble, and have received four points at the Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, who would love to win back the award cup, which it lost on the Hazeltine field two years ago, showed great superiority over the United States’s team in the quadruple of the morning and won 3-1.
The United States showed more resistance in the four games and won two games but failed to win the score.
Jim Furyk’s team needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to continue the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who played the nickname “Molliwood” after a wonderful weekend, are only the second couple who win four points from their first four games in Ryder’s history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four - ball game, they showed a great deal of strength and won Wood's shutdown and U.S. freshman Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed his genius a few times, but he has now lost 19 of 29 plays in four balls and fours and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who was spent for the four-ball game of the morning, came back to his partner, Henrik Stenson, in the four-games, and won the 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are at first and third place on the list of the best golfers in the world.
On that mild and steamy day, southwest of Paris, however, Europe did not benefit all.
A triple winner in the big golf race, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, set the goal for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They worked with difficulty 2-1 against Jon Rahm from Spain and Ian Poulter in four ball games and later came back and won Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the four games after losing the first two holes.
It has only occurred twice in Ryder’s history that the team worked up four points in the beginning of the individual race, although Fury’s team needed only a draw to continue the cup.
After two days, however, it seems that Sunday’s counterattack will overwhelm them.
North Korea says one-sided dearmament “incapable” without confidence
On Saturday, the U.S. Foreign Secretary of the United States told the United States that continued business prayer only made sense in the United States and it would be impossible for the country to take down its nuclear weapons alone under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said in the UN Annual General Assembly that North Korea had resorted to “a considerable measure of goodwill” in the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, reducing the nuclear testing area, and promising to risk nuclear and nuclear development.
“ However, we have not seen any equivalent response from the United States, ” he said.
“ Without confidence in the United States, there is no evidence of the security of our country, and under such circumstances it is impossible that we take down our nuclear weapons first alone."
Although Ri has repeated familiar North-Korean complaints of opposition to Washington at the “speedier” approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded for every step it would take, his statement seemed special to the extent that he did not deny single-sided nuclear disarmament cleanly as Pyongyang had done in the past.
A reference to the joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump on the first meeting between Presidents of the United States and Head of North-Korean, in Singapore, on 12 June, where Kim promised to work on “the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump announced promises to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea has sought solutions to the formal end of the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must leave its nuclear weapons behind first.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the proliferation of business orders against North Korea.
“The United States demands that “nuclear disarmament take place first” and increase pressure by using business prayers to accomplish its mission, even protesting the declaration to end the war,” said Ri.
“ There are only fantasies of people who know nothing about us to think that business prayer can put us on our knees.
But the problem is that continued business prayer increases our confidence."
There was no mention of plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump, the leader of the U.S.A., mentioned earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister spoke about three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, leader of South Korea over the past five months, adding: “If this nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea instead of the United States, this position on nuclear disarmament in the Korean Republic would not be this position. ”
In spite of this, Ri’s speech was very different from his speech last year when he said to the General Assembly of the United States that it would be inevitable to direct rockets from North Korea to the mainland of the United States after “the Devil - speaking president” Trump called Kim a “fireball man” in a suicide mission.
In the previous year, Trump threatened to “work out" North Korea, but this year he praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that there was still much work to be done and that the business prayer had to continue until North Korea had destroyed all its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame for this, saying: “If this takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia say that the U.S. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, Mike Pompeo, U.S. Foreign Secretary, at the U.S. Security Council on Thursday, said: “The Security Council's request must continue to apply until the full nuclear disarmament has taken place and it must be confirmed. ”
The Security Council agreed to increase business requests for North Korea from 2006 to close funding for Pyongyang nuclear and missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline of the U.S. General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that success had been achieved, but only a few hours later he condemned North Korea for making “bad demands. ”
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to take down the missile zone and nuclear station if the United States were to take “equivalent action.”
He said that Kim had told himself that the “equivalent actions ” he was looking for were insurance for security that Trump promised in Singapur and measures toward normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses in sufficient rest
A new university course in Harvard has given all students more sleep in an effort to counteract the growing tendency of students to stay awake and learn all night with the help of caffeine tablets.
A study revealed that students of the world’s best university often know little or nothing when it comes to basic thinking about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical School and expert at Brigham and the women’s hospital, designed the course and believes that it sees its first species in the United States.
He had the idea of doing the course after giving a lecture on the effects of lack of sleep on learning ability.
“ At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and asked: “Why is this first said to me, in my final year? ”
She said that no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he said to the telegraph.
The first - time course of this year explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help study ability and performance in sports and even promote general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of mental health care at Harvard Medical School and the director of health care at the school, said that the university decided to present the course after learning that the students were very sleepless over the week.
The course is an hour in length and involves a number of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a room in your home, where students hit a cup of coffee, curtains, sports shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sports performance can worsen with lack of sleep, as well as the importance of a good night’s routine at night.
In the second part, participants are told how long - term lack of sleep may increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Maps of the school area with interactive signs then encourage participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“ We know that this will not change student behavior immediately.
But we feel that they are entitled to know this, just as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that favors those who stay awake and learn all night is still there, he said, and added that today’s technology and increased pressure on students meant that lack of sleep was a growing problem.
The security of getting enough sleep of good quality should be “the secret weapon” of the students to resist stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said — even to avoid getting fat, as lack of sleep increases the urge of the brain for food so that the body is ever hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in chemistry and physics from California, helped Professor Czeisler put together the course, one of the professor’s cows last year during his first year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a course for all students at school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduates to complete a similar course before they start studying at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm clock, which reminds them of going to sleep, and to awaken them, and keep in mind the damaging effects of blue light given by electronic screens and LED light, which can confuse the internal clock of the body and cause trouble to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark from Menga clouds down Gerrard's men
Rangers still had troubles in the field, breaking Stevens Gerrard's team had to accept 1-0 losses on Livingston, after a goal from Dolly Menga.
Ibrox wanted to win his first victory in the field after his victory at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrand's only his second loss in his 18 plays as the manager.
Menga scored seven minutes before half a game, and the Ranger’s team seemed to lack all inspiration and was never likely to match.
Rangers are now falling down to the sixth place, but Livingston goes up to the third and is only following Hibernia in goal difference.
Rangers might have a further problem after lineman Calum Spence had to suffer a head injury after some object was thrown into him from the turnip of the visitors.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr away and came in the first place in the Bethfred Cup.
Holt, however, stuck to the same Life 11 installation that reached a stage of Hearts last week and he would have been pleased with how well - trained his fellows became over the Resistance.
Rangers might have been more with the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the ball it reached.
They should have scored only two minutes after the start of the game when the first shipment from Menga came Scott Pitman in front of Allan McGregors, who shot by.
A long exorcism from Keaghan Jacobs then ended up with Craig Halkett, while Alan Lithgow, his defense partner, shot past the outpost.
The Rangers again mastered the game but seemed to live in hope rather than faith in their game at the end of the game.
Alfredo Morales certainly felt he should have had a hell of a time when a quarter was past the game, when he and Steven Lawless came together but the judge Steven Thomson referred to the Colombian’s appeal.
The Rangers only took two shots at the first half while Liam Kelly, former leader of Ibrox, did not need to have much to protect Lassana Coulibaly shells and an easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although an opportunity from Livi in a 34 - minute period had occurred despite the fact that the other had passed the hand, no one can deny that they deserved it, but only because of their persistence.
Rangers again failed to do anything from Jacobs' long extra job.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who held his calm and chose to send to Menga, who then scored easily.
Gerrard took counsel in half and sent Ryan Kent into place of Coulibaly, and the replacements had an effect almost immediately upon the porter’s arrival of Morelos, while Kelly quickly reacted and ran forward to close the shot.
Livingston, however, continued nurturing the guests to play just the type of game they enjoy playing, and Lithgow and Halkett reached each long shipment after another.
The way Holts could have increased their leadership on the locamines, but McGregor did well to deny Jacobs an opportunity before Lithgow ran to a goal from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, Ranger's keeper, wanted another hell when he and Jacobs fell down together, but Thomson referred it back to him.
Almanak: The man who invented the Geiger counter
Here is a magazine from our calendar “Sunday Morning ”: September 30, 1882, and ÁFRAM... this is the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of studying and measuring radioactivity, and that invention eventually led to a device called Geiger’s measurements.
The Geiger measurement has gained a permanent place in the scientific world since then but was also popular in pop culture, for example in the 1950 "Bells of Coronado" movie, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in different roles as scientists:
Man: “What on earth is this? ”
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s measurement, used to find radioactive matter such as uranium.
When you put on these earpieces, you can hear the effects from the atoms due to radioactivity in the stones."
Evans: “It really breaks now! ”
“ His ” Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can cause your immune system to “see” dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of the treatment
Treatment includes taking immune cells from the patient and changing them to a laboratory
They can then “see” proteins, which are common in many cancer cells, and are then injected back into the patient
Experimental studies have shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months and the vaccine teaches immune cells to recognise dangerous cancer cells.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and turning them into a laboratory so that they can see a protein called HER2 and are found in many types of cancer, and then the cells are injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the United States Cancer Institute, Bethesday, Maryland, said: “Our findings indicate that the vaccine is very effective. ”
HER2 “makes various types of cancer stop growing, ” including breast, ovarian, lung, and rectum cancer, said Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure in which immune cells are taken from patients and the ‘known’ attack on cancer cells has been effective in the treatment of one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held a long conversation in support of Trump and carried MAGA derhufu after appearing on the TV program SNL.
It didn't end well
In the studio in Saturday Night Live, Kanye West was awarded a long - term talk in which he commended President Donald Trump of the United States and said that he would present himself to president by 2020.
After moving the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, where he carried the Make America Great Derhufu, he long spoke against the democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
“ I have so often talked to white people who say, ‘ How can you like Trump, he's a racist? ’
If I were worried about racial hatred, I would be moved from the United States long ago," he said.
The SNL began with a stoop where Hollywood star Matt Damon made fun of the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the grounds of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although West's long-losts were not sent out, her recording was placed on a community medium by Chris Rock's comedian.
It's not certain if Rock wanted to make fun of West by publishing the tape.
Also, West had complained to the audience that he had received bad backstage receptions because of his hat choice.
“ I was placed in a rearrange monogamous area.
They said to me: “Do not go up to the field with this cap. ”
They set me up!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, according to the reports of Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the deep hole? ” He said that he would put on his superhero robe,“ because that means you can’t order me for work, do you want the world to make progress?
Try love."
His comments were received by a bean from the audience at least twice, and SNL actors seemed to have a short time, according to Variety, and one person said to the paper: “There was a silence in the studio. ”
West had been invited to attend instead of the singer Arianau Grande, whose boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his appearance as he sang the song I Love it, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from Candace Turner, president of the conservative group TPUSA, who said on Twitter: “To one of the bravest souls: THANK FOR EXCHANGE MOST. ”
But Karen Hunter, a chatist on Twitter, said that West was simply being “he himself and that’s just wonderful. ”
“ But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his “list ”) who I feel is supporting and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So are we," she added.
The Twitter rapper announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now “the creature that was formerly known as Kanye West. ”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion and cannot be forgotten about the musical myth of Prince’s vow, which changed his name in symbol and later called himself the artist who was formerly known as Prince.

Kit Harington, the star of the Crown Games, criticizes poisonous manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent adventures of HBO, the Crown Games.
The 31 - year - old player, however, has criticized the male hero stereotype and says that such a role on the screen means that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to gain respect.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes that “something has gone wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood during the #MeToo period.
Kit, who recently married his wife - in - law from the Crown Games, the 31 - year - old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had “strong opinions ” on how to deal with this issue.
“ I personally feel at the moment — what has gone wrong with the masculinity? ”
“ What have we taught men about the problems we now see? ”
Kit believes that TV is partly responsible for increasing the toxicity of manhood, because of a very male person on TV.
He continued: “What is born, and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets that make young boys feel like they must be certain of a man?
I think it's one of the most important questions of the day--how do we do this?
Because it's obvious that something has gone wrong with young men."
He also admitted during the interview that he would not play any other Creatures after the series resembles the next summer and said that he had received “a lot of warfields and horses. ”
As of November, Kit will play in the reconstruction of True West, a picture by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a filmmaker and his kidnapped brother.
The player recently said that the best thing about having played at the Crown Games was to have met his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife in these things, so that they would give me my future family and my life thereafter,” he said.
Rose played Yritte, Jon Snow's lover, who Kit played in these Emmy Awards.
The couple married in June 2018 on the land of the Lesliar family in Scotland.
HIV/ AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of HIV-infected or AIDS infected citizens.
The health authorities say that over 820,000 people are infected in the country.
Some 40,000 new infections were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new infections were sexually transmitted, a change from one day to the next.
In the past, the HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to donors of infected blood.
On the other hand, as Chinese healthcare professionals said at a conference in Yunnan region, the number of HIV infected in this way has fallen to almost zero.
However, the number of people infected with HIV or AIDS has increased by about 100,000 people from year to year.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but there is still much discrimination against LGBT people.
Because of conservative national values, research has estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other people will finally marry a woman.
Many infections are caused by inadequate contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, China’s government has promised access to HIV medicines as part of a plan to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member has leaked data from the Congressional Councils of Republic of Republic of Republic of Republic, criticizing “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Maxine Waters, a senator, denied on Saturday that one of her employees had published the personal information of three Senators of the Republican Republican Party on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrats from Los Angeles said that these statements came from “superright - minded ” extremists and Web sites.
“ Lies, lies, and other pathetic lies, ” said Waters in a declaration on Twitter.
According to the addresses and phone numbers of the U.S. congressmen Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of them from Utah.
The information was published on the Internet on Thursday from an unknown party on Capitol Hill during the hearings at the Senate of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court's office, on the grounds of sexual harassment.
The search came sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Sustainant pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said that the IP numbers as the identifier of the information source were connected to the Waters office and published information on one of her employees, based on the data provided by Capitol Hill.
“ This unspeakable accusation is totally wrong and pure lies,” Waters continued.
“ My employer - what personal information and security are now in danger because of these false accusations - was in no way responsible for this information leak.
This unfounded accusation is absolutely false and pure lies."
Water’s statement was quickly criticised on the Internet, including the former White House reporter Ara Fleischer.
“ This denial is full of anger, ” wrote Fleischer.
“ This indicates that she does not have the strength to sit on a chair.
When a person is accused for no reason, do not react with anger.
It must not be opposed.
You can’t ask questions about what accuses you.
It must be quiet and overwhelmed."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticisms of Judge Kavanaugh, who the critics said had seemed too angry at the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a leading Republican Republican Republican against Waters in the Middle Ages, also commented on Twitter.
“ A great thing if it is true, ” he said.
Waters, in his statement, said that her office “had informed the competent authorities and law - enforcement officers of these untrue claims.
“ We will ensure that the guilty will be found, ” she continued, “and that they will be brought to justice for all those deeds that are devastating and dangerous to all my employees. ”
A film critic for Johnny English Strikes again spygrin with Rowan Atkinson proves to be weak
It has become customary to look for Brexit references in all new images where Britain is involved, and this seems to apply in this resuscitation of Johnny English comic series - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and just woken back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this perhaps satira as to how clearly we are a new export facility for the land?
Whether it is, or not, Johnny English's outgoing, horny, and squid have been refurbished for the second time to screw up everything - his name shows above all that he is created for a show in non-English speaking countries.
He is, of course, a wise detective who pretends to have a charming characterism but is a little mixed with Clouseau, a sadss of Mr. Bean and a little swat of the man who played a single note for the Chariots of Fire song at the opening of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
It is also originally based on the traveler and the mysterious citizen of the world whom Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television announcements, where he understood everything about himself in turmoil.
There are one or two good points in this latest Johnny English photo.
I enjoyed seeing Johnny English walking a helicopter wearing a middle - age breastplate and the helicopter blades turning into his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his sense of humor, but the humour seems rather powerless and strangely superficial, especially now that the “severe” films such as James Bond and Mission Impossible pictures also offer no sense of humor.
The game seems to be more for children than adults, and I thought the adventures Johnny English had got in less imagination and focused, like Atkinson's silent jokes, in the guise of Mr. Beans.
Now Britain is in great trouble.
A computer hacker has been able to break into the secret network of Britain's agents, and has identified the identity of all British spies, to a great extent for the agent on the watch - which unfortunately places Kevin Eldon in too small a role.
This is the final battle for the prime minister, who is arrogant and controversial of individuals and already in great trouble because of a huge political enemy: Emma Thompson does her best with her role as a person who is to be reminded of Theresa May, but the script is not for many fish for her.
Her counselors tell her that all active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who had already sat down in holy stone.
And that's where Johnny English comes to the story, now head of school at some fine school, but also gives secret instruction on how to be a spy: here's some funny jokes that English offers at a spy school that reminds me of the School of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets there Bough, his former long-tired partner, who Ben Miller plays again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine director, but in that powerful role, Vicki Pepperdine does not quite let his light shine.
The nebula, which screws up everything in Her Majesty's service, is now back to the gir and is meeting with Olgu Kurylenko, the dangerous woman, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the prime minister is impressed by the magic of the fascinating billionaire within the technology sector, who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their crash: they set fire to a fine French restaurant disguised as a servant, they make noises as they smuggle into Volta’s hatchbox, and English turns everything upside down when he tries to use virtuality glasses to explore the interiors of Volta’s house.
There is nothing to be saved in that final point, but even though the image is supple and powerful, it does not have much of the material in its entirety.
Medium-good stuff.
And just as with the other Johnny English pictures, I couldn’t help but think, can British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his abilities?
The task force denies that it is planning a four - day work week for the British, with the same salary as it did for a five - day week period.
The task force, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is now considering a radical plan that would allow the British to work for four days a week, but get paid for five.
According to the group, executives want to use the savings generated by the revolution in artificial intelligence, and to benefit employees by having one extra holiday.
Then employees could spend three days of the weekend, without reducing their salary.
According to sources, the idea would be “passing ” to the group’s economic programme and its policy of improving the interests of workers.
The Trade Union Congress union has supported the reduction of the working week for four days, which led workers to take advantage of economic changes.
A senior engineer from the Workers’ Party told the Sunday Times: “It is estimated that a review will be announced by the end of the year.
“ The change will not occur overnight, but four days of working week is an objective that matches the approach of the category to change the economy in the interests of workers and the overall industry. ”
The Workers’ Party would not be the first to support this idea, but the Green Group promised four days of work on its 2017 campaign.
The goal, however, is not supported by the entire working class.
One union spokesman said: “Four days of work is not on the class policy, and the group is not considering introducing it."
John McDonnell, secretary of business of the shadow Ministry, used the Labor Group's conference last week to describe his ideas of social revolution within the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to regain power from “unknown managers ” and“ crop congregations ” of enterprises.
The sham minister’s plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not be able to get their full share back, since the workers’ government could impose “distortion ” on the workers’ government due to alleged errors.
He has also confirmed plans to place employees in the management committees of companies and create a joint ownership fund to allow 10 percent of the assets of private companies to their employees, who could get 500 pounds of them annually into their pockets.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" whether the FBI's investigation on Kavanaugh could get them to change their mind
An investigation by the FBI into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a week's delay in the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court, and raises the question of whether its findings could bring back to the Senate the Republicans.
In an interview to be shown on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a reporter in the “60 minutes” feature of the Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican, asked John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal something that would change their mind.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his college from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” said Kennedy.
“ I said when the trial began, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After the charges were made, I called him and asked: “Did you do this? ”
He was determined, steadfast, undivided."
Graham’s vote, however, seems unchangeable.
“I’ve made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and there would be an amazing charge to change it,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but this is what I know: Brett firmly denied it,” Graham added and addressed Christine Blasey Ford.
“ And everyone she mentioned on her name could not confirm that.
This case is 36 years old.
I can't see anything new will change."
What is the International Civil Festival and has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be held on Saturday in New York City, an annual event where a series of great stars will appear and with a similar dramatic policy; ending poverty worldwide.
This is the seventh year that the International Civil Festival is held, and tens of thousands of people will move to Central Park, not only to listen to music items such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real goal of the festival to end severe poverty by 2030.
The International Civil Festival, which was first held in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project, which is an international organization that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of those who fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (except for those who want to pay for VIP tickets), players had to complete various projects, or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending e-mails to one of the world’s leaders, calling telephone calls, or using other valid ways to help draw attention to their goal of ending poverty.
But how much success has the festival achieved, now that 12 years are on course to reach its goal?
Is the idea of winning people with free concerts really a way to convince people to call for action, or is it just a so-called click action - where people think they're doing something important by signing a list of demands on the Internet or sending messages on Twitter?
Global Citizen reports that since 2011, it has recorded over 19 million “actions ” from its supporters to call for many different goals.
It says that these actions helped to get world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to over $350 billion that will affect lives over 2.25 billion by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and notifications for its operations, of which at least $10 billion has been invested or collected.
The group estimates that so far the amount of money collected has directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
A key commitment comes from The Power of Nutrition, a company of investors and managers in Britain who work to “help children to enjoy their full potential,” and promised to give 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help end their malnutrition, after receiving a 4700 message from Global Citizens.
“With support from Britain’s government, sponsors, governments around the world and international citizens like you, we can make the social injustices of malnutrition in the past,” said Tracey Ullmann, representing The Power of Nutrition to the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5,000 appeals were sent for the UK to improve mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
The list of common questions on the group website raises one of the questions: “Why do you think you can put an end to poverty? ”
Global citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult task - sometimes we will fail constantly.
But we will reach our goal, as will movements that fought for the rights of citizens and the dissociation of racial separation before us, for we are stronger together.
Among the participants at the event this year are Janet Jackson, the Week, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monae. The event will be held in New York City and the introductions are Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as an “inhibition” to prevent Russia’s energy export, says the Minister for the Interior.
“If necessary,” says Ryan Zinke, U.S. Secretary of State, “ Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russia’s power from reaching market levels, including in the Middle East, ” says a Washington Examiner report.
Zinke argued that aid to Russia in Syria, especially as it works under the legal government there, was an opportunity to explore a new market.
“ I believe that the reason for their existence in the Middle East is that they want to do business with energy, such as in Eastern Europe and its southern parts,” he says.
And, according to official announcement, there are ways and means to resist it.
“ The United States can use the Navy to ensure that maritime routes are open and to form a barrier, if necessary, to ensure that the energy from them cannot be marketed,” he said.
Zinke addressed a meeting of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity group called “the voice of the energy industry ” in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington’s approach to Russia with Iran and said she was more or less the same.
“ Iran’s and Russia’s economy choices are more and less practical for energy donors and to replace them with others,” he said, and said Russia has only one card in memory of an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements follow the fact that Trump's government wants to increase its greenhouse gas exports to Europe and replace Russia, a much cheaper alternative for European consumers.
To do this, public workers in Trump's government, including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to cancel participation in the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 project to put in new power, which Trump says would make Berlin the "capture" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the 11 billion dollars of Nord Stream 2’s energy output, which will double the current transport capacity of up to 110 billion cubic feet [110 billion km], is a purely economic project.
The Russians say that Washington’s opposition to the project is simply driven on for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we can share the view that energy can’t be a tool to use pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the supplies,” said Aleksandr Novak, energy minister of Russia, after a meeting with Rick Perry, energy minister of the United States, in Moscow in September.
The state of the United States has been criticized by Germany, who has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industrial organization of Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and two-sided agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I am very displeased with the fact that outside states are divided by our energy sources,” said Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting with Angela Merkel, German chancellor, and Vladimir Putin, president of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren says that “it will be considered seriously” to present herself to the presidency in 2020.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, said on Saturday that she would “consider seriously” to offer herself to the president after the mid - term benefits.
Warren confirmed that she would consider presenting herself to a civil meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“ It’s time for women to go to Washington and the rules of our government, and then a woman as a leader also needs, ” she said, according to a report from The Hill.
“ After November 6, I will seriously consider presenting myself to the president. ”
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump at the meeting and said that he was “going the country on the wrong course.
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been amazed at his criticisms of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, named his Supreme Court judge.
Friday, Warren on Twitter said that “of course we have to have the FBI investigate the matter before the vote takes place.”
However, a survey published on Thursday shows that the majority of voters in Warren’s state do not think it should be offered by 2020.
Fifty - eight percent “likely” voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not volunteer, according to a poll published by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent said they supported her offer.
The survey showed more support for Deval Patrick, former governor, who claimed to support his potential offer, and 48 percent claimed to be against it.
Among other popular democracys discussed for the possible presidential presentation in 2020 were former Vice President Joe Biden, and Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont.
Biden said he was going to make a public decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin speaks of a shock-trafficking disorder Track Palin at the Donald Trump campaign conference
The 26 - year - old Track Palin was in Iraq for one year after he joined the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
“ My son is going through a lot of trouble after coming back, I feel hurt with other families who are affected by stress disorders and the spiritual wounds that our soldiers return with, ” she said to the audience at a election meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room, ” saying that her son and other warriors“ came back a little different; they are hardy, wondering if there is any respect for what their military and military companions and other military forces have done for the land. ”
He was arrested on a Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, for trying to prevent an announcement of domestic violence and for armed violence under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, the spokesman of the police department in Wasilla.
18 Company and Washington D.C. support a challenge against a new asylum search policy
Eighteen states and Washington City support legal challenges against a new U.S. policy that refuses victims of gang violence or domestic violence for asylum.
Officials of the 18th and the City of Washington submitted a legal report on Friday, Washington, to support an asylum seeker who protests the policy, according to a report from NBC News.
The full name of the defendant in Grace v. Sessions has not been issued by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal policy.
She said that her spouse “and his violent sons who were members of the gang ” had violently abused her, but her application for asylum was rejected by American citizens on July 20.
She was put in custody in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries where problems with walking and domestic violence are increasing, and the number of asylum seekers to the United States comes from these countries.
The new asylum search policy reverses a decision taken by the National Appeals Committee in 2014 to allow non-registered immigrants who fled home abuse to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, State Prosecutor Washington, in his statement on Friday, stated that the new policy “remembered several decades of state and international law.”
“ The federal law requires a decision on all asylum applications based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this rule,” said the court report.
Lawyers further stated in the report that the policy of refusing entry was harmful to the economy of the United States, claiming that immigrants were more likely to start a business and “provide important labor. ”
Jeff Sessions, the State Prosecutor, ordered judges in immigration to stop giving refuge to victims who fled domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“ Those who leave their country because of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular community or political opinion can apply for asylum,” said Sessions in his announcement on June 11.
Homosexuals were never meant to solve all the problems, not even all the serious problems that people face every day worldwide.
Roughly lifesaving operations in a race to find survivors in Palu, the number of dead doubles
Conditions are becoming harder and harder for survivors.
“ There’s a lot of excitement in the air, ” said Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, who comforted her sick son at the relief center in Pala.
“ Hospitals are constantly bringing bodies here.
There's little clean water."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their deserted homes and searching for their water reserves to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals are overcrowded and damaged after the earthquake, which measured the 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who broke back and shoulder, lay outside the Pala army hospital, where patients were excluded from the front door due to continued vigorous tremor.
Tears filled his eyes as he explained how he found the earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save ourselves.
I pressed up to the murals, I think," said Haris to Associate Press and said that his family had been in town to go to the wedding.
“ I heard my wife calling for help, and then I kept quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of “consequences” with “prosperity advertisements”
A week after a public newspaper in China published a four - page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper about the mutual advantages of trade between the two countries, U.S. ambassador Peking accused him of taking advantage of American media to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, spoke last Wednesday about the Chinese newspaper Des Moines Register, which is the most widely sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to get involved in the American Congress, which will be November 6, China’s refusal to do so.
Trump’s accusation that Peking wanted to interfere with the U.S. congresses marketed what official U.S. representatives told Reuter’s news office that it was a new stage in an enlarging campaign from Washington to exert pressure on China.
Although it is natural for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote business, Beijing and Washington enjoy an ever - increasing commercial war, with new tolls on import goods from both countries.
Chinese and American experts say that early in the business war, the vengeful Chinese people were designed to damage immigrants in states such as Iowa, who supported Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador in China, and former governor of Iowa for a long time, which is a state carrying out a lot of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad stated in her detailed opinion in the Sunday newspaper Des Moines Register that “China was now increasing its persecution by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free media. ”
“ By spreading its propaganda, China’s government is taking advantage of the loving language tradition of the United States and our free media by publishing a costly advertisement in the newspaper Des Moines Register,” said Branstad in his article.
“ On the back of the day, ” he wrote, “there are few protesters in magazine sales booths on the streets of Beijing, and no true reflection of the differing views that the Chinese might have on China’s worrying economic policy, where the media are stuck under the heel of the Chinese Communist Party. ”
He added that “some of the largest newsprints in China escaped the offer to publish ” his article, but he did not say which magazine it was.
Experts warn that the Republicans are making female voters reject them for the mid-term payoffs on the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned of negative reactions, especially from women, during the next Middle Ages polls, because many Republicans have supported and defended Brett Kavanaugh, a named Supreme Court judge, who has accepted the charges of sexual harassment.
Very strong emotions have been around this issue, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they wanted to start voting.
“This stuff cannot be backed up,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Institute Maxwell School at Syracuse University, at The Hill, for a Saturday article.
Reeher expressed doubts about the fact that in the last minute, Senator Jeff Flake, in Arizona, was calling for an investigation by the F.B.A., to calm down the wrath of voters.
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday, so they will not forget it tomorrow and not November, ” said Karin Jean-Pierre, a counselor and spokesperson for the liberal group MoveOn, on Friday, according to Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang “November Approaching! ” when they protested at the Senate tunnels when the Republicans who ruled the Committee of Decisions decided to continue with Kavanaugh’s denial, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
“ The interest and enthusiasm of voters will go out of control, ” said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, at the news site.
“ People will say that interest was already great, and it is true.
But he might be bigger, especially in female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who don't like the president, but rarely choose."
The articles foretold setbacks if the Republicans pressed for confirmation of Kavanaugh, even for Ford’s testimony, in which she described her charges of sexual harassment from him.
“ This has become a big mess for the Repulse Party,” said Michael Still, former member of the Repulse Committee early in the week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench; it’s also about how the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have dealt with it,” said Guy Cecil, president of the Priorities United States, a group that helps to vote for Democrats, at the news station.
However, Americans seem to disagree with who should believe after testimony from both Ford and Kavanaugh, and a small majority support the latter.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents were sure to believe or likely believe the Ford testimony, while 35 percent claimed to believe or likely Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said that they had a computer called Kavanaugh, likely or certainly, lied, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the call from Fllake, the FBI is now investigating the charges that Ford made and at least one other woman, Deborah Ramirez, reported on the Guardian story.
In response to an oath before the Senate Committee last week, Ford said that she was attacked by Kavanaugh when she was 17 years old and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.

The man who invented the Internet has plans to start a new Internet to fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the Internet, is about to set up a sprinkling company to fight Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of technology myth, is a company based on Solid, the open workshop of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is saved and what people are allowed to access.
In a private interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee said in a joke that the intention behind Inrupt was “the authority of the world. ”
“ We have to do this now, ” he said, about the scepter company.
“ This is a historic moment. ”
The program uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own “personal data store on the Internet” or POD.
These include a list of contacts, project lists, calendars, music collections, and other personal and work - related devices.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all locations in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique feature of the personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what information.
The company calls it “personal election by using data."
According to John Bruce, president of the company, the idea is that Inrupt is that the company has resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security workshop purchased by IBM, several programmers hired as contractors to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
From this week onwards, scientists around the world could create their own independent program using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team do not have discussions with “Facebook and Google about whether to initiate an absolute change that would put their current business model on the head overnight.
“ We don’t ask them for permission. ”
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published on Saturday at Medium that Inrupt had it “to aim to create energy in business and ecosystems that help to protect the honesty and quality of the new web based on Solid.”
Berners-Lee changed the network in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the issue of network neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even while he comes on board the Inrupt.
“I’m optimistic for the next period of the network,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The priest and master of Victorian Cross from World War I honored
The only English priest to be honored with the Victorian Cross during World War I, which a soldier has been hailed in his hometown 100 years later.
Father Bernard Vann, who held the army uppermost position, received the cross on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later, a sniper killed him, and he never learned that he had received the highest honors of the British army.
His two grandfathers exposed a monument to him in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “wonderfully figurative ” that the memorial was exposed exactly 100 years from the accomplishment of his grandfather’s honour.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, his commanding officer Vann brought the Canal de Saint-Quentin cut “through a very thick fog and under a hard gunfire from cannons and machine guns. ”
Later, he ran to the firing line, and with “great courage, ” he led the line forward before attacking one of his team’s cannons and subverted three soldiers.
On October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war, a friend of a chief general was killed by a German sniper.
The 72 - year - old Michael Vann said that his grandfather’s heroic powers were “what I could never do, but something that makes you humble. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a crown of flowers after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he had “the privilege of participating in the parade ” and added that“ the fangs of a true hero are shown by the support so many display. ”
MMA fans woke all night to watch Bellator 206 get instead of seeing Gurru piggy
Just imagine, having woken up all night to see a crowded Bellator 206 just to be refused to see the main event.
The program included 13 battles from San Jose, six of them on the main schedule, and they were broadcast live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 o’clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British audiences had unexpected results when the broadcast turned over to Gurra piggy.
After all night, some were dissatisfied to watch the battle.
One Twitter fan described the difference in child material as “some sort of sick joke. ”
“In accordance with official rules, the subject was not suitable for viewers at six o’clock in the morning, so they had to switch to children’s material,” said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communication for Bellator, when asked out on the broadcast.
“ Yay, yes. ”
Scott Coker, director of Bellator, said they'd go over their schedule and take viewers in Britain to account in the future.
“I think that when I think about the review that we could probably solve this, ” said Coker.
“ But it is six o’clock in the morning on a Sunday there, and we can’t solve this until Sunday at our time, which is Monday with them.
But we're working on this.
Believe me, when the transmission was changed, many text messages were sent back and forth, and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to fix this, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't so, it was a public problem.
I can promise you this won't happen the next time.
We limit the night to five battles instead of six, as usual, but we tried too much and passed out.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “unfavorable” because of sexuality
Olympian diphtheria, Tom Daley, says that he had felt neglected by other people growing up because of his sexual tendencies, but that it encouraged him to succeed.
The 24 - year - old Daley said that he did not realize that “he was different from others ” until he was in high school.
On the radio program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Lavorne, Daley said that he talked about the rights of homosexuals to give others “hope. ”
He also said that parenting has reduced his interest in winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the ordinary partner, has taken several months off because of illness.
Daley was out of line in Laverne’s first part, saying that he felt that he was “less man than anyone else when he was a child because“ it wasn’t agreed in society to be fond of both boys and girls. ”
He said: “Up until today, these feelings of feeling inferior and different have given me the strength and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” so that he would not disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation was finally caught.
The double Olympic Bronze Sea has been a big supporter of LGBT and used its participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more nations to legalize homosexuality.
He said that he heard, because he felt lucky to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to give others “hope. ”
The World Champion three times said that it “had surprised him” to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar Prize winner, who was 20 years older than him, last year but said that the age difference had never been a problem.
“ When you go through so much at an early age” — but he joined his first Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later — he said it was difficult to find peers who had experienced similar success and difficulties.
In June, the couple adopted a child, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley, who said that “all his life’s views ” had taken place.
“ If you had asked me last year, ” he said, “it was all about winning a golden prize. ”
“ Know what, it’s more important things than the gold prize at the Olympic Games.
Robbie is my Olympic gold prize."
His son is baptized in the head of his father, Robert, who died in 2011, 40 years of age, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about was whether they had finished getting their tickets for London 2012 -- because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him that he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row,” he said.
“I held onto his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until his breath stopped, and he was let to admit at last that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
Next year, Daley won the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze prize.
“I just knew that I had dreamed of this all my life, diving in front of the audience at home at the Olympic Games; it doesn’t feel better,” he said.
There was also inspiration to the choice of the first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had given him inspiration for the Olympics and gave him still goose skin.
Desert Island Disc is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 p.m., at British local time.
Mickelson in a bad fit and he's sitting on the bench in Ryder's cup on Saturday
USman Phil Mickelson will hit the record on Sunday as he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to find his old beats back so that bad memories are not assessed.
Mickelson, who plays in the race for the 12th time, was put on the bench following the decision of the chief Jim Furyk for the four ball and four ball competitions on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the Hasar, as has been so often before for the United States, the day is divided by the five - fold champion between being a cheerleader and practicing the game moves on the field in the hope of correcting what it has to do.
Mickelson, 48 years old, was never the one who shot pointed with the killer, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National Golf Square, where want-to-stend glitter often punished for bad shot.
And not enough that the golf course is a great challenge in itself, but it takes Mickelson to compete against Frances Molinari, winner of the British Open, in the ninth game on Sunday. Molinari is with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood in the team and together they have won all four of their games this week.
If the four - point Americans are taking the first game of 12 solo games, getting a good start, Mickelsons might make a difference.
Fury declared confidence in his husband, but he could hardly say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had today, patting on my back, and saying that he would be ready tomorrow,” said Fury.
“ He has a lot of confidence.
He's at the famous hall, and he's been so much better for the past and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I could see more, but that's how it ended, and we thought we had to go that way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will hit Nick Faldo's record in a number of played games in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of the process in the Ryder Cup, which has never achieved just as high as other achievements on its file.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and 7 drawbacks, but Fury said that his presence had a vague effect on the people.
“ He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s good at making fun of people, and it’s great to have him in the team room, ” he explained.
“ I think the younger players enjoyed fighting him too this week, and it was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just the golf game."
The President of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that much progress can be made quickly.
The President of the European Parliament, Thomas Bjorn, knows from experience that before the last day of each individual race in the Ryder Cup, an unpleasant experience can easily be changed.
The dance was first played in Valderrama in 1997, where a five - point head of the commanding officer Seve Ballesteros had a five - point head over the Americans, but he was right to demand victory at the end with the least possible score difference, with a 141⁄2-131⁄2 win.
“It always reminds us that we had a lot of head start in Valderrama, we had a lot of head start in Brookline, where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, but only just so,” said Bjorn, who is shown here in the picture, after watching the 2018 season, win 5-3 both Friday and Saturday and get the lead 10-6 on the Le Golf National.
The story will show me and everyone in the team that it's not over.
We're all going forward tomorrow.
Let's go do everything right.
This is not done until all the steps are on the table.
We have our goals, and it is trying to win this cup, we focus on it
I've always said this, I've focused on the 12 players in our team, but we're very conscious of our fellow soldiers in the other team--the best golfer in the world."
Bjorn was thrilled with how his players had stood in a difficult situation and added: “I am never doing this to myself.
Tomorrow's gonna be a whole different day.
Tomorrow, it's the performance of the individuals that matters, and that's another thing.
It's great to play with partners when everything's going well, but when you play alone you're trying on every man's talent as a golfer.
It's the message that has to be sent to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and he also has to play his best game himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, will seek his players to be better at individual games than with partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Fury himself has experienced both sides of this great transition on the last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brookline but ended up losing when Europe carried out the “Medinah miracle.”
“ I remember every goddamn word, ” he replied, asking how Ben Crenshaw, the lead in 1999, had continued to encourage his players before the last day.
“ We have to play 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start fast, as happened in Brookline and Medinah.
As that crack nears to build up, it puts a lot of pressure on the game that is in the middle.
We ordered our players according to it and let them play as we feel will be best tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defense and against Rory McIllroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half of the games.
“I chose these players in this order because I think they’re going all the way through,” Bjorn said about their choice of players in the individual competition.
Germany’s new military ship is being postponed again
The latest military ship of the German Navy should have been built in 2014 to replace old warships from the Cold War period, but it will not be ready until next year, at least in the first place, because of broken systems and ever - increasing costs, according to local news.
Based on the “Rheinland-Phalz” commanding ship of the brand - new military ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg, the former half of 2019 has now been postponed, according to the sources of the military spokesman speaking to the Die Zeit magazine.
The ship was to be taken advantage of by the Navy in 2014, but serious problems had arisen after the task was given.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to replace the military ships of the Bremen group, which are now in their years.
They should be prepared for a more powerful cannon, many air protection and ship-to-ship fire launchers, including reduced radar infrared, and sound signals.
Other important features are longer use time – the latest ships should be used for up to two years away from their ports of origin.
On the other hand, constant delays mean that these latest military ships - which are said to enable Germany to demonstrate its strength on seas - will be when obsolete is finally taken advantage of, says Die Zeit.
The F125 military ship came to the news last year when the German army officially refused to accept the flop and returned it to the Blohm & Voss slip in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
A little was known about the reasons behind the divorce, but the German media spoke of a number of women who were seriously “miscellaneous about software and hardware, ” which, if sent to a military campaign, would make the ship useless.
Software flaws were particularly important, as ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by 120 people, half of whom are less than those of the Bremen group.
It was also found that the ship was too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the capacity of the Navy to improve its position in the future.
The 7,000 tons of “Rheinland-Palatinate” ships are thought to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar category used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from hardware defects, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is beginning to cause problems.
It is said to have reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), originally worth 2.2 billion euros.
Problems that plague the latest ships are particularly important in view of the warning that the excesses of Germany’s oceans are decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy was actually becoming “incapacitated by a working ship. ”
The agent said that the problem had been sidetracked over time, for older ships were taken out of use, but no ships were replaced.
He lamented that none of the orders of the Baden-Wuerttemberg group could be taken into use by the Navy.
National Trust the Natural Protection Organization spying on the secret life of the leather bladders
A new study, conducted in the Scottish highlands, aims to find out how bats use the landscape when they catch for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation measures.
The study, which scientists at the National Trust for Scotland regime will monitor different types of bats in Inverewe’s Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be set up in key locations around the area to monitor the behaviour of the bats over the period.
NHS staff and volunteers will also be on patrols with handheld sensors.
Experts will record all recordings to find the frequency of the bats and what types of calls.
Maps of territory and reports will then be published to create an accurate picture of their geographic behavior.
Mr. Rob Dewar, NTS district consultant, hopes that the results will reveal the type of habitats that are most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of land management, e.g. by creating meadows, and how best to maintain woodlands for bats and other related species.
In the last century, the number of bats has decreased considerably in Scotland and throughout Britain.
They are at risk from construction and development projects that affect their nests and reduce habitats.
Windmills and light may also pose risks, including flypapers and certain building materials handling agents, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
On the other hand, the ears benefit much better than the eyes when it comes to catching prey, because they usually hunt at night.
They used high - tech rock - finishing technology to detect insects and objects that are on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for maintaining over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land all over the country, takes bats very seriously.
In the organization, ten experts who carry out regular checks, nest examinations, and sometimes rescue operations are involved.
The organization has even set up the first and only bat country in Scotland at the Threave ranch in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten bats of Scotland have their homes.
David Thompson, the overseer of the farm, says he is a perfect territory for them.
“ Threave’s area is great for bats, ” he said.
“ We have old buildings, plenty of grown trees and plenty of good habitats.
But there are still a lot of senseless things about bats, so the work we do here and in other places will help us to understand better what they need to clean up."
He stressed the importance of studying bats before being carried out in establishments, as possibly accidental destruction of one nest can kill up to 400 female bats and young people and destroy all the bats in the area.
Bats are protected, and killing, harassing, or disrupting their nests is forbidden.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish representative of Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we don’t know how well many of their species work. ”
Ronaldo denies the charges of rape when lawyers prepare a bill against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called charges against him for rape “false stories ” and says that people want to“ pay attention to themselves ” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The advance for Portugal and Juventus has been charged with raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He's said to have paid her $375.000 for talking about the incident, according to Der Spiegel's report on Friday.
A few hours after the charges were published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, said in Instagram Live video to 142 million his followers that they were “false news. ”
“ No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today is false news," the world champion said five times to the camera.
“ These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and everything's fine," added the player to smiling.
Lawyers Ronaldos prepare to prosecute Der Spiegel for the accusations, which they have called “unacceptable disclosure of privacy suspicions, ” according to Reuter’s news office.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said Ronaldo would demand compensation for “the same degree of severity as the severity of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years. ”
The alleged incident has taken place in June 2009 in a suite in the Palm Hotel and in the Las Vegas casino.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorta reportedly returned to the player’s room, where he was to have raped her in the rec room, according to documents prepared for Clark County’s district of Nevada.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the wrong incident and told her that he was a “99 percent good man” who fell into temptation because of “1 percent. ”
The documents claim that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex but had both consents.
Mayorga claims that she went to the police and had pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but finally accepted outside the courtroom because she was “thorought of revenge ” and was concerned about being“ brought down publicly. ”
She now says that she wants to stop the reconciliation because she is still in shock after an actual incident.
Ronaldo was close to going to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape was to take place, and this summer he passed over to the Italian giant Juve with a EUR 100 million contract.
Brexit: Britain would “see for eternity ” to lose car manufacturers
Britain would “see to time indefinite ” if it lost its position as an international leader among automobile manufacturers after Brexit, says Greg Clark.
He added that it was “a cause of concern” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a contract, the company would temporarily stop manufacturing its factory in Burnaton, near Derby.
“We need a contract,” said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that if Brexit had no contract, the effect of delaying borders would be to cost jobs.
The Burnaton factory, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis automobiles, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European countries.
“My opinion is that if Britain turns out to fall out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production stations in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Director-General of Toyota, Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have voiced concerns about EU exits without agreement on how to conduct cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims that it will close its Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is that if Brexit without a contract becomes a reality, car manufacturers claim to be a target chain risk.
Toyota’s production line is based on the reception at the “last hour” where parts are delivered every 37 minutes from ships both in the United Kingdom and the EU for cars produced after ordering.
If Britain withdraws from the EU without a contract on 29 March, there could be disruptions to the border which industry believes could lead to a lack of intervention.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than daily stock in his factory in Derbyshire, said the company, and therefore production would stop.
Mr. Clark said that the Chequers Programme for Theresu May for a future relationship with the EU “was specifically aimed at preventing these views at the border.”
“We have to have a deal, we want to get the best deal that enables us to enjoy not only success in modern times, but opportunities we can use,” he said on a radio show on BBC Radio 4.
“ The evidence, not just from Toyota but from other manufacturers, also shows that we must be able to continue with very effective means of delivery.
Toyota could not tell us how long their production would be stopped, but warned that in the long run, the cost would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaton for 24 years and who is a confidant of the union at the factory, said that his associates were increasingly concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs never go away, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a detailed and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
On Sunday, the White House declared that an important meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein, a federal prosecutor, might be “returning for a week,” now the dispute with Brett Kavanaugh, a designated Supreme Court judge, continues.
Rosenstein oversees Robert Mueller's work, a special prosecutor, who investigates Russian intervention in elections, links between the assistants of Trump and Russia, and possible obstacles to the progress of justice by the President.
For weeks, rumours have been going on in Washington as to whether Trump will run an assistant prosecutor, thereby endangering Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about carrying a recording device to pick up a conversation with Trump and the possibility of escalating the president by using the 25th paragraph of the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
But last Monday, he visited the White House, including news that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump on Thursday, then with the United Nations in New York City.
Trump said “preferably not” to fire Rosenstein, but then he was tempted to be at the same time as the hearing of the Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who have accused him of sexual harassment, witnessed both.
On Friday Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh, which delayed the vote of the Senate Department even further.
Sarah Sander, a media representative of Trump, was on the broadcast in the movie Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked out at the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It’s not yet decided on a date for him, it might be this week, and I think it’s possible that he will be postponed another week because of everything else that is going on at the Supreme Court.
But we see, and it is always my pleasure to inform the media."
Some reporters disagree: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Parse manager Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not overjoyed at the fact that TV reporters had “visualism, ” but she said:“ I don’t disagree with the fact that they have virtualism. ”
She then indicated that a direct relationship between Trump and the media would increase.
“The president answers more questions than any other president has done before, ” she said, without referring to the statement, “We have considered these figures. ”
“ If the media have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is much better than talking to me.
We try to do much of it and you've seen us do much of it in the past few weeks and it will replace a press conference when we can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions as he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or media meetings with other visitors.
There are few media meetings with him alone.
The president may have shown this reason for this week in New York, when he showed himself loose and in times of strange conduct in front of a group of reporters.
The Minister for Health writes EU healthcare professionals in Scotland because of Brexit’s concern
The Minister for Health has written EU staff working in the health system in Scotland (NHS Scotland) to declare their gratitude and wish to continue working after Brexit has gone through.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter when it is less than six months until Britain leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already promised to meet the cost of licence applications for EU citizens working within the public service provider.
In her letter, Miss Freeman wrote: “After the summer discussions between the United Kingdom and the EU on account of accounts continue and are expected to take place in the fall.
The British Government has also been preparing if there is no contract.
I know this must be a great uncertainty time for all of you.
That is why I would like to say again how much I appreciate the work of all the staff, no matter their nationality.
EU and non-EU cooperation partners offer valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve health services and to improve the benefits of the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we want you very much to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after having a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a lineman for Tennessee State Tigers, had to undergo emergency surgery after having had a head injury in 31-27 against the team Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to Mike Organ's report, journalist Tennessee.
Rod Reed, chief Coach Tennessee State, told reporters that the trauma had occurred shortly before halftime.
“ He came to the sideline and fell down there, ” said Reed.
Abercrombie gave oxygen to the sideline before being placed on a stretcher and carried off for further examination.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris WSMV, Nashville, Radio, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had had surgery at the Vanderbilt hospital.
Harris added that there was “no information on the type or severity of the injury” and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, who is in her final year at school, plays her first period with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five holdings all over on Saturday before he left, which increased the total number of holdings with him up to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher stamping fees when buying real estate in the United Kingdom, which will be used to help the homeless, according to a new Food and Agriculture policy.
Operation will eliminate Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
Increased stamping fees will be charged to non-taxed persons in the UK
Government funds plan to raise 120 million pounds a year - to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher stamping fees when buying real estate in the UK, and the money will be used to help the homeless. Theresa May will report this today.
The operation will be considered an attempt to eliminate the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by promising housing at the recommended price and taxing high - paying.
Individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom have to pay higher plunger fees, and the surplus will take action by the government to help the homeless.
The increase - which is in addition to the current plunger costs, including the increase that was made two years ago in an extra home and property purchase for rent - could be up to three percent.
The government fund estimates that the increase will raise as much as £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new buildings in London are purchased by foreign individuals, which increases prices and makes it harder for those who want to buy real estate for the first time to get into the market.
Many more prosperous lands — especially in the capital — have become “drag towns ” because of the number of foreign merchants who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called after a reduction in plungers to help other young people get their first home.
He accused large construction companies of buying land but not using it, and urged May to cancel household bids at the recommended price to fix Britain’s “household prices. ”
Mr. Corbyn has reported on a number of significant improvements in housing, including rent control, and the end of rental without cause.
He also wants to give advice greater power to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “I said last year that I would devote myself to the restoration of my British dream during my first period — that every new generation should enjoy a better quality of life.
And that includes fixing our corrupt real estate market.
Britain’s doors will always be open to those who want to live here, work, and build their lives.
However, it cannot be true that it is as easy for a foreigner as a company with headquarters abroad to buy homes as well as for hardworking British citizens.
For many, the dream of their own dwelling has become far too distant, and the shame of homelessness is still too real."
Jack Ross: “My main goal is to train Scotland”
Sunderland, Coach Jack Ross, says that becoming Scotland’s coach is his “principal goal. ”
The 42 - year - old Scot now enjoys the challenge of blowing a new life in the North-East Club, which now sits third in the first division, three steps from the top.
He moved to Sunderland for the summer after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Selection Department during the last season.
“ I wanted to play for my people as a player.
I got hurt on my knee and that's where it was finished," said Ross in an interview with Sportsound at the BBC Scotland.
“ But I grew up watching Scotland, Hampden, with my dad, as a child, and there’s always something that has drawn me back.
But that opportunity would only be possible if I was successful in training the department team."
The predecessors of Ross as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of the Alloa Athletic club said that there was no fear of following in such famous names at such a large club, but he had previously rejected training stations at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“ As is the case, I will recommend my success by thinking, ‘ Can I get this club back to the finals? ’
This club definitely lives at home in the finals section because of his building and position," he said.
“ It’s not an easy job to get him there, but I’d probably only consider myself successful here if I get the club back up there."
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach after a period of training at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of a training course for Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from falling into the third division, and changed St. Mirren, who was about to fall for division, into the next league champion’s season later.
Ross says he was more confident now than ever in his playwright at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“ This was probably a real convention, ” he says, about the period when he became a coach to Alloa.
“ I really believed that the training work was suitable for me, even more than playing.
It sounds amazing, because I went well, I had reasonable income from it and enjoyed reasonable success.
But changes can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot every week.
I still go through this with regard to stress and pressure from the job, but the training work simply seems right for me.
I always wanted to train, and now I do. I've never felt better about myself in all my adulthood."

The best time for beer is at 5.30 p.m. on Saturdays, according to a survey
The heat wave this summer has proved to be profitable for a basilized British bar, but it has increased pressure on restaurants.
The sales of pobs and berries increased by 2.7 percent in July, while the sales of restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, of CGA, who compiled the figures, said: “The continuing sunshine and unexpected success of England in the world cup meant that July followed a pattern similar to June when barsal grew by 2.8 percent, except for what restaurants sold even less.
The sale fell by 1.8 percent at restaurants in June and got worse again in July.
Pebbs and bars, mainly drinking - selling, were far more varied during the downwards of restaurants.
Pops who sold food also found it difficult in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems people just wanted to go out drinking.
Drinking is done in pobs and carryes increased by 6.6 percent a month, while a food dealer decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, from the research firm RSM, said: “These results are continuing the shift we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sports events are still major factors in the sale of foreign markets.
It is not surprising that even though sales reductions of 4.8 percent between months are particularly painful on the continuation of pressure caused by expense, the restaurant groups still have difficulties.
This long and warm summer could hardly set at worse times for restaurants, and only time will tell whether tempuring temperatures, as we have had in August, will improve the situation."
Total sales growth in pobs and restaurants, including newly-opened sites, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slow opening rate.

One in five children has secret accounts for social media that they hide from their parents
One in five children, down to 11 years of age, has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey involving 20,000 students showed an increase in the "gest Insta" pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual material
Twenty percent of students say they have a “principal” account they show parents
One in five children, down to 11 years of age, make secret accounts for social media that they keep secret to adults.
A survey of 20,000 students showed a significant increase in the use of “insta’s ” accounts — a reference to the Instagram site.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual material.
Twenty percent of students said that they had a clean “primary ” account to show their parents, as well as keeping secret accounts.
One mother, who fell down on her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret website, found a teenager who urged others to “pray at me. ”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the National Executive Director (HMC), showed that 40 percent of children 11-18 years of age had two accounts, and half of them admitted to keeping classified accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: “It is a concern that so many youths are tempted to make an area online where parents and teachers cannot find them. ”
Elidh Doyle will be “the voice of athletes” at the Scottish Athletics Sports Committee
The Scottish Athletics Committee has been selected as head of the non-executive committee at the annual General Meeting of the Government.
Doyle, who is the most successful athlete of Scotland and Ian Beattie, said that the appointment was a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from its great experience in international affairs over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect within sports communities in Scotland, Britain and internationally, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would make a lot of money to get her on the committee,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am very interested in speaking on behalf of athletes and hope that I can do my part and help lead the sport on in Scotland."
The U.S.A., who worked among ananirs 200 metres and 400 meters [400 m] of the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, but in total four Olympic gold, and is now a regular visitor at the BBC, was paralysed after a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “For one month, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would tell if I recovered from them to the extent possible.
This has been hard work, but I completely recovered, learned to walk again, and practice sports today!
Thank you for your words of encouragement!"
A breast-pump advertisement that compares mothers to cows causes a network conflict
A company that produces a breast pump is now talked about on the Internet because of advertisements that carry lactating mothers with lactating cows.
The company Elvie published a good advertisement to mark a presentation of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pumps, which can be carried on the outside. ”
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cow a song with words such as: “Yes, I’m milking, but you can’t see any tails on me ” and“ If you didn’t notice, it’s not juice, it’s my chest. ”
The appeal continues: “Pumping, pumping, feeding, pumping, pumping, pumping, pumping, pumping milk out of the jellies. ”
However, the advertisement appearing on the Facebook page of the company has caused online publicity.
The video has 77,000 audiences and hundreds of comments and has received a disparaging response from the audience, who say that she was involved in the ‘ horror ’ of the dairy industry.
“ A really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just as we do, they need to get pregnant and carry to produce milk, except what the calves are taken away from them just a few days after they are born," said in one comment.
The Elvie breast pump is suitable for comfortable breast-feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another observer wrote: “Surely, it is difficult for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added: “This advertisement is completely out of line with time. ”
Others came to the defense, and one woman admitted that she was meant to be “sudden. ”
“ I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought this if I still had a baby.
When I was pumping out milk, I felt exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it as she is.
It's a genius," wrote one of the audience.
Another said: “This is a fun advertisement that is directed to mothers who pump milk (often in workplaces or in a ice cap) and feels like “cows. ”
It is not an advertisement that commends or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the advertisement, the women show that they were all dancing with their breast pumps hidden in their bras.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women say that they feel like cows when they pump milk.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires, no wires, and fits comfortably into a bra that gives women freedom to move, hold their baby, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, co - owner and commander of Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is so revolutionary as to be understood by a prominent presentation that would bring publicity.
By likening women to cows, we wanted to direct the flashlight to breast - pumping and all its challenges, even showing in a fun and familiar way how much freedom the new pump would provide.
This isn't the first time Elvie pump's made the news.
During the fashion week in London, two children’s mother presented a fashion show to the designer Martha Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrants moved quietly to Texas border tents
A number of detention residents have suddenly increased even if the number of persons crossing the border has remained somewhat the same every month. Part of the reason is that tough words and policies put forward by Trump’s government have made it harder to have children on a temporary foster.
Usually, the foster parents have been unregistered immigrants themselves, and they fear to put their chances of remaining in the country at risk by offering themselves to foster a child.
The risk increased in June, when public authorities announced that potential foster parents and other adults in the home had to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, chief of the immigration and toll authorities, witnessed before the Senate Department and said that his institution had arrested a number of people who applied for fostering single children.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not on the criminal record.
“ Nearly 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or in homes that foster children are illegal in the country, and much of them are illegal immigrants on criminal records.
“ Therefore, ” said Mr. Albence, “we continue to look for those individuals.
In an effort to work more quickly on their children, representatives announced new rules requiring some children to appear in court within one month of being held in custody, rather than after 60 days of the first convention, according to staff involved in the conversions.
Many of these will come through a video meeting, rather than in person, to provide reasons for their legal position before judges in immigration.
Children who are sentenced to enter the land are sent out quickly.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent tendencies or attempts to escape, according to the local staff and reports published by the system over the past few months.
Speakers said that these problems were even more likely in a larger institution, such as Tornillo, where it is likely that no one will notice that a child is having difficulty because of the number of them.
They added, therefore, that the transfer of children to the tent city without giving sufficient time to prepare them spiritually or to say good - bye to friends could result in a shock that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria says that the “armital army ” of the United States, France and Turkey will immediately withdraw
Walid al-Moualem, Foreign Secretary, also said in his speech to the UN General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays the role of the vice president, said that foreign troops were illegal in Syria, under the false assumption that they were fighting terrorism, and that “they will be treated accordingly. ”
“ They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions, ” he said to the council.
Moualem firmly insisted that “the war against terrorism was almost over ” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have had to flee their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue “to wage this holy fight until we cleanse all Syrian territories ” from both terrorist groups and“ all illegal foreign entities. ”
The United States has about 2,000 Syrian soldiers, where most of them train and advise both Ukrainian troops and Syrian Arabs who fight against the President Bashar Al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war - torn country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said that the situation was good enough for them to return, and he taught “some Western lands ” to“ spread a senseless fear ” that encouraged refugees to stay away.
“ We have called upon an international community and a humanitarian organization to facilitate their return,” he said.
“ They make politics out of something that should be purely humanitarian. ”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will provide no funding for reconstruction in Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the resistance to bring the war to an end.
According to the U.S.S.A., a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a neutral territory in the last great castle of resistance has opened up the opportunity to continue political dialogue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a heavy attack by Syrian troops strengthened by Russia, in the region where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had “declarable final detention” and expressed the hope that military operations would be targeted at Jihadites, including those from the Nusra Front who were associated with Al-Qaeda, and that they were“ destroyed. ”
Mr. Staffan de Mistura, Ambassador of the USSR, hopes to be able to attend the first meetings with a new committee composed of members of the Government and the Resistance, to draw up a constitution for Syria after the war and to clear the road for election.
Moualem stated that his work should be limited to “stepping over the provisions of the present government, ” and warned of any intervention.
Reasons that Trump will win another election period
According to this argument, Mr Trump would win the rollover in 2020, unless the charges and scandals put an end to his presidential career, as many liberal observers probably hope.
In what would unquestionably “the most dramatic end of a presidential career ever! ”
As you can see, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the best estimate of best time has doubled to 1.05 million in CNN, almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
The Fox News, on average, has 2.4 million audiences at the best time, an increase from 1.7 million audiences four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC “The Rachel Maddow Show ” show, has peaked with up to 3.5 million audiences on important news nights.
“ This is a fire that people are attracted to, because it is something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, associate leader of the ABC drama factor “Designed Survivor” about a government employee who will be president after the Parliament House is destroyed.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” has another illustration.
She remembers a trip to a taxi in Boston for election in 2016.
The cab driver told her he was gonna vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?
“ He said, “Because he makes me laugh,” said Miss Scovell to me.
There's entertainment value in the mess.
However, unlike television, stories from Washington could determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be united and the health of the international economy.
Only the audience who enjoy the greatest of privileges can afford to stop watching.
And yet, this is more than being informed by a citizen when you watch the sixth hour of a group of experts arguing about the use of Bob Woodwards on the “early ” sources for their book “Fear,” or $15,000-dollar jacket from ostriches that Paul Manafor wore (“a garment that is lined with haughtiness,” said Washington Post) and the consequences of the precise biological descriptions of Stormy Daniel on Mr. Trump.
At least I'll never see Super Mario's eyes again.
“The part of what he does dissipates you, as a reality factor, is that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the “Pawn Stars” feature of Trump’s performance, and daily changes in the history thread (e.g. starting a fight with N.F. and complimenting on Kim Jong-Un).
You can't miss one thing, or you lose the thread.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss, there was 26 degrees of heat and sunshine outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, who stayed indoors and watched MSNB while he picked up CNN.
He could not break himself away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to testify before the Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were making all these crazy things in the old days, and people said, “This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” said Mr. Fleiss to me.
“ I thought it was some sort of joke, but it turned out that people were right. ”

Money to outflow in the shortest election of the middle period
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania will see the money flowing to it, thanks to a reorganization in the local areas that led to two representatives competing for the same seats.
The newly reorganized Pittsburgh region sends out the Democratic Conor Lamb, who worked his seat in second district in special elections last summer.
Lamb presents himself to another representative, Keith Rothfus, who is now representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is in sharp contrast with the new 17th district.
In January, the maps of selected areas were reorganized after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decreed that the old districts were organized in favour of the Republicans and that they were breaching the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th district has begun to compete in the financing of election campaigns between the major financial intermediaries of both categories, the Democratic Committee of the Regions (DCCC) and the Committee of the Repubes (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in special elections in March preceding the 18th district of Pennsylvania, many of which watched them.
The Republican people had previously been in a worse position for over a decade, and Donald Trump, president of the town, was defeated by 20 points.
Politic experts have given democrats some headway.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador on the basis of support for China, but then stopped.
Kingdom transactions noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already accepted Peking, with little protests from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, president of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the owners drove the Trump leadership team away.
Foreign Ministry representatives decided to call back the U.S. ambassador in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama because of “a new decision to accept Taiwan no longer,” said Heather Nauert, minister of the Ministry in a statement early this month.
However, penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which was estimated to have received $140 million from the United States for relief work in 2017, including drug monitoring, development work and financial support.
The penalties imposed, including a reduction in financial support and restrictions on the release of residence permits, would have been painful for the Central American country, with high unemployment and high mortality rates.
As insider meetings continued, American and Central American representatives postponed a conference on security and economic success and were to follow up on a similar meeting held last year and were supposed to be a step forward in action to prevent people from moving to the United States.
In mid - September, however, representatives of the highest order made it clear that they wanted the convention to take place, and as a result, they ended up with all allegations of punishment against El Salvador.
Mike Pence, vice president, now addressed the convention to be held in the middle of October, as a symbol of how important it is in the eyes of the government, told the ambassadors.
The three U.S. ambassadors also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to discuss the discussions described by the three U.S. representatives, including two ambassadors, who agreed to discuss the inside debate against being anonymous.
Their description was confirmed by an outsider who works closely with the government and also spoke about the matter against anonymity.

The next scandal could be Robert Mueller's special prosecutor's report on possible measures, Mr Trump, to prevent justice, but for that accusation there are many official evidence.
It is also said that Mr Mueller will also turn his investigation into whether Mr Trump's campaign worked with Russia in its attack on our election.
If the council is governed by another class, Trump may have to be accountable to it, in the mouth he prepares to meet his constituents again, and perhaps his appointed peers.
However, this is extremely uncertain, and I do not want to suggest that Trump's fall is beyond question, nor that his colleague's fall in Europe.
We all need to choose, both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, which will affect the length of the battle.
In 1938, German rulers were ready to rob Hitler, only if Western countries had resisted and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed to do so and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of disaster that followed.
History revolves around such important points, and it speeds up or slows down for the unstoppable conduct of democracy.
The Americans are facing such important points now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Mr. Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this magazine told me that last year he had made secret recordings of the president and discussed whether he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times story isn't right.
“ How will we react if the recent FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not detailed or reasonable, or if it is confirmed in the seat of the Supreme Court judge despite religious accusations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote for a parliament in the mid-term that will allow Mr Trump to shoulder responsibility?
If we fall into these tests, democracy will have to endure long winters.
But I don't think we're going to fall because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother, a Jewish from Czechoslovakia, was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government and used to sit in my ambassador’s office.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with the hook.
With such an inheritance, how can I not look at our future in a positive way?"

Graham Dorrans, Rangers' team, optimistic for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory against the Austrians will put them in a strong position to get out of the G-group of the European Union. Rangers made a magnificent draw in Spain against Villaarreal earlier this month.
The injury to the knee prevented the middle man Graham Dorrans from playing his first game in the season until in the game against the wild area, which ended with a 2-2 draw, but he believes the Rangers can use the outputs that jump to better results.
“ It was good to get this score for us, for the Willarreal is a strong team,” said Dorran, 31 years old.
“ We started playing in the belief that we could get something, and we ended up taking one point.
Perhaps we could have claimed victory at the end, but overall it was probably a fair outcome.
They were probably better at the first half, and we got strong in the second half, and we played better.
Thursday is another important night for the European Union.
I hope we can reach three points, but it's gonna be a tough game because they did a good job at their last game, but with the audience who supports us, I'm sure we'll push this up and get a positive outcome.
The last year was difficult, both because of my injuries and the changes that occurred in the club itself, but now the place has a good feeling.
The team is good and the boys are enjoying themselves, the training is good.
I hope we can go further now, set the last season behind us and achieve results."
Women lose sleep because of the fear of losing pension savings
Although participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide survey said that they discussed the cost of long - term care with their mate.
Only 10 percent of them said that they talked to their children.
“People want a family member to care for it, but it doesn’t take the right steps to have that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide biosecurity department.
That's the way to begin.
Talk to your mate and your children: You cannot prepare your family for caring if you do not make your wishes known to them with good caution.
Talk to your counselor and your family about where and when you will be cared for, as these options can greatly change your cost.
Get your financial advisor to agree on this: Your counselor can also help you find a way to pay for this cost.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care is traditional life insurance with long-term care, mixed life insurance that pays out in cash, to help pay the cost, or self-assurance with your own money - as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: Prevent legal differences in advance.
Get a health care provider so that you can contact someone you trust to supervise your health care care and ensure that your healthcare professional responds to your wishes if you cannot tell them directly to your own needs.
Also, consider receiving procurers for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your accounts are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your aged father or mother lands in an emergency and is going to a hospital.
Could you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Please provide them with detailed information in your written plan so that you are ready.
“ It’s not just about financial matters, it’s about who the doctors are, ” said Martin.
“ What are the drugs?
Who's gonna watch the dog?
Make that plan ready."

Earthquakes and Floods in Indonesia
At least 384 died after a violent earthquake and flooding in the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, said the representatives, and it is expected that the number of the dead will rise.
Since all communications are down, relief workers have been unable to provide any information from Donggala County, a region north of Pala, near the center of the earthquake, which was 7.5 on Richter.
More than 16,000 people were left in Pala after the calamity struck.
Here are some key facts about Pala and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province and is located at the bottom of a narrow flea on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The estimated number of inhabitants was 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th birthday when the earthquake and the flood wave came upon.
Donggala is a county that covers more than 380 miles [380 km] of shoreline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regional government had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main professions in the Central Sulawesi region, especially in the Donggala coastal area.
Nickel studies are also important in the region, but most of them are in Morowali, which is on the beach in the face of Sulawesi.
In the case of Pala and Donggala several times in the past century, flooding has swept through a disaster institution in Indonesia.
In 1938, more than 200 people died when a tidal wave struck, and hundreds of Donggala houses were destroyed.
In 1996 the west of Donggala, where nine died, will also be flooded.
Indonesia sits on the active Pacific fire ring, where earthquakes are regular.
Here are major earthquakes and floods last year:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh in the northern Sumatra rode over on December 26 and launched a flood wave that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian shoreline, of which there were more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: The number of strong earthquakes crossed the west coast of Sumothra late in March and early in April.
Hundreds die on Nias Island, from the shore of Shumothra.
2006: A earthquake of 6.8 on Richter’s ride across the southern part of Jöva, the most populous island of Indonesia, caused a flood that hit the southern shore and killed almost 700 people.
2009: Earthquakes of 7.6 on Richter’s ride near Padang, the capital of the province of western Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: Earthquakes of 7.5 on Richter rode over one of the Mentawai island, near the Shumothra, and raised up up to 10 meters of flood waves that destroyed many villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The shallow earthquake over Pidie Jaya County in Aceh caused destruction and panic as people remembered the destruction in the deadly earthquakes and the flood waves in 2004.
This time there was no flood wave, but more than 100 died as buildings collapsed.
2018: Large earthquakes over Lombok, Indonesia, and more than 500 people died, mainly on the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped on the island.
Sarah Palin’s oldest son arrested for a charge of domestic violence
Track Palin, Sarah’s oldest son, former governor of Alaska and Presidential candidate, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29 years of age and from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested because of a suspicion of domestic violence, for trying to prevent a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report by the Alaska State Police, published on Saturday.
According to a police report, Palin took his friend off the phone when she tried to call the police to report an alleged crime.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su station where he is waiting for the hearings of the court, and he is being held against a $500 guarantee, according to a report from the KTUU.

The site is charged with three crimes in Class A, which means that it could be sentenced to a prison for up to one year and had to pay $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with crimes in Class B, which is punished with one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The issue is now being treated for the Alaska donor court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of preventing the notification of domestic violence, and of carrying weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend has claimed that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of donors in 2016 after she taught a distressing disorder about her son’s violent behavior, following his military service in Iraq.

Prosecutors seek a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attacker in New York City
New York prosecutors want the death penalty imposed on Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of having participated in a terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for crimes against federal law since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, is thought to have taken Home Depot to rent to attack people on a bike path along the road West Side Highway in the lower part of Manhattan. He drove down there walking and riding road users in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the victims of eight “willfuls” and cause serious physical injuries “willfuls”, according to the declaration that death penalty, recorded in the New York Southern Court.
Both of these prosecutors may lead to a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Many weeks after the attack, the U.S. federal court accused Saipov of 22 teams, including eight charges of murder for a criminal purpose, usually used by the prosecutors in charges against organized crime, and Saipov was also accused of violent crime and of destroying the vehicle.
The attack included “a considerable planned showup,” the prosecutors declared Sapiov’s actions as “fearful, cruel, and immoral. ”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov became responsible for physical injury, damage and loss to family and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, ” says in the statement of will.
Five victims were travelers from Argentina.
A decade ago, New York City’s last trial of death took place.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, who were eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in a New York court case in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being convicted of spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, the couple were killed in the electric chair.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no sign of repentance during the days and months after the attack, according to legal documents.
He told a detective that he was doing well, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he had the idea of the attack after watching videos from ISIS on his phone, as stated in the charges.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, said the police.
He has declared his innocence in all 22 aspects of the charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s official guards, said that they were “of course disappointed ” by the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to ask for a death penalty rather than to accept a declaration of guilt against life imprisonment without the possibility of a trial settlement will only extend the injury caused by this event to all residents,” said Patton.
The defenders of Saipov's had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek a death penalty.
According to a member of the House, NIGEL FARAGE should conduct negotiations for Brexit.
Nigel Farage promised to “work the people’s army ” today in protest at the conservatives ’ conference.
This former leader, Ukip, said that politicians had to “vent pressure” from skeptics around the EU, at the same time as one of Theresa May's Senators suggested that he should conduct the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative Peter Bone told the Birmingham protest march that Britain was “outgoing” now if Mr. Farage was the leader of Brexit.
However, the challenge that May faces in putting up with a deep dispute between her own staff was even more evident as guardians who wish to remain in the EU participated in other protests against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has difficulty keeping Chequer's plan on track and is critical of those who are in favour of Brexit, those who are opposed, and the EU.
The Allies claimed that she will continue to fight to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the opposition and pressure of those opposed to Brexit and the Workers’ Party to choose between her plan and “indecent. ”
Mr. Bone said to the Leave Means Leave Protestant march in Solihull that he wanted to “lost the Chequers plan. ”
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been allowed to take part and take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“ If he were at the government, we would have gone out now, ” he said.
The congressman from Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit, but we must get rid of the Chequers plan."
He explained his opposition to the EU, saying: “We do not fight in world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone referred to evidence that the public opinion had changed from the 2016 election: “The idea that the British public changed their view and wants to remain is completely untrue. ”
Andrea Jenkys, a conservative member of Brexit’s protest campaign, said to reporters: “I just want to say: ‘ Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequer’s plan is unpopular among the public, and the opposition will not vote with it, using an enemy among our sects and activists on the streets to vote for us.
Please stop the Chequers plan and start listening."
In direct messages to May, she added: “The prime ministers keep the job when they keep their promises. ”
Mr. Farage said that politicians would have to “vent pressure ” if they were to compromise the decision taken following the 2016 vote.
“ This is now about trust between our party of people and our political party, ” he said.
“ They want to try to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell them, “We will not let you get away with this.”
In his messages to the crowds, he added: “I want you to put pressure on your political party, which is about to be betrayed by Brexit.
We make public armies in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we have become independent, self-controlling, proud Great Britain."
At the same time, EU protesters went to Birmingham, which ended with a two-hour protest meeting in the city.
A small group of activists waved the flag of the against Brexit guards after the group was set up this weekend.
Lord Adonis, of the Workers ’ Party, made fun of keepers because of security problems that occurred in the group telephone program when the convention was opened.
“ This is the people who tell us that it can have all the computer systems right and all the technologies for Canada plus, for without barriers, for free trade with Ireland without borders, ” he added.
“ This is a real scandal.
There's no such thing as Brexit," he said.
Warren is going to “take a serious interest ” in presenting himself to the presidency.
Elizabeth Warren, U.S. Senator of the Senate, claims that after the November election, “a serious offer to the Presidency ” would be considered.
A report from Boston Globe says that the Massachusetts Democratic talked about his future at a civil meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has indisputed Donald Trump President of the United States, volunteers for re-election in November against the Republican Geoff Diehl, co-director of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the center of her suspicion that she could offer herself against Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting in the form of a civil meeting with residents in her district, since Trump took office.
One of the guests at the meeting asked her if she was planning to volunteer to the president.
Warren replied that it was time “for women to go to Washington and take control of our government, and then a woman as a leader also needs to be. ”
Arrest after fatal shooting at Sims from LSU
The Baton Rouge police announced on Saturday that she had arrested one suspect in LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who was shot to death on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police reported on the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years at a news conference at 11 a.m.
She had previously released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man on the tape.
Sims, aged 20, was shot to death near Southern University university early on Friday.
“Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in his head and died because of it,” said Sheriff Murphy J. Paul at the press on Saturday, a report from 247 sports.
Wayde came to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to having been on the scene, with weapons on his way, and admitted to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested in a trouble-free manner and arrested by the Eastern Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was two feet tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, he played in 32 games, of which 10 in the beginning of the last season and played on average 17.4 minutes, scored 5.6 points, and reached 2.9 yields per game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after Sebastian Vettel gives him the victory seat following their command.
It was evident from the time Valturi Bottas reached a seat in front of Lewis Hamilton before the start of Saturday, that orders from the Mercedes team would play a big part in the contest.
Bottas got off to a good start and almost left Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two turns and offered Vettel to fight against his teammates.
Vettel went first to the pit and let Hamilton drive into the traffic at the end of the group, which should have been able to handle the finals.
The Mercedes car went into the pit one lap later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton emerged from a conflict where Ferrari driver was forced to leave the inner gate after he was at risk of being left behind, after defense attempts in the third corner.
At the end of his first cycle, on his 21st birthday, Max Verstapp began in the rear of the group and was in seventh place.
He then led the majority of the competition as he postponed changing tires to try to finish quickly and leave Kimi Raikkonen and reach fourth place.
He finally went to the pit at 44th circle but could not increase the speed of the eight remaining circles, and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri stood by himself all weekend and was a true gentleman to let me out.
The team has been great enough to achieve this success," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday, because of her claim that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, with an accusation against Brett Kavanaugh, a designated Supreme Court judge, about sexual harassment.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but he did not speak directly about the Ford testimony before the Senate Committee, but he said that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were “bad and cruel and untrue. ”
“ The only thing that could happen and the wonderful things that have been going on in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and cruel and untrue, ” he said.
“ When you see the publications and leaks and then they say, “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, are you sorry?
Remember her answer....
Oh, no.
I don't feel it."
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't lie down," he said and copied the senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where the charges made by Ford against Kavanaugh were lodged early in September. Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
“I didn’t hide the accusations of Dr. Ford, I didn’t like her story,” said Feinstein to the committee, according to a report from The Hill.
“ She asked me to keep it in her faith, and I did as she asked me to. ”
But her denial didn’t seem to go well down in the president, who said at the Saturday session: “I tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't look at it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued his defense of Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women, and suggested that the Democrats were taking advantage of the charges.
“ They are determined to regain power, no matter what methods are needed.
You see the cruelty, the wickedness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to take over in order to gain power and control," said the President, according to a report from Mediaite.

The flight manager is dying to ensure that hundreds of passengers on an airplane escape from an earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero after he died to ensure that an aircraft with hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
More than 800 people have died, and many have been missed after a major earthquake over the island of Sulawesi on Friday and followed by a wave of violence.
Large earthquakes continue to plague the area, and many are trapped under ruins in the city of Palu.
The 21 - year - old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, despite the fact that his associates had fled the government tower, which violently swinged at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pala.
He remained to ensure that the Batik Air flight number 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake hit, could certainly be aired.
He then jumped out of the bridge when he thought he was going down.
He died later in a hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman of Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision potentially saved hundreds of lives, according to a story from ABC News in Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to move it to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
“ We are very sad to hear, ” he added.
The authorities fear that the number of the dead could exceed a thousand, according to the country’s disaster agency, that access is limited to the towns of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong.
“The number of dead is still increasing, because many dead bodies are still being destroyed and cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, secretary of the Agency.
Up to six feet [6 m] tall centuries have caused tremendous destruction in Pala, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
The army and passenger planes are working to bring relief equipment and supplies.
A 35 - year - old mother, Kusuma, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance comes with a body.
There's little clean water.
The micromarkets have been robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross competes with survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it might get worse."
Joko Widodo, president of Indonesia, came to Pala on Sunday and told the country’s army: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the missions related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" said a story from CNN.
Earlier this year, earthquakes over Lombok in Indonesia, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini is now saying that after a plane crashed into a loon, there is a missing air accident in Micronesia.
After saying that all 47 passengers and crews had been rescued from the sinking aircraft, the airline, which had a plane falling into a loon in Micronesia, now says that one person was missing.
Air Niugini reported that from Saturday afternoon on, it did not know of the effect of one male passenger.
The airline said that he was working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water when she tried to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, representatives said that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in a hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and the precise sequence of events.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said that the plane had landed just a little before the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had gone too far across the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane's flight was very low.
“It was really good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others could water down the water and get to emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the flight crews were afraid and screaming and that he had suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that seamen who were at work a long time away from brewing also helped rescue by using an inflated boat to take people ashore, before the plane sank into about 30 feet [30 m] deep water.
Data from the Air Safety Agency show that 111 people have died in PNG-registered aircraft accidents over the past two decades, none of which were related to Air Niugini.
An expert describes the timeline of the evening that a woman was burned alive
The prosecutors closed their case on Saturday in the reopening of a case against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert from the U.S. Department of Justice, was in the courtroom for hours as an information - analysis expert.
He described to his belly how he used cell records to put together the journeys of the accused 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that he received location data from several cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to his previous statements, as reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When evidence showed that his cell phone was at Chamber at the same time as he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said that he had not been in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that it was “a lie, for my car was in Nashville. ”
Another disagreement was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Mobile data showed that they had only been known for one week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chamber's death, Tellis had deleted text messages, phone calls, and contact information from her phone.
“ He destroyed her from his life, ” said Hale.
It is estimated that the guards will give their final talk on Sunday.
The judge said that he would expect the matter to be brought before the courthouse later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip jump?
Hip hop trio wants to fight negative views of music by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hops have been removed from their origins, including political messages and social issues.
They want to look for the origin again and make consciously hip jump popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen recent fluctuations in Britain through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
In New York City, a New York girl and a married couple who have been expelled for a “prejudicated ” text message
In New York City, a New York girl, a married couple who were accused of illegal expulsion after she received an unexpected text message from her mother, complaining that she was “another black person. ”
So the couple refuse to be prejudiced and like the law of “destruction. ”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed displeasure when she learned that her new foetus, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first arrived for work in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Faxman wrote to her husband in text messages.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent them twice to Miss Maurice.
After discovering their mistakes, Plasco-Flaxman, Miss Maurice, said that their former foetuses, who were black, were doing bad and that she was expecting a Filipino woman, according to a report from the New York Post.
Miss Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home to Uber's car.
Maurice now sues her husband and wants compensation for the expulsion, that the amount of $350 a day was for the six month job she had originally been hired, although no contract was signed.
“ I wanted to show them that you shouldn’t do this, ” she told Post on Friday and added, “I know this is a difference. ”
The couple have objected to the allegations that they are prejudiced and that it was the right thing to fire Maurice, for they felt that they could not trust her after insulting her.
“ My wife sent her messages that she wasn’t going to say.
She's not prejudiced.
We are not prejudiced people," said the husband Joel Plasco to Post.
“ Who, though, would trust his children for someone after showing such rudeness, even though it was surprising?
His newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco likened the plea to “cushion, ” saying that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in“ very difficult situations. ”
“ Are you going to attack someone in this situation?
That's not very nice done," said Plasco, who works in the investment company.
The matter is still at stake, but the public has made a strong statement about the couple on social media and has ashamed of their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington’s publishers feared that readers would find it difficult to like a talking bear, says in a new letter.
Commenting on the letter, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was approved, Karen Jankel, said: “It’s hard to put herself in the footsteps of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
“ It’s very funny now that we know of the tremendous success of Paddington. ”
She said that her father, who worked as taken over by the BBC before he was inspired to write a children’s book about a small toy bear, had taken the rejection of his work with a calm positive attitude, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book was “loving ” after his death last year.
As to Paddington, whom she describes as “an important family member, ” she added that her father had been silently proud of his success eventually.
“ He was a very quiet man, and not used to brag, ” she said.
“ But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child who does something, you’re proud of it even if you didn’t really do anything yourself.
I think that's the way he looked at Paddington's success.
Even though Paddington was creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington himself credit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye through the phone
By the time she landed, her daughter had been transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 of the hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but without success.
“Nad regularly called and told me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Later, Nad called me and said that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given her to maintain her heart rate were gradually losing their effectiveness and getting out of the body.
She had died shortly before, and that was the body giving up.
I had to sit there waiting, knowing this was all happening.
I couldn’t make or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to be in control."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned her dead daughter, went aboard the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the difficulties she experienced.
“ No one knew anything, ” she said.
“ I took my head off, and my tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt very sympathetic to Nad.
That he would need my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Suffering women hang up messages to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who had a loved one who committed suicide are now trying to prevent others from taking their life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey have posted messages on a bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and phone numbers that people can call and get help.
Dr. Davis’s son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide when he was 18.
“ I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day, ” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, living in Lyney, said that her son had been a successful cook with an infectious smile.
“ He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could light up any room."
He stopped working before his death, for he was “caught down into a very dark place. ”
In 2014, Brother Tyler, at the age of 11, found his brother dead after taking his own life.
Dr. Davis said: “I am constantly worried that it will be followed. ”
Miss Davis made the message “to let people know you can go talk to others, even friends.
Don't sit and say nothing--you need to talk to someone."
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Ms. Davies for years, lost her spouse, Mark, to 15 years of age, shortly after his mother died.
“ He didn’t talk about his suffering or being depressed or anything like that, ” she said.
“ A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his temper.
He was on his worst on Christmas Day – when the children opened their gifts, he did not look in their eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a shock to them, but that they had to work out: “This tearing hole in the family.
It's gonna tear us apart.
But we must continue and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs on a thread when the FBI has its investigation
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for - study with a limited amount of time and scope - maybe we could get a little contented,” said Mr. Fllake on Saturday and added that he feared that the committee was to “interrupt” in the middle of a conflict between the groups where everything was in reverse.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his sponsors from the Republican Party want the FBI to investigate this?
Their limitations are due to the timing.
If the Republicans fail, as expected, their serious efforts to get their husband elected to sit in the highest court of the land will be weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling senators to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and met his wife, Ashley, through him, who was the secretary-general of Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishs its research report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit at the same time.
It is not yet certain whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, but that would enable the Vice President Mike Pence to break up the equation and confirm it in the office of the Supreme Court.
The number of those fleeing North Korea “reduces” under Kim’s command
The number of those fleeing North Korea and going to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korea Senator.
Park Byeong-Seug, quoted data from South Korea Joint Council, saying that 1127 people fled last year, compared with 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border protection between North Korea and China, and higher charges driven by smugglers with people were key elements.
Pyongyang has not published any official declaration.
The vast majority of those fleeing North Korea are invited to a South Korean citizenship right.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, over 30,000 people from North Korea were illegally crossing the border.
Most people flee to China, but it has the longest border to North Korea, and it is easier to cross it than the best cover for the neutral area between North and South Korea.
China views the refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, often forcing them to return to its homeland.
Interconnection between North and South Korea, which is still at war, has improved considerably over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met at Pyongyang for discussion, which focused mainly on the protracted negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This was after a historic meeting in June between the President Donald Trump of the United States and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed grossly to work together towards a nuclear-free Korean crisis.
On Saturday, however, Ri Yong Ho, Foreign Secretary of North Korea, taught American business prayers for lack of progress since then.
“With no confidence in the United States, there is no evidence of the security of our country, and under such circumstances it is impossible that we take down our nuclear weapons alone first,” said Ri in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “motherly sick ” and says he is unfit for the Supreme Court’s work.
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the Congress of the Minority, called Brett Kavanaugh, called the Supreme Court Judge “Mother’s Disease, ” and said that he was too proud to be able to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made those remarks happen on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had ever acted like this, she would have been called a mother’s disease,” said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, who was both young, denied with a strong feeling that he had harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually.
In his opening talk, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and at times ran away from it, and he had a cake in his throat when he talked about his family and his school years.
He also publicly condemned the Committee’s democrats and called the charges on him “abominable and organized genocide ” organized by liberals who were angry at the loss of President Clinton’s election in 2016.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not work at the Supreme Court, for he showed that he was partial to the democracies.
“I think these statements and how he attacked the Clintons and Democrats show that he is unfit for the job,” she said.
Pelosi did not respond when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh fired if confirmed and if Democrats reach a majority of the council.
“I’ll say this: if he’s not telling the council or the FBI the truth, he’s not only unfit to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is now,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is now serving as judge at the Washington D.C. appeal court.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about the potential decisions of Kavanaugh against the HCP Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he is considered to be a conservative judge.
During the hearing, Kavanaugh asked questions as to whether he would reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“ This is no time for a motherly sick, partial person to go to the highest court and expect us to say, “It’s wonderful.”
And women need to take advantage of it.
It is a just saying, months and years of fury flowing out of it, and it does not come out of it without weeping.
“ We cry when we get angry, ” said Miss Steinem to me 45 years later.
“ I don’t think it’s uncommon, but you? ”
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she cried too when she was angry, but she had developed technology so that when she was angry and started to cry, she said to her interviewer,“ You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was great fun."
Tears are allowed to express anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my most clear memories of my former job, which I conducted in an office with men in the majority, as I began to cry out of rage that I could not express, came an older woman, and grabbed into my neck’s belly. She was a cold boss that I had always feared a little and she pulled me into a stairwell.
“ Never let them see you cry, ” she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think that you are sad and glad that you have come in."
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart when he was serving as president, then a councilman of Democrats from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in cheating aboard a boat called Monkey Business (Apaspil), and withdrew his offer, Miss Schroeder, thought there was no reason why she could not consider offering herself to the president.
“ It wasn’t a well - thought - out decision, ” she laughed to me 30 years later.
“ There were already seven other candidates, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone gave this name “War White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since the campaign was long over, it was after what had happened to a fundraiser, so she vowed not to volunteer unless she would be able to collect $2 million.
There was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“ Do they think that I am getting a discount? ” she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not offer herself formally, she was so overcome by feelings--thankful to the people who had supported her, resentment toward the system, which made it so difficult to raise money, and direct her sight to voters instead of representatives, and anger into the gender difference--that she burst into tears.
“ You might think I had a nervous breakdown, ” said Miss Schroeder when she recalls how the media responded.
“ It might seem that Cleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my uterine stone?

Reasons for Business Wars Between the United States and China could be good for Beijing
The first rounds of the trade war between the United States and China were adrift, and although the war is far from over, the gap between countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, took the first warning shot earlier this year by taxing China’s major export goods, including solar charges, steel, and aluminium.
This week’s peak came with new tolls that cover worth $200 billion ($150 billion) worth of goods, taxing as much as half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Peking has responded in the same coin every time and recently put 5 to 10 percent toll on American products worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the U.S. Tolls, and it is unlikely that another major economy in the world will come to an end.
To get Washington to hoof needs to give in to demands, but it would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, president of China, to bend himself publicly from the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing holds the cards properly, pressure from the commercial war with the United States could have a positive effect on China in the long run, reducing the mutual need for both economies for each other.
“The fact that either Washington or Beijing’s political decision could lead to economic collapse in either country is actually much more dangerous than the viewers have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, an investigator who focuses primarily on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria “ready ” for refugees to return, says Foreign Secretary
Syria claims to be ready for refugees to return to the country and seek assistance to rebuild the country, now in a bad condition after seven years of war.
Walid al Moualem, Foreign Secretary, spoke to the UN General Assembly and said that conditions in the country improved.
“ Today, ” he said, “the conditions on earth are down constantly and safely, thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism. ”
The government continues to establish normal conditions by building up areas destroyed by terrorists.
Everything is now ready for refugees to return to the land they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the one - sided economic decisions directed against their daily lives and jobs.
THE nation estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled from the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million more who still live in the land need help.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian authorities would be happy to take help in rebuilding the country.
However, he stressed that they would not accept assistance on the basis of conditions or aid from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe has won the Ryder Cup 2018 by winning the United States team with a final result of 16.5 versus 10.5 points at the Le Golf National field outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when the team, led by the Danish leader Thomas Bjorn, reached 14.5 points to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had difficulties most throughout the race, struck his initial blow into the water at the 16th hole, a couple of 3, and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone brightly in all his games and became 1 out of 4 players to get the result 5-0-0, since the competition began to use its current format in 1979.
United Statesman Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 against Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, who was at the bottom of the order of the European team.
Dustin Johnson, who is at the top of the list of the best golfers in the world, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who was potentially playing in his last race for the Ryder Cup.
The Spanishman Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times around the Ryder Cup, became the winner of the race at 25.5 square points.
“ I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t.
It's been a difficult year.
I am so grateful Thomasi that I had chosen me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
This is about the team, and I was pleased to be able to help," said the emotional Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He hands his country John Rahm to the torch, who won the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a solo game on Sunday.
“I was incredibly proud to have conquered Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him,” said 23 - year - old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of their games in France and is now registered with 13-21-3 in the race for Ryder.
This is a strange conclusion for one of the best players in history, who has won 14 great titles and is only in second place after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team found it hard all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played a good game throughout the race.
The leader of the U.S., Jim Furyk, said after disappointment with his team’s performance, “I am proud of them, they fought.
It was at some point in the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him.
I'll cover for Thomasi.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players play very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with PGA, U.S.A., and called the Ryder Cup, and we'll continue.
I love these 12 men and am proud to be their leader.
You gotta take it off.
They played better than us."
