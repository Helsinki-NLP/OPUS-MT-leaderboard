Crying for the World
The market campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland I think it's a good start, and shouts and calls out in nature are starting to pull people wide and wide around the world.
“You’re in your mind, I need Iceland,” says one woman in the big world in comments about an advertisement from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland of YouTube.
Another observer says he will keep Iceland in her heart for all eternity, and a young woman claims that she must get there as soon as Iceland’s fiance is settled.
On the other hand, she is in the United States, assuming that she would have to wait another month.
Another observer asks if the route to Iceland is available, because there are no planes.
It doesn't follow the story of whether he's from another time zone.
Egill Thorddarson of Peel’s advertising centre, which was created by M&C Saatchi’s international advertising facility, says the reception has been more hopeful.
“ I came to many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well, but this new campaign has already begun to hit.
Basically, this is about creating PR values, it's getting foreign media to deal with the campaign, and it's been amazing.
In a relatively short period of time, we have been given a discussion of some seven hundred media around the world, which totals over two billion people.
The value of this discussion is valued at $1.8 billion.
It's not that bad."
The main market is all the same as the United States, and the campaign has gone very well, although Americans are not on their way to the country’s prey.
According to Egil, a well - known market area, such as Denmark, Britain, and Germany, has also been welcomed by one Russian country, which is a pleasant surprise.
Then there was an reaction from foreign areas, such as India, which was not specifically addressed.
“ These ads have traveled far beyond our expectations, ” says Eric, who may have watched over four million people on YouTube.
“ We couldn’t have wished for a better start. ”
On the open, the photographer of the Morning Press, Årni Såberg, took the photos on the cover of the headline “Let It Out ” in the middle of the last month.
The roofs went wide and wide, such as in Reykjavik, in the mountain of Reykjavik, in the mountain of Skovgarfos, in the ice sheet, and in a cave by the Cape of Hjorp.
The directors were Samuel Bjarki Peter's son, and Gunnar Paul Olaf's son at Scoti productions and taken by Ottar the son of God.
The roles provided included the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, from Cuba and Hungary.
While dozens of people from Iceland came to make the ads, at the same time as recordings took place in the South, another group in the West and West countries.
According to Egil, “Let It Out” is only the first member of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but a winter campaign is scheduled for cooperation with M&C Saatchi.
“ This is just the first phase of this work for Iceland’s office,” says Egill, adding that the cooperation with M&C Saatchi was extremely successful.
“ Working with them is great.
For such projects, it is important to have foreign partners with the knowledge of the limits we are talking to."
Explosive sands: Raising the position on the labour market, pension funds and many more
Ásmundur Einar Dadason, Minister for Social Affairs and Children's Affairs, will be attending Bombisand, which starts at 10 p.m. today.
He is also Minister of Labour and discusses the position on the labour market as such, the Icelandair case, and other issues.
He also discusses land - and - land transport to a land that has gone badly and has been controversial over the past few years and decades.
Ragnar Thor Ingölvsson, president of VR, will also be present, but he will discuss his criticisms about the investment of pension funds, and he suggests ideas that labor movements and employers will withdraw from the fund's governance in order to reduce the risk of conflict of interests.
Then Ivar Ingimarsson, an Austrian tourist servant, and Jonansdóttir, the Director-General of the Nordic Market Office, will be discussed with them.
They will look forward to the fall and wonder if the success of summer is a misleading order for what to happen.
You can listen to the show below, but it starts at 10:00.
That's what she looks like 25 years later.
The actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in youth of all kinds.
At home, however, she was given her game as Amber in the movie Clueless 25 years ago.
She also played in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch along with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married to one child.
Its view has taken place recently, but it led her to look over the road and to express herself on Clueless in a Australian television on the days.
She speaks beautifully of Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
“ I have to admit that I was mostly based on girls I met at school who were not good to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who that person was," said Donovan about his play at Clueless.
Didn't want to leave the police station after a night shift
About 50 cases came in, including the police in the capital city area today, and the police journal says that there were a wide variety of cases.
The day at the local police station began with the fact that the police had to interfere with a man who had been recently released from a prison cell after staying there because of drunk driving.
If the man did not want to go away after he was released, he did not obey the instructions of a police officer who told him to leave.
The man made continued stay at the police station because of his conduct.
Then, this morning, a man was arrested for burglary into a company in Kopavogi.
The police also had to intervene with two men in Breðholti because of a report of assault.
Then, too, a woman sitting in a shopping mall in Kopavogi could not pay for the account at the end of a meal and was called to the police.
Also reported on the car was stolen in downtown town this morning.
For a moment, a white driver named Renault was looking out for her, and she was taken for free.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the Joyry - The Terrorical Destiny of the Golden Stars
The online theory of a curse has passed over the series of events around the Joy Corps, but Naya Rivera’s actress drowned in California during the days, thereby becoming the third of the major actors in the process of making life a long way before age.
Glee is a popular series of songs, dances, and joys.
The nations covered the so - called happy youth class in high school, their love for them, and their fate.
While singing and dancing did not always seem to overwhelm any circumstances that arose in their lives.
But outside the scene, the players and the employees of the show have suffered so great adversities, so much so that theories have awakened that they are being cursed.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez, a cheerleader who didn’t call all her grandmothers.
After the process had run, Rivera took the actor Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and then separated.
Dorsey, though, refused to file a complaint, and the domestic violence was dropped.
On July 8, the last one was announced that Rivera was missing after her four - year - old son was found alone in a drift in a boat on Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket on board the boat and was able to tell the police that he and his mother had run to swim and then Rivera would have brought him back to the boat but never returned to the boat himself.
A massive search for Rivera began.
The day after the search began, the chief of police in the area reported that we had been searched for because Rivera drowned.
Five days later Rivera was found and was officially decided to die.
It is thought to have been in heavy water and to have used her last request to save her son.
Cause of death was reported drowning of accidents.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the show, the American footballer with the angel death, who played a key role in bringing the Joy Party to glory and respect.
Yet, outside of the show, Moneith wrestled with personal demons.
Since 13 years of age, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape.
In 2013, his colleagues in the series felt enough, intervened, and encouraged him to seek help.
Then Moneith went into treatment and seemed to be looking at a better way.
Only two months after his treatment was completed, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Banamone was a lethal mixture of substance and alcohol.
No willful actions were considered.
Moneith had been treated and his tolerance for drug transfusions had been reduced so much that the dose he had previously tolerated was fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was heavy on his associates, but his opposite wife, Lea Michele, was determined to continue taking the part and to devote them to the entire memory of Moneith and his character Exists.
Mark Wayne Salling took the role of Noah “Puck” Puckerman in the show, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow members of the Joystod, or until he was discouraged to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested in his home in Los Angeles for child - pornography custody.
At his home, a huge amount of child pornography was found, and the matter soon became public.
It was obvious that Salling had already been.
He was accused and convicted of his transgressions.
He had four to seven years ’ imprisonment in addition to the fact that he would need to be on the record of sex offenders and seek the treatment of childishery.
Before the judge had determined the penalty, Salling, then released from bail, was found dead near his home.
Cause of death was suicide.
It wasn't just the actors who fell from an early age.
Jim Fuller was an assistant director of the show.
In 2013, he fell asleep, only 41 years old.
The show also worked for a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was a younger sister of the superstar Julia Roberts, who did not bring the beautiful story to her sister, but she accused Roberts of much control and disrespectful behavior.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she struggled with major depression.
She left a letter to her fiancé, where she told her mother and sisters, among other things, responsible for what happened to her.
“ My mother and my so - called siblings will have nothing left for me but the memory that they were the ones who caused my worst depression. ”
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of using her fellow actors to bullies and crossings at the scene and of being a superstar.
Jesse Luken took a guest role in the program in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which thought much scandal.
The actress Heather Morris played a major role in the activities.
It happened in 2010 that unpopular computer criminals came into her nude pictures and appeared on the Internet.
The actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner played both in the show and in an affair outside the show.
Benoist later reported that Jenner used violence in her relationship.
You can put flowers on almost all
When children get to play outdoors with their parents to grow flowers and to watch them grow and grow, they grow.
It is also endlessly possible to make flowers as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having a little time with your kids in the park is something that will never be forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance, and, of course, the precious time that they have received with their parents.
Bought a boat after the tenth grade
“I don’t think we’re many sailors working at the country’s plaything schools,” says Axel Örn Gudmundsson, who is fishing for the summer but who is a psychiatrist at the Icelandic University of Denmark during the winter season.
Beach fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you are studying.
If you fish well, you can have good income, and I think it's great to be able to avoid taking the study loan.
The patterns also do me good in the winter," says Axel Örn Gudmundsson, 25-year-old psychiatrist, who is fishing for the summer like the previous summer.
Axel had recently docked at Tálnnafir when a journalist reached his speech late to evening at the beginning of the week."
“ I took command of boats less than 40 feet [12 m] long and bought my boat in the summer after finishing the primary school.
I've been fishing on my boat every summer since.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, the son of John, and I named it his name.
Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and stopped at sea, and he was very happy when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat," Axel says, adding that he bought the boat in three million.
“ I made a contract with Hartmann to pay half a million and a half at the beginning of the summer, but the other half at the end of the summer when I had fished.
I therefore had the boat without debt at the end of this first summer on him."
How, though, could a boy have one and a half million to pay into a boat after he had just finished high school?
“ I had set up and collected money, I had been working with my dad at sea when I was a boy, I was all sick of hunting with him and got my share.
I also put my money in my boat's fund."
Axel was born in Isafird, from where all his mother's people have lived, but he has lived in Kopavogi since he was a boy.
“ I can hunt here in the west because I have a legal home at my grandmother’s Isafide.
I learned from this area on the west side of rowing with my dad.
I move from place to place, depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers the entire West.
Although I think it's best to be west, I've also given around snowflakes and other things.
I've also given for the south, but preferably for the gray,' says Axel, who always grabs one fire in the morning and says that he sometimes speaks to gullets and sings to the sky, in the loft for hours in the baller's ocean.
“ The environment in the ocean is good, so I can call, listen to programs and music.
I don't like being on my own.
Of course I try to avoid being in danger, but certainly sometimes something has been that weather, but never much danger," says Axel, who is lucky with the fact that he is never seasick.
He says the length of the day of work depends on how the fishing works.
“ In coastal fishing, I never spend more than 14 hours fishing at once, but I have also been fishing in other systems, such as in the rental zone, which means that I have been fishing continuously for one and a half days on the seaside. ”
He says that the structure of coastal fishing is such that he can catch 770 kilograms a day, which he feels to be inhibiting.
“ Other restrictions are that I may not catch Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and I may only catch twelve days a month, during the four months of beach fishing, in May, June, July, and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their hunting days according to weather and nothing else.
Instead of having 48 days throughout the summer, these unnecessary pressure is needed and may choose for their own heads.
So could the region change go by, too, and the TV lock that is well positioned with fishes should enjoy it," says Axel, who takes most of the drier out of the salty sea on his beach fishing, but also only a few and some other rivers.
Axel works during the winter season with the University School of Nupi, Kopavogi.
“I don’t think we’re many sailors working at the country’s playgrounds,” says Axel proudly, adding that he was only planning to work temporarily at the school.
“ I get stuck there because I think this wonderful work is a wonderful thing to do.
I hope that I will be able to benefit from psychology at the future school level," says Axel, who also has a long way to study business.
A bug in the registration prevented a returnhadow from recording
An error in a register form that people fill out when they arrive in the country caused a person living here to not be called back in a sample.
The identification number is not required if the person fills the form in English, as is the case when it is done in Icelandic.
“ This will be examined this week, ” says a surgeon’s health specialist.
Three internal infections were detected in the Land Hospital’s virology department yesterday.
One of those who proved positive came to the country on July 15, two days after the rules of a so - called return plot came into force.
The residents of Iceland are then screened at arrival to the country and again announced at demonstration four to five days later.
However, it appeared in the noon news of RUV that the person had applied the old system.
The sample on the border was negative and was not called back in the screening for the virus.
Kamilla Ruth Sigfusdóttir, a surgeon’s specialist in the field of protection, says that this is a result of an error in the electronic registration sheet.
If people fill out the registration page in English, they are not required to enter a social security number as in the Icelandic version.
In the end, it has been thought primarily for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person has not been automatically invited to display.
Kamilla, however, says that many people have followed the rules on home invasion although they have filled the registration form in English, and in some cases employers have also been alert to send people back to show after they arrived in the country.
“ This will be examined in the week how to make it easier for people to make this possible to draw their attention to the process. ”
The man is in isolation, and six have been put in a hospital.
They all go to sample, but two of them had already shown symptoms.
Shrinking is now in progress with the three infections that were diagnosed yesterday, which are mostly complete by the two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, the sequencing of the Icelandic genetic analysis has revealed that there have been non-previous variants of the crown virus.
In the second case, the bonds have been directed to Israel, although it is known that the person who moved the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be tomorrow when the other virus was coming.
A total of 15 are now in isolation according to the web COVID. ice.
135 are in sick leave.
Four out of five non-linked infectious diseases
Five domestic infections have been diagnosed here in the past few days.
Of these, four alphas are unconnected and are not to be found the source of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup sports event yesterday.
I'm sorry, I'm afraid it's still up to you.
Originally, in the third dozen individuals, they were sent to the hospital, which was reduced to sixteen.
Overall, 34 people are sick because of these new infections that were diagnosed yesterday.
This is a second time during a short period of exposure to a sporting event, and it has raised questions about whether such events should be maintained.
Jonn K. Jonnsson, Vice President of the National Police Department, says it slowly, as long as people follow standards and regulations.
“ We are constantly invigorating all those who live here that individual protective measures are needed.
We also need to remind people who are observing events that there are certain rules that need to be applied.
It's possible to keep an event," says Johan.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by maintaining individual protective measures.
In addition, rules and criteria are in constant review.
“ What needs to be done, and what the Public Protection Department and the Agricultural Health Department are constantly strengthening, is considering these individual protective measures.
Both at home and then at service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
It prevents the infection from going on," says Jonn.
“ We need to urge people to continue on the good journey we were on in order to maintain the success that we have achieved here to grace. ”
40% of the victims of COVID-19 had diabetes mellitus 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how difficult her father was to catch his breath.
Her father was diabetic, so she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day, he was dead.
Death was caused by sudden breathing difficulties caused by coronary virus infection.
Diabetes mellitus was identified as an underlying problem and Brumfield, also suffering from diabetes, is terrified that the same would happen.
Reuters reporter says the fear of Brumfield is not unfounded.
The figures for a new U.S. government study show that less than 40% of those died with diabetes mellitus 2 as the underlying disease.
When the percentage of those who had not reached the age of 65 years is examined, the proportion increases to half.
A study by the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) included more than 10,000 people in 15 countries who died from the crown virus during the February to May period.
Jonathan Wortham, CDC expert on infectious diseases, says the results are striking, especially for those diagnosed with diabetes mellitus 2 and their loved ones.
Was hidden in slow growth of Reuters had the survey done, pointing the answers from the 12 countries that responded to similar proportions.
10 states, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet identified underlying diseases.
“ Diabetes was already an epidemic of slow growth.
Now, COVID—19 has broken through like a powerful age," Reuters of Elbert Huang, head of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at Chicago University.
Diabetes mellitus is more common among blacks and people of South American origin, who have also gone worse out of the crown virus.
One of the best defenses for diabetics 2 is to control the disease by exercise, healthy diet, and health care professionals.
However, the Corona virus epidemic has made it difficult for many people to keep on a bus.
In this way, high prices of insulin have been used to keep coming to work, thereby stopping exposure to the virus.
Reuters points out that the U.S. authorities may have been aware of the risks of the virus caused by those with diabetes.
By the time the SARS chronic virus crossed in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease and by the 2009 swine flu epidemic, this group had a three times higher risk of hospitalization.
When MERS did so in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to intensive care had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because the effects of the COVID-19 virus could longer have been removed from the cover of many previously unknown complications.
“ I fear that we will see a flood of problems when this is over,” says Andrew Bolton, chairman of an international diabetic organization.
Doctors have warned that the coronary virus epidemic may lead to an increase in diabetic complications, including renal disease and renal dialysis.
Similarly, new studies are being conducted to help the crown virus cause an increase in the incidence of diabetes.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the connection between the crown virus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lung, and kidney, organs that are already ill in many people with diabetes.
Then a high proportion of glucose and lipids in diabetic patients can cause a true “cell signalworm” as called when your immune system is too hard and attacks your body.
Corrupted epithelial cells may also lead to inflammatory formation, which may lead to fatal blood clots.
“ This is one big puzzle,” says Dela Cruz.
“ It’s all connected. ”
The message has been corrected.
“We were invited to champagne, and then they left the room”
Astrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason made the unusual request of the artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a job that the artist was putting up in Paris.
“ We loved each other, so it wasn’t complicated. ”
So atli Bollason never forgets when he first met his wife and mother, Ásrúna Magnúsdóttir.
“ I was very impressed with her.
It was, of course, just the release, but then I thought she was also inexorably cute.
And still I think," he says.
Ásrún remembers this, too.
“ I’m always hearing this story.
Last weekend alone," she says, who also attracted her husband at first encounter.
“ I felt and felt so excited around Atla, which I am fond of.
There's a lot going on and a lot going on, and I was attracted to it."
Atli says that he and his wife have stressed the importance of taking their own steps.
“ We don’t tie our bags to the same knots as our companions.
We avoid the ruin that we distinguish around us."
There may be a reason why they took the errand from Ragnar Kjartan's son, an artist of art, just happy, though most of all unusual.
“Christ Anna, our mutual friend, is in touch with us and asks if we can come to dinner with Ragnar’s wife, Ragga and Ragnar’s Ingi. ”
They accepted the offer, met the trio on Snaps, and had dessert wine, and each dessert.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans for an art show that he thought he would put up in Palais de Tokyo, Paris in the fall.
“ He had a series of things called Scenes from Western culture.
He described it in a simple way."
Ásrún says that he described the work as fatal and decadent late from the everyday lives of Westerners.
“ He had sketches of all the scenes he was about to shoot, and last he told us what he wanted to know about our interest in participating in. ”
The Senan that Ragnar asked the couple to participate in was to show love for young middle - class couples in a minimalist room.
“ These are intercourse with the beginning and the end,” says Atli.
The couple did not know much, though they knew of him, and he did, “but they knew us and felt fit for this.
They said that they did not want to advertise people.
They may have thought that they would not get the right people but people who would get the sense of sex from performing for others."
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn’t take long.
“ When we got out of Snaps, we said, ‘ Are we not only ready for this? ’
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist, and all his team," says Ásrún and Atli.
“ It’s about love and getting close”
Senan was taken up in a fine apartment on the Ground Street.
There was a very small film audience; taken, Ragnar, and a musician and a couple.
After the recording had been turned on, all the room left to wait in the car except Atli and Ásrún.
“ We didn’t decide how to be.
We were given some instructions, but we tried to forget time and place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
There was no game, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Ásrún.
But was that romantic?
“ Yes, it was a bit romantic,” says Atli and Ásrún.
“ We were invited to champagne before they left the room.
It was a little like vacationing on a fancy hotel in Paris."
The team was happy with the performance of the couple in their moving work.
“ When Tommi took a look at it, he cried, and it was so beautiful, ” says Atli.
“ It’s as much about love as it is about relations as it is about itself, ” says Ásrún.
The couple’s parents have seen the work, and Atli says that his mother heard the voice of the son of the Reykjavík Gallery and then realized that he was part of the work.
“ Then she turns around and starts thinking about it, ” says Atli.
“ Mom and Dad saw it in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone this way, but then Dad sends me a message, and he says, "It's nice to meet the little family in Palais de Tokyo," she breaks up Ásrún.
And will the participation in the work have deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atla?
“ At least we’re still together, so maybe it deepened something.
At least this deepened my relationship with the associated family," says Ásrún and laughs.
Asrún himself saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
“ I found it a little difficult not to be with you, but someone else, ” she says, turning to her husband.
“ But it was nice to see it, because it’s only one late in much bigger work, and when you saw it with the other effect, it’s really cool.
I could get a little bit out of it and I was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my stomach," says Ásrún, who was pregnant by the second child of the couple when the sedan was picked up.
“ It was just beautiful. ”
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Ásrúna and Atla in the romance stories of Raás 1.

5 years from 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, U.S. ambassador in Iceland, is in the flashlight of the press after CBS announced this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard in which he was afraid of his life.
However, it has not been arduous for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador here on land.
Since Carol Van Voorst’s resignation from the U.S. ambassador at the end of April 2009, the country has been undefiled for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst gave up office under peculiar circumstances, but Kastlight reported in 2009 that she should have received the Falkas.
On her way to a farewell meeting with the president of Iceland, she received a telephone call from the Presidential Office, saying that she would not be honored.
After disappearing from Iceland, she became involved in international relations with Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst’s successor arrived, in September 2010.
To some extent, Robert S. Connan had been appointed ambassador, but he did not.
Finally, Loius Ariega eventually served in the foreign ministry for decades.
Then, in the fall of 2013, he gave up the office of a ambassador in Guatemala.
Then another ambassadorless period was accepted.
In January 2015, Robert Barber, who had received the approval of the U.S. Council, came to work shortly after, but then no ambassador had been present for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed, not diplomat, but served as a lawyer and supported Barack Obama’s election campaign.
He gave up work as soon as Donald Trump received the Presidential office, January 20, 2017, as usual with a politically appointed ambassador.
Trump’s government was unusual to appoint both ambassadors and senior officials in the Washington system.
Two years passed, then, before the U.S. Council announced its meeting to ask him and confirm that he was a ambassador in Iceland.
In his testimony to Congress he said he never came to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who is dead, had been of a Dutch mountain broken.
Gunter is politically appointed, formerly a dermatologist in California, and has been prominent in the Jewish community of the Republican Jewish Coalition.
They were founded by the owner Sheldon Adelson, who Adelson is a keen supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but then there had been no ambassador in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, the longest for example in the country.
The reason is both how long Trump’s rule was to assign people to key office who, and in recent years, have been working for the U.S. Council of Ministers, including the confirmation of a ambassador in office.
Since 2009, there have been no ambassadors in Iceland for over five years.
However, this has not prevented projects by the embassy that opened up new Engagteig headquarters.
The operations are estimated to have cost some 6.5 billion, but the safety walls surrounding the building are surrounded by bulletproof glass in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have enough to fill the present ambassador’s sense of security because he is said to be afraid of his life and has wished for an armed bodyguard.
IBV’s former actor was racist in Iceland - “It was a mistake to come to Iceland”
Tonny Mawejje, former actor of IBV, claims to have been racist when he was in Iceland and that he regrets coming to that country.
This is shown in an interview with Tonny, who appeared on the Ugandan Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC, who played in Uganda’s top division.
In the interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time here in the country, but he played with IBV, Val, and Evolution in Iceland.
“ When I arrived in Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle like I used to play.
The captain of the team was in that position, but in addition he also had the trio number I wanted so I got neither of what I wanted," says Tonny, who played on the right edge of the season with IBV.
Among what Tonny is racism that he suffered in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when playing in Europe.
“ This happened once to me, but since I did not understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later, I heard about the matter, and then I asked my friend what it was all about.
He told me then that my opponent dropped racist charges on me after I took him out."
In 2014, Tonny went from Iceland to Norway, where he joined the Strait of Hauge.
There he says he made the mistakes he sees most after.
Tonny had not been able to get to the beginning team at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get to the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland for a loan, but he joined Val.
“ It was a mistake to return to Iceland for a loan.
I think that if I had been longer in Norway I would have had the opportunity I wanted," says Tonny, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway, he would probably get further.
He means that the loan to Iceland has done away with his dreams of becoming a major player in Europe.
Find a worm in a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, found an estimated 3.8 - foot - long black worm in a woman looking for it.
Doctors managed to pull the worm out with a lever.
A study revealed that parasites were present.
CNN will report.
The woman had a few days before eaten sashimi, which is thin meat.
The woman quickly recovered after the worm was removed, but parasites such as these are often in raw meat or fish.
After sushi ran to bed in the West, cases of parasites have increased, according to CNN.
Fear of the beginning of another wave in Europe
Spain is now in a focus of concern about the second wave of the crown virus in Europe, where governments have taken action to re-establish the spread of the crown virus epidemic.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, more cities than Barcelona, where the number of infections is increasing.
Another European country has also taken action in Spain because of an increase in infection, but in Britain, as in Norway, all have to go to Spain for sickness, and the French have been warned of travel to Spain.
The number of infections is also growing in France and Germany, where governments are trying to find a balance between the reduction of the virus and the restoration of the economy.
However, the situation in Europe is good compared to other parts of the world, but world-wide infections are increasing to 300 000 a day, with the highest rate of infection in America and South Asia.
Confirmed transmission is now 16 million worldwide, according to John Hopkins University's count, and deaths confirmed to be related to the virus are 644 thousand.
“ The Work of Moses ” finally has the right to enjoy its full potential
In front of Reykjavik Tol House, there's a big, deep hole.
On top of it are men with orange helmets.
There's also a big grave.
And more smaller machines.
The street is closed before traffic.
But the sidewalk is good, and many people now stand there and watch the art of millions of mascots — just as they have never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least that did not respect it.
Up until now, the job has been somewhat hidden, right in front of it was a parking lot that was always engulfed.
The people lay there, locked the car in a craze, and then started to do their business in the city.
The current recovery of the Security Agency is a guide to the “big and diverse public space” and the“ attractive city wreck. ”
The goal is to make the area comfortable and to allow a vision of a vision to be given to the Morphuse of Type Helgadóttir.
The front of the job will be a square, and where the area is well off at the sun, it is considered suitable as a dormant area for road users.
The work of art will be brightened and will now make the material enjoy itself better than ever during this 142 - square - foot [ 142 sq m] surface.
In the area will also be small “dubours, ” some kind of water sculptures that offer a game and give the area specific mysticism.
In this way, the improvements are described by Reykjavík City, which is being carried out with Vevin.
Watering plants, thermal plants, and electronics will be refurbished.
Many of them have come to their years, but school and cold - water laws have since 1925, so they have served people and businesses in downtown areas for nearly a century.
When the street is reopened after completion, cars can drive it around again.
But it will become a monopolistic street, and at the same time there will be more quiet and accessible spaces for walking.
In knowledge of Tollhus’s site on the Customs Director’s site, the house was introduced in 1971, its architect Gísli Halldorson.
Because their nests reached through the house, 250 square feet [250 square meters] of windowless walls came out to the street.
The building committee and architect agreed that such flats would adversely affect the overall street picture, if no special arrangements were made to adorn the house’s appearance.
Thus, individuals agreed to calculate by having a permanent work of art written there.
At that time, much went by the artist Gerd Helgadóttir, says in the summary.
If she had worked hard in mystic works in Germany and elsewhere, she would have done a lot of work.
It was decided to contact her first before deciding whether the work would be competitive.
Often it had been discussed that the work had to reflect life at the port, as the harbor had been life - giving Reykjavik since its construction.
When she was discussed with the artist, she had to grow up on such a task.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other help before returning from the country, where she would work on the suggestions abroad.
The time she decided to need was set aside, and when she returned home, she suggested a few suggestions for discussion.
Immediately, she was agreed to do the job.
At the same time, it was requested to make a comprehensive agreement with it and the famous art firm in Germany, Oidtmann’s brothers, who had long worked with them to set up famous works of art in many parts of Europe.
Contracts were accepted and performed under the arrangements of the brothers, who later arranged for the production of the Tol House.
The entire work was very well done, both of the two types of Helgadódur and Oidtman brothers, says in the summary.
Ever since then, it has proved to be an unscrupulous Icelandic weather.
It took about two years to do the work that was being done and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Tol House work was completed, only 47 years old.
Preparing to transfer more institutions to the country
Minister of Social Affairs' Ásmundur Einar Dadason declares that more public institutions will be transferred to land in the near future.
This was said by the minister of the episode Explosive at The Calvary at noon.
Recently it was announced that the National Institute of Housing and Human Resources will be moved north to Deadakrok in the fall of the year.
Six fire experts are working at the Agency, but none of them intend to follow the North Department and have criticised the fire and disease transportation.
“ I think we should take further steps in this regard.
I am preparing further steps in this regard.
Further transfer," said Ásmundur.
If he is convinced that the vast majority of the people want to see a greater distribution of public institutions throughout the country.
“I think it’s necessary to take further political decisions on public transport to land, as I was doing with the Housing and Human Resources Agency,” said Ásmundur, who also took examples of other organisations that have been relocated to land and was very important for communities in the country, such as the transport of the Food Agency to Selfos, the Land Measure Iceland to Akraness and unemployment insurance in Skaga beach.
All the primary from the second day of the Master's front
94. Iceland’s Free Sports Master’s Convention ended on Thorsværet in Akureyri today.
A few contrasts were set on the second day of the race.
An exciting competition in the women's spasm was calculated at Thorsvält, while Vigdís Jonsdóttir from FH placed Islandsmet at a spasm in 2014 until Elizabeth Rut Rúnarsdóttir from IR improved in May last year.
Vigdís won the Icelandic Food back earlier this summer and has been in a fantasy form up late, but she has tripled the Icelandic Food for summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been dealing with injuries and has not recovered today.
She had only one valid cast of five, cast 25,69 feet, far from her best.
Vigdis threw the longest of all today, or 60,08 feet [60,08 m] in her last attempt and, at the same time, set against her.
Islandsmet she set early in July is 62,69 meters and so she was quite different.
The second best attack of the day was by the Guðrún of Karitas Hallgrimsdóttir, which added its best result with a cast of 50,18 meters.
In a male group, the FH-ing Hilmar Örnsson, the Icelandic Methic, won a secure victory, which he threw 73,84 meters in his second caste and set against it.
Islandsmet, in the article, is 75,26 feet [75,26 m].
Guðni Valur Gunnason, Olympian, and Iceland’s Methre, won a ball tower at Thorsvält yesterday but today he competed in a roundabout, his main branch.
Islandsmet Väna Vals is 65,53 metres [65,53 m], and he threw the longest of nineteen,13 meters [59,13 m] today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalde Erlendsson threw the second most today, but he had one valid cast that worked in the second seat, 49.43 meters.
The Hagdis Sigurdóttir, a long - distance Icelandic Methic, won the long - jump contest with superiority, while the Hafdis jumped at a distance of 6,25 feet [6,25 m] a day that is less than 40 cm [40 cm] from Iceland’s Meth.
In women's 200-metre run, it was the IR God save Jonah Bjarnadóttir, who was the best hit in 24,04 seconds, and in the article it is 23.45 seconds.
In Akureyri, Godsaving Jonah won two gold prizes yesterday, in a 100 - meter [100 m] race, and in a 4 x 100 - foot [100 m] signal race, as well as today’s 4 x 400 - foot [400 m] signal race.
In a male group, Kolbeinn Height Gunnarsson from FH was the first target in the 200 - meter race in 21,57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Oliver Måna Samuel’s son from Årmann.
Like God’s rescue Jonah, Kolbein gained gold in the 100 metres yesterday as well as in the 400 - meter [400 m] race.
Can't get a fine for $7 million Bitcoin harvest
The Overtax Committee has rejected the claim of a tax researcher who demanded a fine on a person for disproportioning his financial statements that were made for the sale of the electronic coin Bitcoin.
The committee concluded that a tax researcher had failed to provide a clear explanation as to why it was necessary to fine a man.
The committee’s decision states that the tax researcher considered that the person’s situation is responsible for the material error of the tax sales due to the revenue years 2016 and 2017.
He would have underestimated his financial indices that were due to the sale of the electric coin Bitcoin of 27 million, either on a voluntary basis or by a marvelous carelessness.
The man's smitten town for his manners.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
However, in 2016, he made 27 million dollars ’ worth of electrical coins.
In 2009 and 2010, she would have been buried when both easy and unattended by a regular home computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the electrical coins, the tax made because of such sales was very vague and unpredictable.
It would have been possible to expect citizens to realize such tax arrangements.
He would not have avoided paying taxes from the harvest, and he would have recognized his property as a deposit on a currency account.
He would have been asked by both the experts and the governors about how this would be done but without success.
Then he thought it necessary to take into account that he was not born or raised in Iceland and had only lived here for several years when he began digging after Bitcoin.
So he would have been in a worse position than others to examine complex rules that the tax authorities would not have made a clear view of.
Thus, the man considered that his taxes for the two years of income would be re-declared and put under pressure, but otherwise he would not be punished.
Then he repeated that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes here in the country since 2012.
He would never have intended to escape his duties in a way that would not have been right.
The claim for a fine would be out of order and would put him in debt.
“ This man understands what football is, ” says a groom.
Andersen Willumsson's wedding wheel has been a great deal between the teeth of people but has also been a source of enthusiasm for the success of what's left of it with a Bite in the Pepsi Max section.
Blinks will be on fire tonight when they welcome IA live at State 2 Sport.
A fireman then takes out a ban because of four reminders during the season, so he doesn't show up with a new clip like in the games of summer so far.
He had written “bla, bl, b, ” on his head for the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
“ I don’t know exactly who he was answering with the payment, but speaking of character, this one was more trying in the game.
He didn't hide.
He wants to get the ball every single time and if there was someone going to equal this game then I thought he'd do it or make it up," said Gudmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max window, when it was thought that he would fight for Brynjolf.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
“ It is difficult sometimes to see his position.
He looks a little out on the left when it starts to feel at the game, but he has a very free roll in the team," said Hjörvar Hafledason.
Torkell Máni Petersson tells Brynjolf a real entertainer, and he rejoices to have such a colorful person in the department: “No one shares the fact that this is a character.
It's a fun dick and I love it with my hair, and being always ready to come and answer to interviews.
There's a lot of people busy with him who tell me that this man understands what football is.
“ I am a entertainer.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it."
The people are reading the interviews at Brynjolf, they are paying themselves in, and they are watching what's next on his hair.
This man is just a genius," said Moni.
A player in the KR says he wants to leave his partner - "I've been in contact with a few teams in the B section"
Tobias Thomsen, player at the Pepsi Max Division, seems to be leaving the team.
According to Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to go back to Denmark.
Football.net also reported on the case.
Tobias wants to get to the start of the period in his country, but for this he first has to cancel his contract with KR, where the Danish branch begins before the Icelandic odds.
The company knows I miss Danmerk and has shown me a great deal of understanding," said Tobias in a conversation with Bold.
“I’ve been in contact with a couple of the B division and will probably switch before the Icelandic period ends.
There aren't many teams in Denmark that can allow themselves to pay off my contract with KR."
Then he says that he probably has to face a reduction in his salary in Denmark.
“ In Denmark, ” she says, “people may have felt more of the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.”
Starflies Bjartmar has recovered a bicycle for millions - Answers now after the discussion of the DV
For over a year, Bjartmar Leosson has had interests unlike most others.
He cleans up and saves lost and stolen bikes, electric wheels, and weavers.
As a result, Bjartmar has earned the name “the wheeler. ”
Yesterday, when you published a report on your dealings with Bjartmar, there was a huge feathering trap.
In a discussion of the Facebook group of Western towns, DV pointed out that Bjartmar took the man to East Sweden and said that the vamp might be stolen.
It was only possible to read from the original writings of the electric calendar that Bjartmar taught it.
Those texts have now been changed to Facebook and the headline of original news of DV updated accordingly.
Bjartmar does not describe what really happened yesterday in Eastern Sweden.
Bjartmar said that he had been informed by the victims of electronic devices that they really were their electronics.
The information had an alleged owner, but it proved incorrect to Bjartmar.
“ I saw the guy, and I knew the shuttle, and then I found out that there was an electric shirt that had been missing for a long time and was looking for it.
I certainly hesitated first, but when I saw him preparing to drive on the shuttle, I decided to call the man.
The owner was sure of his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I'm very fine in this kind of thing, but before I got to finish what I had to say, the man had taken off my word."
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric ball just asked him to show him the receipt for the wheel and to call the police himself.
“ Yeah, cool,” said Bjartmar, “let's just get this straight. ”
Then the owner of the electrical shuttle proved the ownership of his electrical shuttle and took off.
Later, as recorded in the previous report, the owner of the electronic calendar’s history was told on Facebook.
During this more than a year Bjartmar has pursued this industry, he claims to be able to count the times he came up with people on the fingers of another hand.
“ I’ve had peaceful relations with the most difficult people in Reykjavik, ” said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are mostly the smallest brothers and sisters in the community, addicts, mentally handicapped people, and other people, some of whom are on the street.
“ The bitch is a tough master, and someone needs to finance the next dose, ” says Bjartmar, “unfortunately, stealing on such a loose end is an easy way to achieve that goal. ”
“ My dealings with these people are really so good that I have brought many of the good people with me.
There are examples of people going to treatment and getting involved and then looking to me and helping me with what I'm doing," he says.
In general, Bjartmar’s dealings with bikers are polite.
Some know of him and what he is doing, and they offer peacefully to show him receipts, wheel size numbers, and so on.
Wheeling is a major problem that has not been discussed.
In addition, Bjartmar says that the police have even begun to tell people to talk to him about stolen bikes.
Bjartmar is displeased with the previous report of the DV and claims to be not some self - organized police in a personal search for justice.
Asking if he is now not yet on the hill of ice by his action, and whether this is not primarily the role of the police, says Bjartmar.
“ Of course the police are doing this, but the fact is that the police are just not doing this.
I've been watching police driving away from a large pile of stolen wheels.
She's like, she's like, totally powerless in these matters."
“ When the police are not doing anything about this, and this is just in front of your nose, and the experience has shown that I can succeed in this class, why not?" Bjartmar asks.
He says that he has achieved so much success in finding stolen wheels that sometimes he rushes on his “girls ” on the street that they only right the Bjartmari wheels they had previously reached.
The times that Bjartmar has called for police assistance have resulted in her simply not being there.
“It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault, and it’s not the owners of the bikers ’ fault,” said Bjartmar, and I’m sorry that the victims of riding thieves have to suffer from the emptiness of the police in this case.
The outcome of Bjartmar is not shared.
In many parts of the world, you can find stories of people who thank Bjartmari for having obtained their possessions back to them.
In fact, Bjartmar himself says that he has long lost the number of rides that he has delivered, but the amount will probably run in millions if not millions.
The road there is a heavy power supply, an electric bicycle, and a heavy electric shovel, but an electric bicycle can cost less than half a million.
By day, Bjartmar works in a nursery school, and every other weekend he works in a community.
So his ride search is an unpaid job that he does in his spare time.
Pensions and Long Shadows
In 2019, there was a big birthday in the history of a pension fund in Iceland.
True, officials had received a retirement from the King of Dana all the streets since the 19th century, but in 1919 a pension fund was established for officials who eventually became the pension fund of all public employees.
The current pension funds for general wage earners were then laid down in a full range of labour market agreements in 1969, which included employment-related pension funds with a duty and a valid fund from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974 laws were established on the basis of these agreements, and the pension system continued to strengthen thereafter.
The wage - earner’s pension system was not the only radical change that the 20th - century labor movement pushed forward by its struggle for stability.
Unemployment insurance had similarly been obtained in historic strikes in 1955, and the organization gradually passed its health and medical fund requirements, a major holiday rights, shorter working hours, improvements in housing, and more of that as a matter of great importance.
All these rights cost a great deal of struggle, but it proved, after thinking, that much greater and more lasting compensation than the increase of the aurics in the wage package, which disappeared just as hard in the face of inflation, which characterized the postwar period and until 1990, as many remember.
In 1969, the adviser to the establishment of a public pension fund was both long and complex.
Although humans eventually came to the conclusion that the funds would be, in effect, property of the union, the labor movement had to agree that their governments were to appoint representatives of the workers and the social partners to the same extent.
In the following years after the fund was set up, the demand for the majority of the workers in the fund’s management often came to debate in the union of wage earners, but it never came true, and so we are still living up to the abnormal arrangement that the representatives of the fund’s associations are not in the majority of the fund’s governments.
Article 36 of Law No 129/1997 on the obligation to guarantee pension rights and the functioning of pension funds considers the investment policy of the funds.
It says in the 1st century that “a pension fund should be guided by the welfare of a union. ”
The fifth century also states: “A pension fund should set itself a moral standard for investments. ”
The share policy of the Trade Insurance Fund includes, inter alia, the following provisions, in the context of the aforementioned legal provisions:
The Pensions Fund is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) rules on responsible investments, along with many of the largest pension funds and industrialised Western and in Europe.
The rules discuss how emphasis on environmental and societal issues, as well as on good governance, can contribute to improved investment performance for stock exchanges.
In this way, the interests of investment and the aims of society are shared in a broader context.
LV considers it important that societies, especially those registered in the stock market, take a public approach to: maintaining good governance for social and environmental responsibilities.
The Pensions Fund, with the largest seaports, has set itself “a responsible investment policy, ” with similar provisions.
This is all recalled here as the introduction to the most recent fashion word in Icelandic, “Shadow Management. ”
Since the word for it is new, it is not the hope that it has been fully defined, but it seems to me that the following definition is now “most taken”: Shadow control is when a trade union leader says in the media that he intends to send the Society’s representatives in the management of pension funds or instructions on how to take a stand on a particular case.
If they fail to heed these instructions, they will be replaced by the government at first convenient times.
However, if the leader does not take this matter into the media and does not speak of resignation, it is not “shadow control, ” as, of course, human relations in the financial world are always the same as elsewhere.
I let the reader think about which way he feels “more shaky. ”
There are in particular two men who have tried to shape this definition when it is written, on Saturday, July 25, 2020.
There's a tough Egisson journalist on the Newssheet and Ásgeir Jonsson Bank Manager.
Both of the reasons were given after Boki Nils Bogason, director of Icelandair, had reported on his intention to break the social agreements with flight attendants and flight attendants (sell them up), and Ragnar Thor Ingofsson, director of the Trade Union Reykjavík, sent them out to the community representative of the Pensions Fund, not to support the potential purchase of the fund of shares in the partner, or they might be replaced.
Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, and as a result, Ragnar Thor went the same way with his recommendations, which of course were based on Boga’s decision.
Nevertheless, they saw hard, and Ásgeur’s reason for proselytizing the issue in the Friday newspaper News, with a big word about shadow control, breach of law, and a strong need for legal changes.
There would certainly be a small dove, though the blessed dove had been connected and was soon wiped out.
Since the matter is important, consider the subject itself at the end.
I explained above the elements of the pension law that are subject to this case.
This means that the fund governments must protect the interests of mutual societies and have moral criteria for investment, and these points are further developed in the agreed values and the Pensions Fund of merchants, as I have mentioned.
However, pension funds should NOT look only at short - term profit - making initiatives in their investments.
Such a policy would be a very dangerous one, and it does not have to be long looked at for examples of such things in the past, since banks and seamen have run into immoral adventurers and environmental events, with tragic consequences.
The director of Icelandair was evidently on the high ice when he thought of drying out a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the favors that the association has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakens its position with regard to investors.
Fortunately, he saw and pulled it back.
Time will reveal whether it will make it possible for an investment in pension funds in the partner to be considered accountable to the funders at the end of his career.

One of the infected didn't come home with a hit-and-run
One of the three diagnosed with Covid-19 on the land yesterday came to the country from the Baltic States on the last July 15, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelander who, though, is not permanently resident here, did not receive clear instructions to perform a so - called return misconception after arriving to the country and taking another sample several days after arriving.
He got negative from the border.
“ But he’s in an Icelandic community, and he’s actually going to get into it,” says Kamilla Josepsdóttir, a health care specialist at the County Doctor and a local pathologist during his summer vacation, in conversation with the News today.
“He used the English registration form, and there is no obligation to record the social security number, and if the social security number is not registered, you are not automatically announced in the second vision.”
It says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually resident in a foreign country, but because of his connection with the land he should have used it in Iceland.
But he didn't realize it.
“ When the number of teachers isn’t registered, you need to reach out for yourself to come to the second sample.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that it was the right way," Kamilla says.
“ It is clear, then, that while we find some way to perform an automatic preaching system, our information needs to be further developed.
Or, somehow, to make it more obvious who are participants in Icelandic society in the registration system," she explains.
Happily, though, few people were associated with the country, although it is defined as a participant in Icelandic society, a foreigner.
Only six were sent in sickness after he was diagnosed yesterday, and these six were all in contact with him.
They will still be on a sample, but two of them are showing the symptoms of Covid-19.
On July 15, the man received a negative demonstration at the border.
Kamilla is likely to have been infected recently with the virus that it could not yet be identified when the vision was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out the contamination of man here in Iceland but does not carry the virus with her to that country.
“ It’s not completely possible to claim that this is definitely an imported infection because it is a long time since he came to the country that he could have been exposed here like those two who have caused a little bit of control in connection with the sports conventions. ”
She says, though, that it is very unlikely because of the small number of humans around here.
“It’s really very unlikely,” says Kamilla, but it says that it can’t be ruled out until Icelandic genetic analysis has arranged the human virus.
“ If we get a virus that hasn’t been seen here before, it’s almost certain that he carried it to the country.”
Pitar sprays and bombs against Protestants
There was a conflict between the Seattle police and Protestants last night.
The police used peppersprey protestors and impertinent hand grenades, but Protestants broke windows and lit.
45 Protestants were arrested, and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racial prejudice were protested in many parts of the United States last night, while protest in Seattle was in support of Protestants in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one Protestant was shot to death.
As the BBC says, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered in peaceful protests.
Then a group of people set fire to construction sites and broke windows in the city’s courthouse.
As a result, the protests were undisturbed, and there was a conflict between protesters and the police.
In Aurora, Colorado, in 23 - year - old Elijah McClain, a black man murdered by a police officer last August, was the least of Protestants.
A car ran through a group of Protestants in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of National Guard officers came together and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26 - year - old black woman murdered by a police officer in his home last March.
The group carried firearms and marched into the state after closed street blocks, where the police charged the group from protesters ’ groups and also carried firearms.
At that time 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where Protestants remembered James Scurlock, a 22 - year - old black man murdered by a white bar owner in May.
Sunshine: Not the game that defines our period
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, soccer director of Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of the game at Leicester today on the final tour of the English Selection Department.
If the United loses the game, and Chelsea does not lose against Wolves, the end of Solskjær and his 5th-seat men and thereby misses the Master's seat.
However, they should still hope to join the Masters' Department by winning the European Division next month.
“ We have not come to an end.
If we reach a stage against Leicester, I think people will say that we haven't had a bad season now," said Solskjær.
“ But no matter what happens, this is not the end of our journey, because we still have considerable land to catch the two teams above us,” said Solskjær.
Clearly, at 15 a.m. today, there are nerves in humans, but Solskjær tried to pretend that each other was playing.
“ If you want to be part of Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure at the last stage of the season.
It's nothing new, and this is where the partner builds.
We've created a great opportunity to end the period well and now it's ours to use it," said Solskjær.
“ This isn’t the most important game of the season, it’s just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important one.
The result does not define our period, we have already had many moments to define this period."
“ Bruno Fernandes’ appearance changed a lot for us, and I think we are in a better shape and more spiritually than in the last period,” said Solskjær.
65,000 infections at 24 hours
According to John Hopkins University, 65,490 new infections of the crown virus were detected in the United States yesterday.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed from the beginning of the pandemic.
In the last four days, 900 deaths from the virus occurred yesterday, leading to deaths due to the virus being more than 1,000 per day.
A total of 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
The CNN reports that according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the number of virus deaths will be 175,000 on August 15, next.
Fear the Second Wave of the Epidemic
Spain’s governments are now ill - tried to restrain the expansion of COVID — 19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported more than 920 new cases of COMID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
No more reports have been reported in one day since early May, and reports are coming at the same time as Spanish begin to phase out one of the most stringent exits in Europe.
As a result, British authorities are now obliged by passengers from Spain to leave the country to suffer sickness when they return home.
A week earlier, Spain was on the British list of safe states.
What is worse is the situation in Catalonia, northeastern Spain, where governments have resorted to more extensive restrictions to try to curb growth.
In the capital city of Barselona, entertainment stations will be closed for the next two weeks and centuries to close at midnight.
At that time, a ban is now in force for 200,000 people in Segria County in western Catalonia.
It is estimated that British decision will have a negative effect on a Spanish economy that is very angry with the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly affected after the journey.
Tui, Britain’s largest travel agency, canceled all the scheduled flights to Spain and the Canary Islands today.
Governments around the world are said to prepare themselves for the second wave of the epidemic, but there seems to be little interest in resuming the extensive exit ban, which has in many places destroyed the economy.
To form, Mr. Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has taken such a bad deal and compared it to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Then Jean Castex, the prime minister of France, said that if the nation were again arrested on a national basis, “it would not survive. ”
Many counselors hope that local resources that will reach the inhabitants of individual towns, cities, or areas will be enough to keep the virus back on the next round if it arrives.
Five New Infections in Iceland - Three Inland
Three internal infections were identified yesterday as well as two additional border controls.
Thus, five people with positive Covid-19 infection were identified yesterday in Iceland.
According to a report by the public protection team, one infection is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
It has been sent to isolation and sixteen people who were in close association with him in sickness.
The victim was a social worker in Reykjavik, and according to the announcement, “only part of the sports team ” is sick.
Others who were sent into sickness are otherwise connected with man.
The origin of this infection is unidentified and full-blown in a U.S. Marshal's infectious team.
The ReyCUP convention’s opponents have followed the current guidelines and regulations of the preventive and public health care professionals and have taken appropriate measures.
Yet, pictures of the convention were received, where very close association could be seen to celebrate a good walk of their team on the field.
Just before 11 a.m. today, opponents published the following announcement on their Facebook page.
It says: “ACH: Parents kindly respect the rules that racers themselves apply for their own stuff at school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do so.
Thank you for your insight."
Other infections were diagnosed yesterday but related to the disease reported last day.
Says the announcement: “Icelandic genetic analysis has identified the infection and has revealed a new type of virus that has not been detected here before."
In this case, it is also infected and infected with isolation and 12 with infectious agents.
A third infection is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
He was diagnosed at the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in isolation, and six were in close association with him in sickness.
Two of them are already showing signs of viral infection.
In addition, two were identified at the border and are waiting for the conclusion of further studies, such as a cross - border worker’s accident.
Finally, the announcement states: The National Police Commissioner’s Civil Protection Department and the surgeon’s office require that people exercise caution and take careful care of individual protective measures.
If there is any doubt as to whether the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the same person is asked to perform a demonstration at the next clinic.
Patriarchs tell the tent area about commercial weekends - Live guests another
The Patreksfide tent area is fully booked this weekend, according to the announcement of the West.
Visitors should be advised to check out other accommodation options.
Mentioned by the western settlement of the Valley of Bildad, the Mountain of Throat, Melanes of the Red Sea, Hotel Flócalund, and Hotel Bídvik as a second option.
It is enough to be on the Patrol Office this weekend, for as in previous years, Skaldborg, a festival of Icelandic documentary works will be held in town.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a stronger tradition in town.
In the tent area, it is expected that this year, if weather does not count, a good attendance can be expected, while DV earlier said earlier today about a dazzling prediction.
However, the worst of the southern weather and the hope for the Patrexs can be expected.
The web bb.is first reported, saying that all other accommodations in town were already fully booked.
A whole apartment house is being burned down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live at Dunhaga for free 18-20.
Meanwhile, owners are applying for building permits, but their business has been in operation for the third year.
In one of the oldest, growing and most expensive neighbourhoods of Reykjaviki, there is a beautiful three - floor apartment building.
On the floor of the house is some 600 square feet [600 square km] of shopping space.
There are two stairways at the back of the house, each containing four rather beautiful deposits.
They range from 93 to 130 square metres, although most are over 100.
The house has quite a history.
It was built in 1959 and has even hosted video rentals, the Forest Office, the milk store of the Milk Trader, Joa gunsmith, fish sales, and now, last, University printers.
The house, that is to be spoken, hath made its fig fairer.
The house is now severely damaged, as can be seen in the pictures provided.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf are, according to a company program, among others, Magnús Magnús son and Guðrun Helga Lárusdótti.
Magnús served as a defender of the Borg estate.
Among the owners of the Borg Society’s property company is the Steel Ship, U.S.A.
A steel ship, e. g., is the investment company of Guðrúnar Holy Lady of Lárusdót and her children.
Guðrún also owns the third part of D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband Augustus Gudmundur Sigurðsson once ran a steelship.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009, so little has been kept since then.
Neighbors say that the condition of the house has worsened steadily since then, though most recently.
One local Facebook page says that the house “was not very lively in the last few years. ”
There, it may be that owners have spent a few years trying to change the house and the property.
Other neighbors say the house hasn’t been right for long.
“ It’s a long time to do something nice with this spot and it’s boring that it’s so pulled out. ”
If he also says he's pissed off into the owners of the house for not having made it through, finding some common surface with the neighbors of the house, and stopping this "legal" pole.
“Just do this in consultation with the community around you so you can get on with it and finish it.”
The “Legisty Step” to which reference is made is the field’s planning process that has been under way since 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga, 18 and 20, were reached by permission to build the height of the present apartment building and behind the house, a new elevator house, and a building of one floor, as well as a basement.
The building permit granted for this operation was addressed to the Committee on Environment and Resources and did not disqualify the Committee because it was not supported by a sharing structure and branching.
The city of Reykjavik then started a dispute - organization campaign and ended it with an advertisement in the State Times in July of last year.
It was also a matter of urgency and rejected by the Committee by March 2020.
At this point, therefore, nearly three years had passed since the original application for a building permit and owner of the house was established.
At that time, the house had suffered considerably, and neighbors began to tire out.
When DV asked neighbors about the situation and the reaction of neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some understood the intentions of the owners of the house, others did not.
Others turned their anger toward the city, others did not.
Others were just angry, but nothing necessarily in anyone.
Still others said the parking lot was a fight, but neighbors have used unused Dunhaga’s car shop for their vehicles for 18-20.
One person in charge of the case said that he was tired of the government:
“ That we have to go through the three - hour process is amazing.
It's like Reykjavik City doesn't know how to read."
Today the house is empty, abandoned, and neglected.
Remember the squabble of the city’s administration and the noble claims of the owner and the many years of work of their present - day employees.
When a journalist arrived at Dunhaga 18, he blew open doors and garbage piles.
Playstation computers and recent TVs were surrounded by other garbage on the planet — victims of an Icelandic summer party.
A great deal of cats from the smell of gnawing were opened into the old University Press office.
Clearly, there is someone who has been riding in one corner, but no one is visible.
Boards of couches and beds and several blocks of geology pages, which would no doubt become a book, broke.
The building’s ladders were also open and alive in both.
A journalist was so lucky to stumble on the inhabitants of one of them.
It was there that the Romanians made themselves a potato dish for dinner and invited a journalist in.
The Romanians work for Ztrongforce ehf.
They've been there for some time, embodying the authority of the D.V. that the company has paid nothing for the house except heat and electricity.
Because of the condition of the house, rent is not a defenceable thing to do.
From mail in the lobby, it is clear that some foreign workers have lived there during the last misses.
Staff remuneration has not been a part of the Covid-19 state of affairs, as a contraction in tourism has led to a contraction in construction activities, and these two industries have been the most able to make use of staff services.
Nevertheless, in Dunhaga 18, the household members seemed to have enough to do and the labor gap and winters in the community to dry after a long working day in the rain.
Take note that despite the terrible condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist told the boys Romanian, the sarcasm suddenly became clear: In the best place in Reykjavik, 1,500 square feet [500 sq m] of real estate stands down.
Owners want to change the house to improve, and neighbors want to improve the situation, but share the definition of “profit”.
Between them are the initial planning areas of the city, the victims of endless appeal routes and the legal possibilities of the planning process, and the release of the Committee on Environment and Resources by the decision-making committee.
In the house there are so Romanian workers, perhaps just those who are going to improve the situation, when the Icelandic cease to argue.
The article was originally published in July 17, DV.
In an overweight campaign following a Coronosis
Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, will provide 10 million pounds in a campaign against overweight, which will, among other things, be prohibited from urgent complaints, following his severe illness, partly because of his weight.
Johnson may present the campaign called Better Health tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe bike rides for their clients overweight and will also be faced with an increase in bike rides.
Then, according to British press reports, advertising on television will be banned before 21:00 a.m.
“CAVID—19 has raised our short and long-term risks of being overweight, and the prime minister is determined that we must use the time to become more healthy, more active, and eating a healthy diet,” said a government spokesman.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was admitted to intensive care when he was infected with the crown virus in the spring, and is partly due to his weight because he is believed to have become so seriously ill.
Women Better to Lead the Change
She said that the new constitution was the greatest step that the nation can take toward greater distribution of power, transparency, and working against corruption and the interests of the whole.
“ We have to change gear a bit now, and who better to bring such changes than the group of society that is more likely to be in these values.
There are women," said Helga.
“ Women in Iceland are famous for their women’s unity.
To stand together and be together to lead change.
So now it's just time for us to bring these changes."
She said that she was somewhat alarmed at the emphasis on Iceland as “the best in the world ” in both gender equality and human rights.
“ Then we are not as ready to examine what needs to be done.
Like the Germans, they are very conscious of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
There's a lot of stuff.
We need to know where we're coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of the bordered groups.
We don't have the same rules here," said Helga.
While she said that she was in many good things in Iceland, she added that, like many other places, Iceland was living at an enormous male value.
She said that politics was about making up personal interests, authority, and authority that were the forces that were held wrong in all communities.
“ Women are now starting this group and coming together and are just a little frustrated that the people will be reluctant to overlook this 2012 national resolution,” she said.
“ It’s these feminine values that we’re thinking about.
Based on human rights and nature protection, cooperation and that we all really sit at the same level," she said and added that the aforementioned value was the baseline in the new constitution.
“ We are a very rich country of natural poverty, and it is ridiculous that there are people living in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can change different," said Helga.
“ It’s ridiculous that there’s some natural law that women’s jobs are always less paid.
It's ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses need to be in an endless battle just to obtain a man-made reward."

Trying to rob a walker in downtown
A man was arrested in the middle of the night after he threatened to walk and tried to recover money from him.
The police also stopped the production of narcotics in a city where two were arrested for the cause.
Then the police stopped a motorcycle driver in the Hhlins where his driver was at 146 kmph, where the maximum speed is 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of driving rights.
The police in the capital area had enough to turn tonight and more than 80 cases were recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
There was a great deal of noise reports because of a conversation.
Saturday night, news reports of eleven noisy meetings were widely recorded in the police journal.
Last night, however, 22 noises struck the police.
Six were saved in a prison cell last night.
During the year, the police were called tonight when others shot fireworks in the air.
However, they had escaped when policemen came in.
At that time nine drivers were stopped for drunkenness and drug abuse.
Four were arrested for fighting in the middle of the night, one of which was saved in a prison cell.
Then two were taken to an emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in the middle of the town, and the other in the west of the town.
One was transferred to an accident ward after he was injured in jumping on a trampoline in Kopavogi.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver who pulled a trailer on Kjalarnesi yesterday.
According to the police diary, the trailer’s dress equipment was in “a very bad condition ” and was stopped.
You can stay at Monet's house about the commercial weekend
The house in which the Impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his sleep is now for rent on the Airbnb page.
The next free night in the house is about the commercial weekend.
The house is small and curly, located in the town of Geenery, Normandie, France.
The painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two living rooms, and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his gardens famous in this house.
If someone wants to rent the house, he must rent at least two nights.
Based on Airbnb’s page, it is next available after a week, on Sunday’s shopping weekend, and so it might be perfect for some merchants on vacation to go to book the painter’s house.
The two nights over a commercial weekend will cost only $964 or just $30,000 as the next issue will be.
Deficiency of the disease and some of them have begun to show the signs and symptoms of the disease caused by the crown virus
Five of them have been diagnosed with the crown virus in their own country within the last three days, and most of the infected are unrelated.
There are a number of people who are sick because of this, and some of them have begun to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three of them were diagnosed with the inland crown virus yesterday and two at the border inspection.
According to a surgeon’s official expert, a growing number of domestic infections do not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading widely into society.
“ It’s a virus that hasn’t been seen here before, so we have no special reason to think that it’s been hidden in society for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very careful now," said Kamilla Sigríður Josephsdóttir, an expert in the field of soil protection.
Most of the infected individuals have been associated with individuals from abroad.
Further demonstrations are being carried out in the near future, but some who were associated with the infected are starting to show the signs and symptoms of the crown virus.
“Now is not an influenza and less about other respiratory infections, so we can be quite liberal by doing these tests on individuals who, at the time of influenza, would have found a reason to do something else first,” said Kamilla.
Smuggling is mostly complete, but there is no possibility that more people will have to get sick.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending sports events.
Has it raised questions as to whether such events can be defended?
As long as people adhere to standards and regulations, the public - minded liaison manager says it well.
Kamilla says that it is virtually impossible for the infected to be infected at sports conventions.
“ If, after associating with them at these sports events, there is no isolation from these individuals, we can claim that our conventions have worked.
But it hasn't come to light," said Kamilla.
We have a continuous review of the UN Security Department's operations.
“We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or limitations if that seems to be the case,” said Kamilla.
After more than a week, there will be mass limitations that will be reduced to a thousand people.
This new location may affect relaxation.
"A certain meditation on cooking" - View Elisa Vidar's menu
Elisha the daughter of Vidar is a professional soccer player and plays with Val.
She also serves as a nutritionist, mother.
It needs a lot of energy for day’s interests and usually takes time to eat good and nutritious food.
My usual day starts by coming up to work from eight," says Elisha.
“ After work, I go to the store to prepare my dinner before I pick up my girl at the kindergarten about 3:00 p.m. ”
Elisha is very nourishing to get her daughter to school early.
“ It’s good to have time with her before I go to practice the second party.
After rehearsal, it's good to come home and just warm up the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one thing to empty our mind."
Elisha does not follow any particular diet.
She is putting her final hands on master literature in nutrition, and she knows well what is right for her to eat to have enough energy to do work, school, family, and exercise.
“ What I like is to eat a variety of foods that are well made from proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.
However, I feel that it is most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not to classify food in bad or good, rather nutritious or nutritious.
It's all right to eat everything, just not suddenly and not always."
Elisha is very interested in cooking.
“ I think there’s a certain thought in standing in the kitchen cooking and picking it up very much.
I must say that my confidence is in the kitchen with me, and I sincerely believe that I am a good cook."
Breakfast: Hake, chia-seed, hemp seed, salt, little lemon juice, leave in almond milk overnight.
Make this meal as high as possible.
Most often it's a banana and a musli & a KAFFI jumper.
I'm a big coffee lady.
Media: Unbelievably different, but fruit or vegetables, flat cookies, clean shirts with bananas and muslims, bread with butter, and then I could eat hummus with a spoon out of a box if that is the case.
Noon meal: I often make all kinds of foody salads from what is in the fridge, quina, or buildings, falafelsballs, rock salads, baked vegetables with good dressing is a bit of what I am working with.
If the organization gets completely out of hand (which often happens), the egg engine at work has got me pretty many times to save, and then there are two pieces of bread with butter, cheese, and boiled eggs, no more.
Media: Get me some carbohydrates for practice, bread with butter, cereal, or fruit.
Dinner: Fish are very often chosen in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Police - Protestant conflict in Seattle
The Seattle City Council, in Washington, has declared a state of rebellion following massive protests in the city.
The police yesterday seized a fire bomb and a pepper spray to try and rust a large area that the Protestants conquered and stretched over many blocks in the vicinity of the council building in the city.
The police reported to Twitter that at least eleven Protestants had been arrested and that there was a investigation into a damage at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
Civil and police authorities say that the Protestants stoned the police with stones, bottles, explosives, and other illegal acts and were transferred to a hospital where his injuries were done.
But Seattle’s protests were peaceful for a long time.
They were used to show resistance to Protestants in Portland, Oregon, where there has been a repeated conflict between Protestants and the heavily armed forces of the FBI.
There, like in other U.S. cities, people gather under Black Lives Matter’s signs, recall George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, protests systematic racism in an American community and demands an improvement.
Not revoked until after voting
It is not yet clear whether the resignations of Miss Icelandair, who will take effect about the next month, will be revoked.
An electronic vote on Iceland's airline airline to Icelandair will end tomorrow at noon.
Gudlaug Liney Johannnsdóttir, president of the Society, claims that Icelandair will not decide on the resignation until the result of the vote is reached.
“ It’s really hanging together, ” says Godlaug Liney.
“ There have been no resignations, this must begin to lie so that the machines can be installed.
Of course, people are anxious to know if they will be working after the months."
A contract signed a week ago, close to July 19th.
It is expected to be due until the end of September 2025 and is based on a contract previously signed by flight attendants.
On July 17th, Iceland’s airline’s government and confidence council agreed to announce an all - military job stop at Icelandair, which was approved by the social partners in a vote.
It never came to her, but this was decided upon following Icelandair's decision to cancel interviews with the Flyfranchet Company, terminate all her flyers, and search for contracts with another union.
Then the Society’s pilots were to take on the activities of microbes on board temporarily.
Ask her how she feels the vote will go, Godlaug Liney says it is hard to say.
“ People are in pain after this event of Icelandair, when all of the community’s flight crews were dismissed and announced that an agreement would be made with another trade union.
Now it's clear if it's going to affect," she says.
At the end of April, 940 flight attendants were working with Icelandair, at which 900 of them, about 95%, were dismissed.
Their reputation is different, for those who have their shortest working life, as it is three months, and so ends at the end of the month of July-August.
This group contains about 90% of Icelandair aircraft.
What will happen if the agreement is not approved?
“ Then we would like to continue our discussions with our associates.
With this deal, we're meeting Icelandair's demands.
If he is rejected, it is clear that flightists seem to have gone too far."
The vote on the collective agreement ends and Icelandair presents the settlement of the second quarter of the year tomorrow
The vote will be taken by the flight attendants on a new competition agreement at 12 noon tomorrow.
Icelandair's accounts for the second quarter of the year will also be published tomorrow, but interim results indicate that the social income has decreased by 85 percent from the same period last year.
The electronic vote on Iceland's Flying Party and the Federation of Professionals for Icelandair began on Wednesday, July 22nd, and ends tomorrow, July 27th, at noon.
Those who have the right to opt for the contract are Icelandair employees who pay social contributions to the Air France Association.
Icelandair and the FFI signed a new agreement on Sunday, July 19th, but on Friday, Icelandair had cut off interviews with the partner after flight attendants had collated their previous vote on a previous agreement at the beginning of July.
At that time, Icelandair had told all the flight crews and shipmates up on Friday, but they were withdrawn after the signing of a new nuclear agreement.
According to a new collective agreement, flyers need to fly five hours more per month for the same basic salary.
The nuclear agreement runs until 2025, where pilots and flight attendants have been integrated into the rules for how long they can fly on one shift.
The contract was presented to the FFI social partners at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday and described many flight attendants who spoke to them about the inconvenience caused by the agreement.
Most, however, seemed to agree that the agreement had to be approved to keep the IFI alive.
The bill for the second quarter of the year will be announced, whereas the EBIT, its operating product for finance and taxes, is negative, according to preliminary development, about USD 100 million to USD 110 million, or about USD 15 billion.
Icelandair sent an interim calculation to the Copenhagen Council last Wednesday, which said that the Society’s income was about $60 million in the quarter or about $8.3 billion.
At the end of the quarter, about $154 million in commercial money and its equivalent was worth about $154 million.
Icelandair also plans to offer the Society’s share money in August.
Icelandair's policy is to conclude contracts with fifteen borrowers, governments and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of a month before partial tender.
New variants rather than new types of virus
“New viruses just mean that it has been a person who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been templateting here in the country," says Má Kriståsson, head of the Land Hospital’s infectious disease department, who reports that “new type of virus” has been diagnosed here.
Three internal infections were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One who was diagnosed had participated in a sports club at the Rey Cup soccer club, but the origin of the infection is unknown and the duration of the infection.
An individual who arrived in the country on July 15, and who was in a relationship with him, was also diagnosed with infection, starting to show signs of COMID-19.
In this case, yesterday’s transmission related infections reported in the morning and after sequencing in Icelandic genetic analysis, “a new type of virus that has not been identified here before” was identified.
Convulsions have been completed in connection with this infection.
It may be said that there is no new virus but that this virus is the same and has spread around the world, i.e. the new SARS-CoV-2 crown virus.
It is better to talk about a new variant of the virus than about a new type of virus.
Asking what it means and whether it might say something about another outbreak of epidemics may begin, may say that at the moment it is a case of a single case and it may happen to be nothing more about it.
“ However, if there are cases of non-associated domestic origin with the same genotype as this particular variant, it would be possible to draw that conclusion [of the second wave], but it is premature that so supported,” explains Már.
Oh, my hot tub.
Is the secret to the happiness of Iceland’s hot pots?
The BBC’s schedulers lead to the likeness of a fun video that sheds light on the country’s swimming eyes and hotspot culture.
The Icelandic bath culture is unique on a global scale, and it is claimed that there are no such number of bathing places worldwide.
The natural heat of the earth is its foundation, but also the tradition of this divisive state.
Children’s health training was legal in 1940, but older citizens are no less able to use hot water to improve their health.
Health travel is described as part of the country’s general well - being.
The pot is all equal, regardless of the class and position.
The mobile phones talk about personal things at home and space, or they use the likeness of water: meditations and batteries of soul and body.
To pick up a hundred days on election
A hundred days will be until the Americans vote and elect presidents to four years.
Donald Trump is looking for a return, but he's got a catch.
Joe Biden, who is the prospective candidate of the Democratic Party, has a high priority on Trump on a national scale, is taken into account by polls.
According to a new AP Journal survey, the estimated American population is on the wrong track.
Trump’s response to the epidemic of the new crown virus is also very unpopular, and in addition, more Americans believe that the president was in a bad position to control the economy.
In particular, only two out of ten Americans say the United States is on its way.
32 percent claim to support Trump’s epidemic response, and 48 percent say he has kept the economy well.
In March it was 56 percent, and in January it was 67 percent.
Based on the average of FiveThirtyEight, Biden is 49.9 percent national but is 41.9 percent national.
Trump himself has tried to draw his attention to the epidemic’s performance, promote so - called cultural debate, and promote a policy that should turn to law and order.
However, Biden’s offer is very keen to keep your eye on Trump and count it very likely to win if the election is really about how Trump has been working in the last four years.
Invincible Trump also seems to be going to bring down the Republican Congressmen and fear the Future that the Democrats could even obtain a majority in the U.S. Senate, which has so far been very accomplished.
Policeco reported on the days of keeping up with groups and candidates, and that is now the Republican Party would gain its greatest power over decades.
Execution has proved particularly bad in the 2016 Congresses and is now looking forward to this trend.
In recent times, Trump has tried to scare the inhabitants of the suburbs to follow him, including saying that if President Biden is to be, he will destroy the suburbs of the United States and promote racial strife.
Among other things, Trump has closed down the rules from Barack Obama’s time in the White House, which was designed to increase the diversity of the countryside.
Then he urged “mothers ” of the U.S. districts to read an article by former assistant director of New York City, claiming that Biden would destroy the U.S. suburbs and accept Trump.
“ Biden will ruin your neighborhoods and the American dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it better!" said the President.
In the United States, there is an ever - growing group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become president.
Except in 2012 when My Romney received the majority of votes from this group but lost for Barack Obama.
The polls have shown that despite the fact that Trump secured a small majority in the 2016 suburbs, there was a significant contraction.
Although there are differences between the rabbits, Biden has reported about 15 percent advance on Trump in the rest of the world.

Will the Olympic Fire be the light at the end of the tunnel?
After the final decision had been taken to postpone the Olympic Games, events that only world wars have advanced to that point, the president of the Olympic Commission said that the famous Olympic Fire would be “the light at the end of the corridors, ” pointing forward to a future world epidemic of crown viruses that the inhabited world is now passing through in unity.
In Japan, Africans have an additional year to prepare themselves, and Japanese authorities have an added cost of delay.
Everyone keeps a head at stake, though.
When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan, would be the scene of the Olympic Games this year, the gladness of the Japanese representatives was real.
They cried and laughed over time, as Tokyo had applied for the 2016 games, but they snuck down the turn for Rio in Brazil.
This time Tokyo and Japan had to bathe in the attention of the world.
The games were scheduled to take place on July 24 to August 9, but they have been postponed for a year, instead starting on July 23, 2021, ending on August 8.
If they are not able to keep, if the crown virus is still too threatened, the games will be stopped.
Yet, no one completely wants to think that way.
Olympics aren't a regular sports competition.
Nothing is saved, the show should always be wonderful, and strive to top the last game.
The choice of a city for Olympicism is based on the assessment of the constituents of the cities' presentations.
The grander the presentation is — the more likely it will be.
Tokyo spent 150 million dollars trying to maintain the 2016 Olympic Games, or worth over $20 billion.
The second time, when applying for the 2020 games, 75 million dollars, about 10 billion dollars, were put in the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo had been given the games this year, the Japanese authorities had a total amount of DKK 30 billion for the project.
But the amount is just a drop in the sea compared to what it takes to build the Olympic village, stadiums, and generally to strengthen the interior to cope with such conventions, prepare them, and keep the games themselves.
Japan’s organisers have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been going on these days but which have been postponed for about one year for the crown virus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report by a government accountant in Japan, published at the end of last year, found that the cost was almost twice that figure.
The cost of delaying the game may not be fully estimated, but it has been estimated that it may cost between $2 and $600 billion in addition to the initial cost.
Thus, the total cost to the Japanese Olympics and Japanese taxpayers could run from 15 to 30 billion dollars.
There are so large figures that all taxes levied by the Icelandic State only for nearly half the Olympic Games, based on the lowest possible cost.
Opportunity is an event of the magnitude of their discussion with economists who try to look at the benefits and benefits of the games.
In the main, it seems that quite a few have come to the conclusion that the impact of the Olympic Games is less than so positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.
The short - term effect is some one, for example, a very large number of jobs for a short time, but in the longer run cities tend to spend a lot of time on debt and the high operating costs of small used human beings.
Rio in Brazil has a strong debt for the 2016 games and has been struggling to sustain all the big sports facilities built for the games.
There have been figures after the games in London in 2012, but it has been found that only 10 percent of those who received a job related to the Olympic Games in the city were unemployed before.
This means that only a small part of the job was new.
In general, cities have not been particularly successful in maintaining Olympicism financially because of the striking cost of the human labors that are built for the games.
However, profit is often considered to be an increase in the traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities following the games, which, however, are very uncertain about the games in 2021.
It is also uncertain whether all the audiences usually attend the games can be accepted.
The main issue, though, is the honor the cities have had, but it is difficult to appreciate for money.
Despite the enormous cost, it may also be said that the joy the players bring is not the kind of price that can be priced.
Of course, while the show is often magnificent and there is no place for it to be saved, it is not just about money.
It's the sports heroes that's in the foreground.
For some Africans, delaying the game is surprising.
For example, the Australian fifth-rate woman and the Golden Award winner in his article on the Olympic Games page, Chloe Esposito, is a caso plain and would have been far from the fun of summer, but they hope to be in a competitive form for the games in 2021.
So it is among those athletes who are just more content with the delay, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to quit the games this year, if they had been held at the right time, in some cases the delay of the games means that they will quit the competition before the games take place.
Trust in his body simply not to go through years in addition to rigid exercises.
A small number of athletes came to the hearts of the audience at the Rio Olympic Games in 2016 and Simone Biles the superstar.
She came home with four golds around her neck and one bronze.
Some interviews in the United States have taken place recently to discuss the Olympic Games.
She intends to play in 2021, but she is not sure that she will still be at the top of the games next year, as she will be 24 years old.
While it is generally not considered to be high age, it is higher for a leading gymnasium.
“ This is a sensitive subject,” says Biles, “but it smiles at another interview on the Instagram site of the Olympics committee, asking if she is going to get as far in the 2021 games as she did in Rio 2016.
“ I just don’t know if I’ll still be on top after a year in addition to practice, ” says Biles.
She has previously mentioned that her body is unable to cope with the pressures of physical training for much longer.
Nevertheless, she exerts her zeal for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was an unpleasant feeling to suddenly stop practicing when the world’s epidemic was at its height and the gym was closed.
There were no exceptions for Biles rather than others while all sportsmen were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic gold could not buy any other access, she needed to find ways to stay in shape like others.
True, the basic form is slightly better than for most people.
“ We have a hard plan now.
It was hard to start training first after the gym opened.
We started slowly, but we are back on track, and I will continue to do so gradually according to the past of the year.
Of course, we do not know exactly how these games will be held, or whether they will be held, but we do practice as to whether they will be.
I've put too much effort on myself to leave the sport now," says Biles.
With it, like others, there is a doubt, or perhaps more awareness, that the situation may be that the games will not be held at all in 2021.
But to predict it is hopeless.
No one can know what the situation during the Crown Virus pandemic will be like in July 2021 and nothing else to do about preparing for the Olympic Games compared with their annual attendance.
Maybe the Olympic Fire will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnel.
Life - Freeness of Marriage
The modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding because of the crown virus.
She was to be married to the former Bachelorette Wells Adams this summer.
“I think it’s more important things to think about right now,” said the actress in a conversation with People.
“ We really want to get married sometime and then have our dream wedding and have all the people who care about us.
But we decided to delay and focus on what is important now, and it is helping to share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I look more into the world than the weddings of these days.
There are many things going on, and we should focus our attention on what is happening in the world."
