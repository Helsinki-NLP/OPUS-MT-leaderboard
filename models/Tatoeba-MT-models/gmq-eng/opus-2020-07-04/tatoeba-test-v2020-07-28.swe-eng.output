She's taken on too much work.
She's stubborn.
Give Tom a handle.

Does Tom know how you feel about him?
Tom wondered if what Mary said was true.
We'll never get along.
It is uncertain whether the letter ever emerged or not.
We haven't done anything.
You dropped your pen.
Are you gonna lie in bed all day?
Tom can't do that.
Tom crawled under the barbed wire.
I didn't even know her name.
Are you really gonna do that?

Have I forgotten anything?
You're longer than me.
Happy birthday.
I don't even want you here.
I like to go to new places and see new things.
I have to sit down.
Aren't we friends?
Her speech bore me.

You should have liked it.
I've got a few more.
I'm using the computer.
Six were invited, the boy included.
Kate's cold.
I know you miss your family.
What was your plan?
Tom seems bored.
He's not angry.
There is no doubt about who will be elected.
He got hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep myself motivated.
It's weird.
Have you read the fairy tale of the ring trilogy?
I'm a man now.
Greek is not an easy language.
Thanks for taking care of my dog.
She advocated equality.
What are you looking at?
They died young.
Stop talking to me.
Say hello, glasses brother.

I was just teasing.
Stay down.
You weren't here then.
Here comes Tom.

No one's too old to learn.
I'd do anything for love.
Two men with ski masks went into the bank.
This book belongs to the school library.
None of it was real.
There must be a pattern.
It hurts to have to say this, but it's the truth.
Tom tricked me.
Tom's helping.
One morning he saw a pretty girl.
This tree isn't even close to being the highest in the socks.
Let me take a look.
Tom wants our help.
Time's up.
My father is healthy.
We can save many lives.
If you don't have any money, you'll have to make it without it.
I'm afraid to go home.
Just say it.
Helen's words suddenly filled me with new power.
Put the cake on the table.
I know you're angry.
Do you need anything?
I want a pair of gloves.
That's exactly what I needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I'm already late.
Even Mom knows about it.
He should have done it already.
Room service, please.
Who were you talking to?
The boy grabbed the cat's tail.
How do you know that?
I got a lot of mosquito bites.
I'm unemployed.
This medicine will cure your cold.
This reminds you of someone?
I'd like to talk to Tom about a blow between four eyes.
He will fall for temptation.
The TV's not working.
I can explain.
She's acting like a child.
What does it look like?
Mary thinks she has superpowers.
I know all of this.
Everyone needs to know.
After stopping, the train accelerated rapidly.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to agree, but can you at least accept that there are people who have opinions other than you?
Tom dropped the book.
I'm the best.
English is hard, isn't it?
I can go to school in ten minutes.
Are you done now?
She wouldn't want to see him again.
Even during working hours, I pay for my online addiction.
I never thought it would be this hard to create an iPad app.
You weren't gone long.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I can't get in town.
At least it wasn't boring.
Can you freeze it down?
Tom blinked with the lights.
Are you threatening me?
Tom's worried.
I used to like coming here.
This isn't a fish.
Maybe Tom and Mary didn't do what everybody says they did.
There's no one here named like that.
It's time to go.
All three men smiled.
Come sit down.
That's got to do it.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.
My chainsaw is broken.
You think she's pretty, huh?
He lived a simple life.
This is going to take years.
I spelled the word wrong.
I don't like this book.
A octopus has ten arms.
She didn't show up before two.
I am.
That was very good.
Come and talk to me.
He took care of the baby.
Leave me alone!
I had never seen such a peaceful sight.
Tom's fast.
Of the Finns, approximately 4.9 per cent are Finnish Swedes, i.e. people with Swedish as their mother tongue.
Unfortunately, Tom delayed.
What is the difference between American and British English?
I'll read the book.
I made the wedding cake.
Use a scalpel, not an axe.
Could you write down the link to that site?
She attached a photo.
The walls of the old house were not straight.
Where is she?
It feels really good.
Why do you like it?
What would you say if you were in this situation?
Give me three weeks.
The driver turned the wheel to the right.
I'm in the wind.
Tom said he doesn't eat meat.

At home, I discovered the break-in.
The cat has two ears.
Not really.
You don't even like chocolate.

We have to find it.
What's missing?
I can do it myself!
Don't worry.
She paid seven percent interest on the loan.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to fire you.
Can I think about it?
When did you see Tom?
It's not important!
Strange things happened on her birthday.
Does anyone here speak Russian?
I drove the car.
I have great news.
Are we safe yet?
