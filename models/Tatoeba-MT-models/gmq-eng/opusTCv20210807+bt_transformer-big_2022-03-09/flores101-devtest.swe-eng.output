The U.S. Gymnastics Association supports the letter of the U.S. Olympic Committee and agrees that it is imperative that the Olympic family promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs can be served better if we move forward with a meaningful change to our organization, than if the certification is removed.
The U.S. Gymnastics Association supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how an abuse of such proportions as that so boldly described by survivor Larry Nassar may have gone on undetected for so long, and it welcomes necessary and expedient changes.
USA Gymnastics and USOC have the same goal - to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible, so that athletes can follow their dreams in a safe, positive and empowering environment.

It not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils often cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. The researchers say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown on the top, with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Since the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, so-called coil, but on the other hand have other characteristics of feathers – rays and bee rays – the researchers concluded that the coil was probably a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flying but instead for temperature regulation or for display. The researchers suggested that the specimen shows an adult plumage and not chicken down, even if the tail comes from a young dinosaur.
The researchers argued that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not young down.
A car bomb that detonated at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other people.

They found that the sun worked according to the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system was found to be driven by their brightness, their rotation, and nothing else.
With the help of brightness and rotation, the star's ross-by-number is determined, which has to do with plasma flows.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect that the team was looking for would be caused by forces similar to the tides of the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts attraction on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The researchers found that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a kind of halo, and is made of lots of tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
"In an interview, he said the new variant was ""very worrying and alarming because of the very high mortality rate."""
Some patients may have been infected by the bacterium in the hospital, Dr Moll believes, at least two of whom were hospital staff.
During the year, an infected person can transmit the infection to between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, it seems that the proportion of people with XDR-TB in the whole group of people with tuberculosis is still low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people infected at any given time in South Africa.

"They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night."
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth that often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with these being deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) team for astrogeology and at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put an oppressed sheet of paper with their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting document.
French electoral law codifies the approach fairly strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those duly counted from the eligible voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers who are under extensive supervision, and who follow specific procedures.

Four skiers in the women's seated group were unable to finish their runs and 45 of the total 117 participating skiers in the giant slalom failed to place themselves in the competition.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
"Vice Superintendent General D K Arya said, ""We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile and laptop."""
The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki announced that the accused appeared at the court with covered faces.
Although three people were in the house when the car collided with it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services cut off the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalised at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been accused in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court of murdering her son.
She is in detention pending prosecution and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may become worthless because her picture has been widely published.
This is common elsewhere in the UK but Scottish law works differently and courts have considered publishing photos as potentially harmful.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University notes that ""journalists choose a dangerous line if they publish photos etc. of suspects."""
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has stated to journalists that no further comments will be made prior to prosecution.
According to the leak, the document deals with the border dispute, where Palestinians want the borders to be based on them before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics reported on are the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel requests ten years of constant military presence in the valley after an agreement has been signed, while the PA only agrees to leave such a presence for five years.
Hunters in the supplemental pest control trial would be closely monitored by the park attendants, as the trial was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, volunteers were recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and culture at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting assignment received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former Provisional Electoral Council, as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that started in October.
The partly violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have lapsed since 2011.
There have been reports of about 60 cases of misdesigned iPods overheating, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had known of 27 accidents related to the units.
"METI announced last week that Apple had informed about 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company called ""mild."""
"The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "very regrettable.""
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The office of the Northern Mariana Islands emergency services announced that no injuries were reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also announced that there was no indication of tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the Philippines' capital.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have so far been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later switched places with an elderly lady because she was in need of toilet visits. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births during his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would speed up fetal lung maturation.
"Xinhua reported that government investigators salvaged two ""black boxes"" on Wednesday."
Colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said ""Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died during the night with two moons. Quite unique just like her. Strong woman.""
"Dustin ""Goldust""" Runnels said in a comment that ""Luna was as big a freak as I...maybe even bigger...love her and will miss her...hopefully she's better off where she is now."""
Out of 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic had grown by 8 percent since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the campaign at the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
Thirty-four percent of respondents said that Queen Elizabeth II would be Australia’s last monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist would have swum the 100 m and 200 freestyle as well as three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his inconvenience, there have been doubts about his fitness.
He has not been able to take the medications needed to overcome his pain as they are banned in the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number to date, on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery with various hardware and software at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water resources on Earth, along with organic matter, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Since comets collided with Earth long ago, scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
"He referred to the rumors as ""political nonsense and nonsense""."
It is speculated that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would mean the planes fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology unlike older ground radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport is put in, and trains over land will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride stations are not available at ground level.
The fear of lack of means of transport opened the possibility that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process is believed to have taken much longer due to breeding between the endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant Espa-oladarwin finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled into thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
"It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called ""enlightened manuscripts""."
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The juice from the cabbage changes shade depending on how acidic or alkaline (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH value is shown by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Stir together the two dry powders. Then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with flushing in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman society, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women stayed together.
When you call someone hundreds of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space with the help of rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts a little of our light and field of vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 30 meters to get a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing that the wheel has brought is to give us much easier and faster transport methods.
It has given us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including loose pet cats) that eat a much larger amount of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special job for every cat that keeps it from rivalling with others.
Lions are the most social felines, and live in large groups called flocks.
Flocks consist of one to three related adult males along with as many as thirty females and cubs.
Females are often closely related to each other; a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lejob acts much like herds of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly for their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (but not well), swim, jump long distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is part of the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the noisy roar of the lion, but more like a sentence of growling, screaming words.
Ozelotes like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ozelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ozelots follow and find animals to eat (byte) via the smell, by sniffing the ground where they were.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and even move very stealthily. Ocelots chase their prey by blending into their surroundings and then plunging themselves over the prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) is separated from the main stock from which they originate (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily make their way back), they often end up in a different environment than the one they were previously in.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different features or adaptations than they needed before.
The indigenous population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to look less and less like the second population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and they take up carbon dioxide that humans emit (that is, exhale).
Plants produce food using sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make our clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is plants. Without the plants, the animals cannot survive.
The mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain during its time, so it had nothing to be afraid of, except other mosasauruses.
The long jaws were possessed with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the palate, meaning there was no chance of escape for anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibal.
It also attacked everything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their fair share of strange or unusual feasting items such as wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a kind of rodent called hazel mice.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they could half-lie on their side while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals may not have contained food that came to Europe from America or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, nor tomatoes, cocoa, or potatoes, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods which was considered to be the home of the god.
People brought offerings to the gods and the priests tried to appease the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only the priests had access.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, known as ziqqurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
Women cooked food in the yard; shops were just open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, therefore wood was very precious.
The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland as a punishment for murder, and that when he travelled west he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
"Although each country was ""Scandinavian"" there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland."
If you’ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there’s a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it is not true. Although it says something on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words ""Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776"". The text appears on the bottom of the document, upside down."
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we do know that the large parchment (with dimensions of 75.6 cm x 62.2 cm) was rolled up for storage early in its existence.
So it's likely that the text was just written there as a label.
The landings on Day D and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
"It was run by the Vichy French, who were French people who got along with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them."
"On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called ""Operation dragoon""".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the free French forces had liberated southern France and turned against Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means citizens, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which also in some way defines the size of society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture means that knowledge is transferred between several generations, a lingering cultural footprint and a fair spread.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and are not recognized as real civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - according to the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked all power to impose taxes and, since there was no national executive or judiciary, it fell to the authorities of the states, who were often uncooperative, to implement all of its decisions.
It also did not have the authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all states before they could be added and the states attached so little importance to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italian national football, along with the German football team, is the world's second most successful team and was champion of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller skating and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
With its many islands, Japan is often considered an archipelago in a geographical sense.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century when European sailors who passed by registered the island's name as Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch Eastern Indian Company founds a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiates a transformation of the original production of grain and employs Chinese workers to work on the rice and sugar plantation.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province by the Qing Empire.
After the defeat of 1895 in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which sovereignty over Taiwan is given to Japan, which then governs the island until 1945.
Machu picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they looked in the original.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still manufactured today, but even more important is its aspect ratio inherited to the formats of photo sensors in digital cameras.
The 35-millimeter format is, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio in this format (dividing by twelve to produce the simplest full-figure relationship) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as APS formats) correspond to this aspect ratio or are close to it.
The much-abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while keeping a certain order in an image.
It is argued that the best placement for the subject is where the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally meet (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was scrutinized.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had bound together European states despite their differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power affected everyone from king to common man.
One of the main tenets of Christianity states that wealth is to be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the funds of the church are for that very purpose.
The central power of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle was fulfilled.
Shortly after the conflict broke out, Britain began a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off necessary military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international agreements over the past two hundred years.
Britain mined international waters to prevent all ships from crossing entire areas of the sea, making it risky even for neutral ships.
Given a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited underwater warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude was pacifism and isolation of most residents and countries.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, countries wanted to avoid such a situation being repeated in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States of America in 1884 to work at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his former job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different time periods; each stage in China's history, or each family in power, was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable period in which the provinces were divided. The most famous of these periods were the Three Kingdoms, which took place between the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, violent warfare often took place between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest times in ancient China's history when thousands of people died in the battle to sit in the highest chair of the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not a single ruler.
Furthermore, the professions were opened up to all seeking men, allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same applies to the military, as ranks within the army were now based on caliber instead of on class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed people from the working class in other countries to make the revolution.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in subjects beyond his everyday life. He would often visit a cave that became known as ""Hira"" on the ""Noor""" mountain (light) to contemplate."
The cave itself, which survived the passage of time, gives a very clear picture of Mohammed’s spiritual inclinations.
The cave, located on one of the mountain peaks north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even if you know it exists. Inside the cave is total isolation.
There is nothing to see but the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exist today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Pyramid of Cheops is one of many great pyramidal structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
"The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of Death contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tomb monuments, several temples, and the Great Sphinx."
The Cheops Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
"The mark for ""up-straight"" looks like a V and the mark for ""down-straight"" looks like a staple or a square that has no bottom side."
Up means you should start at the tip and push the strings upwards, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand is holding the strings) and pull the strings downwards.
A string usually generates a softer sound, while a string is stronger and more resolute.
You may draw your own markings, but keep in mind that the printed string markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market women on 6 October 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a chariot surrounded by a crowd shouting and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows wide open.
On one occasion, one of the participants in the mob swung his head from an imperial guard killed at Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses for the conquest of the Philippines by American imperialism were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover most of the cost and interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the great gains stemming from the protracted exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of order.
The period in which events took place is often referred to as the High Middle Ages period of European history in the 11th to 14th centuries.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which formally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many different ideas in practice, from the fact that technology drives development or the technological imperative in the strict view that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic associated with the laws of nature and how they are manifested in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: that technology itself follows a trajectory that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has ""effects"" on societies that are original, rather than socially conditioned."
For example, one could say that the motorized car inevitably leads to the construction of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a small amount of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass possession of cars also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, leading to the invention of new technologies in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
The romance contained a large element of determinism originating with authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to this geography arose, and these, harmonizing with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began to circulate by about the year 400 AD and continued until about the year 1100 AD.
Its influence declined during the 14th century mainly due to the fact that crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued higher than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 12th-12th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to the slow communication routes, the styles of the West could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture that is carried out for the production of enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-catering farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses saved seeds originating in the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were self-sufficient farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by society and allow them to find their identity.
Subcultures may be distinct due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that determine a subculture as distinct may be of a linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical nature, or it may be a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic style selection, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, unhappiness, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
"Such children are called ""wild"". Some wild children have been locked up by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the parents rejecting a child's serious intellectual or physical disabilities."
Wild children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wilderness all on their own.
When the wild child is raised entirely by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical boundaries) almost entirely identical to those of the specific care animal, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, support teaching goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a support for individuals learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of support, but so is the little gem-man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalized in the software and is meant to question, guide and explain methods that may have been too challenging for the student to cope with on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for many different reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring or educational, but it does happen.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our family home system will provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
Foster homes are there to offer all the necessities that were missing in the home they used to come from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of user theory.
"For example, ""learning"" and ""socialization"" are proposed as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."
"Even ""personal engagement"" and ""continuous relationships"" were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites."
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial expressions lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
"Oliver Sacks showed in his writing "The President's Speech" how people who can't understand speech because of brain damage can still judge sincerity correctly."
He even claims that we share such knowledge in interpreting human behavior with animals such as domesticated dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of pronounced variation.
Segregation and recombination shovel variations back and forth between the two poles for each new generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like man to satisfy his need for amino acids from the plants available.
In addition, a lack of this has serious consequences; stunted growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest, unless they are cooked.
By comparison, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested, but also offer high-quality proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
"After all, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their ""protein problem"" in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today."
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you closer to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you usually turn off the clock in your sleep, you can set it at the other end of the room, so that you are forced to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before sleep, making one have to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has correlates oppositely to the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has expanded with the path of love within the Mahayana and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the all-encompassing path of love.
Kundalini yoga awakens the energy of kundalini (enlightenment energy) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The yoga of God is central to Tibetan meditation. Through visualization of different gods, the energy channels are purified, chakras activated and enlightened awareness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, the differences in system, process and culture led to the collapse of the countries' cooperation.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be physically fought through contract armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were already broken and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, having invaded the eastern regions of Poland and at the same time violated the Riga Peace Agreement, the Non-Aggression Pact between the Soviet Union and Poland and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
By far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the seas is to use ships to transport goods.
The job of the fleets has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while disrupting the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to move troops and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, mainly with the help of submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could probably have conquered Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have first been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes had them to get milk, fur, meat and skin.
Domesticated herds were usually kept in flocks that wandered on hills or other grazing areas, often herded by shepherds who were often children or youths, similar to the more famous sheep herd. These methods of herding are still used today.
Tramways for wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although wagon roads consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to achieve higher speeds and draw greater loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Slippers were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a layer of iron at the top.
This became the practice, but the iron tore more on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first rails entirely made of iron were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transportation was hiking, people started walking upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning the upright man) saw the light of day.
Their predecessor, australopithecus, was not in the habit of walking upright.
Bipedal specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can get involved in the environmental movement, and we can also become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases like symptomatic treatment. But if we do not just want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
It is clear that the world has changed greatly because of the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems have worsened because of overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of mankind.
After it had been adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printery a few blocks away.
"During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as ""Dunlap broadsides""."
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon at the Independence Hall farm on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had it read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 broadsides of Dunlap that are known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The handwritten original has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still exist today. We call them birds.
Many people don’t think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things in birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1 and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits for using computer jargon.
Internal poisoning is not always immediately noticeable. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The best sign of poisoning can be an open can of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term rams is used in the formal sense by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term is derived from ancient kinship with bedbugs, insects that are sharply adapted to parasitize on humans.
Both predatory skin beetles and bedbugs are bostanners, adapted to live in its host's nest or home.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest, or in the best interests of their child, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to establish an adoption plan for their child.
During an adoption, the biological parents waive their rights so that another couple may raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method is indicative in almost all research.
Experimenting, where an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions and make observations, also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the Western world found itself cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not just reactions to external periodic signals have been documented in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-propelled oscillator that repeats its cycle for a period of time even in the absence of external influence.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main hints that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to plant their own DNA in a bacterium.
They did two experiments that marked either the DNA of the substance with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the substance with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of experiencing the landscape, including its plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning more about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small rural towns in cars to go to their jobs and be passed by others whose destination for the work is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is somehow connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private motorism.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has disrupted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human development over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. In principle, everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, similar complaints about water quality or bridges are rarely heard.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because preparatory work cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
As is well, motorists tend to behave reasonably consistently; thus, traffic tends to flow at reasonably consistently and can be broadly presented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main variables: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These conditions help in the planning, design and operation of facilities along the roads.
The insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid the enemy more easily and to find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them more small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and dayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system was moving around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many believed the opposite; that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the sun (and also the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the world's most water-rich and second longest river. Its water flow is more than 8 times as large as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, 9 km wide in some places.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the Earth’s rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon River is 6,387 km. It gets its water gets thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids in Giza's size and construction technique were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the world's smallest independent country and the country with the lowest number of inhabitants.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and in official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known basic chemical substances such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, as these can be discovered in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything consisted of one or more of a total of four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four phases of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he had theories that they switch to new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many different elements in the periodic table.
Substances such as calcium and potassium are included in metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic substances such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit in the point at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a faithful companion for many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, when newer writing methods have been developed, the pencil has been given lower status and fewer uses.
Today, people write messages on computer screens, and never need to get near a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that it takes energy to produce a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Sort of like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, splitting the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei and it does not take much for them to disintegrate.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the far side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the nearby side because the crust is thinner there. This made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories revolve around finding out what gets people started or what appeals to them.
The theories claim that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they become adults.
These theories look at what makes some people want what they want and what in their environment it is that makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former peers. At one end of the spectrum, the manager tries to remain ""one in the gang"".
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, perform disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, assign responsibilities, and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognizable person who feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for whether the team succeeds or fails.
This behavior often results in gaps between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams hold the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members tend to act as a point of contact for the physical group.
They often have more say than conventional team members as different time zones can affect when their team can meet and this may not be understood by management locally.
"The presence of a real ""invisible team"" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."
"The ""invisible team"" is the management team that all members report to. The invisible team sets the standards for each member."
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One goal of starting to use organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in an organization's functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can thrive.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the needs of the customer.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to support organizations in achieving a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, it makes the field of research narrower and much more precise.
The correlation between brain diseases and behavior supports researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, diseases and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have not seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that includes machine behavior, learning, and intelligence.
Research in AI is about getting machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and also recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, which focus on offering solutions to real-world problems.
The AI system is now widely used in economics, medicine, technology, and the military, and has been built into several home computers and video game software applications.
Field studies are a large part of the teaching in each class. Often the teacher wants to take the students to places where there are no buses.
The technology offers solutions with virtual study visits. Students can look at museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art sitting with their class.
Sharing a study trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet school in North Carolina design each year a website about their trip to the state capital; the website is redesigned each year, but previous versions are allowed to remain online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of readers improves this in general.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to write better to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the outside world". The requirement to satisfy readers' interest stimulates students to be bright and interest-provoking (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"The appropriate use of blogs""can give students the opportunity to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet material, students can define their positions in relation to what others have written, as well as account for their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada’s charming bilingual capital and offers a range of galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s present and past.
Further south is Niagara Falls and in the northern part is Muskoka's beautiful, untouched nature.
All this and more distinguishes Ontario with what outsiders consider to be the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are very sparsely populated, and some are nearly uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent of its own in terms of fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or belong to France, and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the areas, which had a major impact in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope and thus found the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is good to also wear a ring (not just one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for someone to follow you, grab your arm, etc.
Be firm when you say no to men and don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don’t make it ok!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 11th century BCE and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city of Daru l-Badya which was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagine, ceramics, leather products, water pipes and a whole spectrum of crimson, but it all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the central parts.
Goma is fairly safe, but if you are going to visit outside Goma, you should investigate what it looks like with the fighting in the northern Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the volcano Nyiragongo along with some of the cheapest tracks of mountain gorilla in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price for the short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
"Combined with its relative unavailability, ""Timbuktu"" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, remote locations."
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was included in the list of threatened World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the major stops under Henry Louis Gates' PBS program Wonders of the African world.
The city stands in stark contrast to the other cities in the country, with an atmosphere that is Arabic rather than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile river.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozoons, each of which houses different wildlife.
It is one of the largest attractions in South Africa and it is considered to be the flagship among South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all other South African national parks, the park charges daily nature conservation and entrance fees.
It can also be beneficial to buy a Wild Card, which either gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists regard as the main focus.
The buildings in a row that make up the Hong Kong skyline have been likened to a glittering bar graph enhanced by the waters of Victoria's harbour.
To see the best views in Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon’s lakeside opposite.
The vast majority of the settlements on Hong Kong Island are tightly packed on the former seabed along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took over, so if you’re looking for evidence of the area’s colonial past, this is a great place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world and extends 80 km into Bangladesh and the Indian interior from the coast.
Sundarbans has been adopted on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps – they contain some of the last remaining stands of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km2, about one third of which consists of wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 Axis deer in the area.
Buses depart from the district-wide bus station (over the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, run between 6.30 and 7.30.
Since buses between the districs are often full, it is a good advice to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to places nearby, like Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers rise 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two aisles that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical free height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs stations are expected to be completed.
Guaraní was the most significant indigenous group that inhabited present-day eastern Paraguay and lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was populated by other groups of native tribes such as Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived as hunters, gatherers and fishermen.
"In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "giant province of India", was born as a result of the meeting of the Spanish conquerors and groups from the indigenous peoples. "
The Spanish began the colonization period which lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known because their polo teams and players are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December at the polo courts in Las Canitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here during other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets for polo matches, please turn to Asociacion Argentina de polo.
The official Falklands currency is the Falklands Pound (FKP) whose value corresponds to the value of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
GBP is generally accepted everywhere in the islands, and within Stanley it is often possible to pay by credit card and USD.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on the remote islands, but UK and US currency may be accepted; contact the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; during the summer months temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
"There are no special "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year."
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you should stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other wildlife!
However docile they may appear, bison, elk, kanda deer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep adequate distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking food that smells and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia, which is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of an infamous standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser, nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of Supreme Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches due to Auckland's location between two ports. The most popular beaches are divided into three areas.
The shores of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and on most, the Maori ant offers shade.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes well-attended family beaches with a good selection of shops located on the beach. Swimming is safe.
"The main local beer is ""Number one"", which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called ""Manta""."
There are many French wines, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may make the trip better.
The local drinking water is completely risk-free to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you’re worried.
"For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is unknown. A ""short black"" is ""espresso"", cappuccino has a pile of cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk."
The hot chocolate milk meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
There are many trips to the reef all year round and damage due to any of these causes on the reef is rare.
Nevertheless, take the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and be very attentive to safety warnings.
Cube jellyfish occur near beaches and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes also be found at other times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
The main habitat of the saltwater crocodile is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton, so they do not usually live in the sea.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind and an assurance that they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with special hotels, but it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transfers to and from the airport, and even package tours that combine flights and hotels.
They can also reserve your booking for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or obtain additional documents required for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, all changes and requests should go through the travel agency first, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors decide to camp on site, and most visitors see it as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to where things happen, you need to come early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even though the music performances on the main stage have ended, parts of the festival can continue to play music until late into the night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, because walking through ice causes really terrible noises for those who are most affected.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually do everything they can to get guests to spend as much time and money as possible. There are often no windows or clocks, and the exits are often hard to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and make them stay in the venue.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages for free. But intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware that snow, ice and temperatures below freezing may occur.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can’t drive in the same way as on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, in a very short time, enough snow can fall for you to get stuck.
Visibility can also be limited by snowfall or snowy weather or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted year-round.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourism industry in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to trips across the country to see the amazing African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and with standard equipment it is possible to see them well.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with binoculars.
"Walking safari (also called "bush walk" and "hiking safari") consists of hiking either for a few hours or for several days."
The Paralympics will take place between 24 August and 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to host two Summer Olympics, since it hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the launch was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies related to the coronavirus look different, but by the end of March most do not extend as far as July 2020, when the Olympic Games would have begun.
It is expected that most tickets for events will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a typical fare around 7,000 yen.
Ironing of damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if it is not in the room.
If no iron is available, or if you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be vigilant and do not let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are different sets to clean water on, and some are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others several minutes are required.
Filters can vary in efficiency, and if you are unsure then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from an established company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not usually classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the ability to purchase goods without tax or other supplements at certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The route between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often runs through isolated primeval forest terrain.
If you’re not used to driving on country roads, drive wisely: steep gradients, narrow lanes, and sharp curves are common.
Set speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 56-64 km/h (35-40 mph) - and that they are followed is even more important than otherwise.
Oddly enough, mobile coverage is much better here than along many other routes, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are really good, and in Bavaria they are quite powerful and varied, similar to those from the neighbor in the south, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common, with apples baked in pastries all year round as well as cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German pastries also have almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but powerful pastries, you can try what depending on the region is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
"A curry can be either ""dry"" or ""moist"" depending on the amount of liquid."
In northern India and the inland regions of Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other of the subcontinent's coastal regions, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a collective name that includes a wide variety of regional cuisines spread around the country.
However, if used without a determinant, the term tends to mean the food that originally came from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now available everywhere in the archipelago, offers a variety of simply spiced dishes, where the flavorings that the Javanese use most are peanuts, chili, sugar (in particular Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Ladders are support for the rider's feet that hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can pose a safety risk as the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown by a horse but is caught with one foot in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders have boots with heels and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that make sure a stirrup disengages from the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a rider falling off.
The Cochamó Valley, Chile's main climbing destination, is known as South America's Yosemite, and has a number of large granite cliffs and walls.
The mountain tops offer views that can take your breath away. Climbers from all corners of the world are constantly creating new routes among the countless mountain walls.
Downhill skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports where you slide down a snowy landscape with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is an activity that attracts many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski bums", who plan the entire holiday trip around skiing in a particular area.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5,000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport has been around at least since the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: this activity is also called backcountry skiing, tour skiing or ski hiking.
It is related to but does not usually involve alpine skiing or mountain climbing, the latter being performed in steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as on a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to manage slightly greater distances than when walking – but you will only rarely get up to speeds like when cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack in groomed tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries; under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control on a number of occasions.
However, the Schengen area functions much like a country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without having to undergo passport checks again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen member state separately, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limits may be shorter in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are not as old as similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sami and the culture that surrounds trade is important for many with other professions as well.
Historically, however, not all Sami have been involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but have lived from fishing, hunting and the like and used the reindeer mostly as draught animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami area.
"Although it is often used, especially among non-Romani, the word ""gypsies"" is often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of Romani people."
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to a travel restriction, your travel health insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also wish to consult governments other than your own, but their advice is designed for their own residents.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may have different circumstances compared to Europeans or Arabs.
A travel advice is just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The image presented is often fast, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available from elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for all dangerous weather phenomena with the potential to cause injury, severe social disruption or the loss of human life.
Severe weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different variations of them, which can be due to geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall, and wildfires are the types and consequences of extreme weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, cloudbursts, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include fierce blizzards, blizzards, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of severe weather affecting their area, as it can affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
"A search on the Internet for ""hostile environmental education"" will probably give the address of a local company."
A course usually goes through all the questions mentioned here but in much more detail, usually with practical exercises.
A course normally lasts between 2-5 days and includes role-playing, much first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are plenty of books on how to survive in the wilderness, while books dealing with war zones are rare.
Travelers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they hold valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports without specified gender (X) or documents updated to match a desired name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies just as much.
Scans at security checkpoints have also become significantly more intrusive in the post-11 September 2001 era.
Transgender persons who have not undergone an operation should not expect to be able to pass through the X-ray check with integrity and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the returning flow from waves that break off at the shore, often at a reef or similar.
The topology under the water allows the backflow to be concentrated into a few deeper parts, and strong currents that lead to deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion after attempting to swim back countercurrently, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the stream, it’s no more difficult than normal to swim back.
Try to aim somewhere where you won’t get stuck again or, depending on your skills and on whether you’ve been spotted, wait to be rescued.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (there is not as much of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to new cultures sometimes find it difficult to adapt to their original culture.
When you return from living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, because of the knowledge that travelers in a new country have to adapt.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The Pyramids Sound and Light Show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the performance begins.
Usually you always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The sound and light story is just like a storybook.
The background is the Sphinx, which tells a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the various pyramids become illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries, and they have the most bases, of which sixteen are active by 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the community of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception where the flooded crater of an active volcano forms a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth's land is the region south of the peninsula, and borders the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains merge here with the plateau and then return to form the 360-mile-long Ellsworth Mountain Range, which is split in half by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range has Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, with a highest peak of 4,892 m in Mount Vinson.
In remote locations without cellular coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a mobile phone, as you have to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that need remote data and voices.
Your local telecommunications provider should be able to provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
Traveling and learning is an increasingly popular option for those planning a free year.
This is particularly popular among recent graduates, allowing them to take a year off before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a sabbatical course abroad can actually increase the chances of getting into a higher education in your home country.
Usually, a fee is charged to register on these teaching programs.
Finland is very boat-friendly. The land of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelagos.
In the archipelago and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos and the largest lakes are really big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak can offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the specifically Baltic cruises include a longer stopover in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days while returning to and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you are only going ashore with ship excursions, you do not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some cruises include the German capital Berlin in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by air can be a frightening experience for people, regardless of age and background, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fear and dislike of other things that very many people have.
Understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help some people overcome a fear that is due to discomfort in the face of the unknown or to not being in control.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important when it comes to business documents, merchandise or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If they have sent items by air freight, on some routes it may have taken several days to go through unloading and customs.
The only way to get there faster was to send it as checked baggage. The airline rules do not allow you to send luggage without a passenger, and this is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first class or business class is to shell out a whole lot of money for the privilege (or better yet, let your company do it for you).
However, this does not come at a cheap price: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy price for business and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no point in even looking for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of travelers who are prepared to pay well for the privilege of traveling somewhere quickly and comfortably. Companies also charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any member state of the United Nations.
Economic relations have been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite failures in the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of around 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
The city, historically known as Smyrna, is today a modern, developed city and a lively commercial center located at a huge harbor surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres are mixed with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more like Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery there are interesting marble statues of pigeons over some of the graves.
It is worth strolling around half an hour in the captivating village.
Within reach to the north is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after a shimmering account of its magnificence by Lord Byron.
Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
To the north, also visit the amazing Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (sanctuary), a place world-famous for the revelations of Mary.
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass graveyard and a place that has an almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women still alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death here; Jews as well as non-Jews.
Use the site with the great dignity, solemnity and respect that it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the site by painting or scraping graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, an overwhelming majority understand it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, as it is by law the primary official language.
However, Spanish is also used in many places in public transport and other establishments.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
"Although this is often just a false stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to behave in the best way and behave like someone who is ""bien élevé"" (well-behaved). It will make it much easier to get around."
The brusque appearance of the Parisians will quickly disappear if you show yourself from your polite side.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is overgrown with dense forest, the main part with beech, spruce and noble spruce, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a strikingly large species richness, due to the extent of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitude differences.
The area is also home to an extreme diversity of animal and bird species.
Rare animal species such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and feather are found there, along with many more common species
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees, and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries give shawls to women who have not prepared in advance, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
According to the same logic, men must dress in trousers that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the warehouse in the entrance but those garments are not washed after every person so you may not feel comfortable using these skirts. One size fits all applies to men!
Mallorcan food, like that in similar areas around the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses throughout olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato, and optional available accessories such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as Sie for the pronoun ni, are written with a capital beginning letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important method of distinguishing between certain verbs and objects.
According to some, it also makes it easier to read, although the need to find out if a verb or adjective is in noun form makes writing slightly more complicated.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies on the basis of the following vowel.
Also make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means wagon.
Persian has relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, you can get good help in learning a lot about Persian grammar and understand sentences better if you read this basic grammar book.
Of course, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese if you already know a Romance language.
However, people who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it does not need to be studied separately.
Premodern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution during their heyday was not the kind of problem they are today, they are usually found in cities or on university campuses, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote locations with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami, or the view of the cherry blossom, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum flowers were used.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom feasts were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so try to resist the temptation to remove “just one” specimen.
"If you visit an arranged garden, and you pick a ""sample""" it will even get you evicted, without discussion."
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to stay and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after arrival.
"But with its location in the ""high tropics"" just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely)."
There are also a small number of buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial ground where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives rest.
Make sure the bus that you are thinking of taking goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good starting point to base a holiday around.
For example, visit castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or take a boat trip to interesting cities on the Danube or a trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions around the weekend have also been taken up by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake at any open place to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter night Mass on Saturday evening during the Easter holiday. At midnight, the church then breaks up to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived in the islands came here by either swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not cross, and so the giant turtle became the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since man arrived in the Galápagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience polar nights, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good time to see the northern lights, as the sky is dark more or less around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution thus often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners might be used to.
Costume is the normal business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or by job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, putting the emphasis on joint efforts rather than highlighting individual performance.
Workers must often obtain the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make and are expected to follow the instructions of their superiors without hesitation.
