Crying out to the world
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland has gone well and cries and calls out in the wild are starting to attract people far and wide around the world.
“You have the puzzle, I need Iceland,” says a woman in the big world in comments on a YouTube ad from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland.
Another observer says goodbye will keep Iceland in her heart for all eternity, and a young woman says she must go to Iceland as soon as possible, because her fiancé lives there.
Unfortunately, she’s still in the US, so she’ll have to wait a few more months.
Another observer asks if the route to Iceland is a good one, because there are no planes.
I don't know if it comes from another time zone.
Egil Thorðarson of the advertising agency Peel, who made the ads together with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says that receptions have been hoped for more.
“I came across many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well, but this new campaign is already breaking records.
Basically, this is about creating PR value, it's getting foreign media to cover the campaign, and it's been going incredibly well.
Over a relatively short period of time, we have received coverage in about seven hundred media outlets around the world, totaling more than two billion people.
The value of that coverage is valued at ISK 1.8 billion.
That's not bad."
The main market is the United States and the campaign has been very successful there even though the Americans are not on their way to the country soon.
According to Egils, well-known market areas such as Denmark, the UK and Germany have also welcomed, like Russia, which is a pleasant surprise.
Then there were reactions from foreign regions, such as India, which were not specifically laid out.
“These ads have traveled far beyond our expectations,” says Egill, who may have watched more than four million people on YouTube.
“We couldn’t have asked for a better start.”
The photos here at the opening included Årni Sæberg, photographer of the Morning Post, taking pictures of advertisements entitled "Let It Out" in the middle of last month.
The events took place far and wide, such as on the Reykjavík School Guard Trail, in Reynisfjöra, at Skógarfoss, at Sólheimajökull and in a cave at Hjörleifshöfa.
The directors were Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll álafsson at Skoti productions and the cameraman of Uttar Guðnason.
The cast included the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who are from Cuba and Hungary.
Dozens of Icelanders came to the making of the advertisements, but at the same time recordings took place in South Iceland there was another group in West Iceland and the Westfjords.
According to Egils, "Let It Out" is only the first part of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but it is aimed at a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
“This is just the first phase of this work for the Icelandic agency,” says Egill, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has gone very well.
“It’s great to work with them.
In such projects, it is very important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to."
Explosives: Discussing the situation in the labor market, pension funds and much more
Asmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children, will attend Sprengisand, which starts at 10 a.m. today.
He is also Minister of Labour and discusses the position on the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and other issues.
He also discusses rural issues and migration work out of a country that has gone badly and been controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Thor Ingólfsson, chairman of VR, will also attend the event, but he will discuss his criticisms regarding investments by pension funds and will present ideas for labor movements and employers to pull out of the fund's boards to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
Ivar Ingimarsson, a tourism manager in East Iceland, and Årnheiði Jóhannsdóttir, director of the Nordic Market Office, will then discuss the situation in tourism in the countryside.
They will look ahead to the fall and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading premonition of what is to come.
You can listen to the show below, but it starts at 10 a.m.
This is what it looks like 25 years later.
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in teen shows of all kinds.
However, she was world famous for her role as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49, married with one child.
Little has worn her lately, but she was able to look over the road and comment on Clueless on Australian television in the days.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she was a great person.
“I have to admit that I mostly based the character on girls I met in school who were not nice to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this character was," said Donovan about his play in Clueless.
I didn’t want to leave the police station.
About fifty cases came on board the police in the capital area today, saying in the police diary that the cases were varied.
The day at the police station in Hverfisgata started with the police having to be involved with a man who had then been recently released from a prison cell after staying there due to drunk driving.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not obey police instructions telling him to leave.
The man earned a continued stay at the police station because of his conduct.
A man was arrested in the morning on suspicion of breaking into a company in Kópavogur.
Police also had to be involved with two men in Breiðholt due to reports of assault.
A woman sitting at a shopping mall in Kópavogur was also unable to pay for the bill after a meal and was therefore called to the police.
A car was also reported stolen in the city centre this morning.
The driver of a white Renault transponder looked at her for a moment and she was then taken by a free hand.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the Gladiators - The Horrible Fate of the Glade Stars
The theory has flown on the Internet that a curse rests on the series about the Joy Squad, but actress Naya Rivera drowned in California in the days leading up to becoming the third main cast member of the show to let her life go long.
The Glee series is a popular series about singing, dancing, and joy.
These included the so-called youth joy squad in high school, their loves, and their fate.
It wasn’t always easy being in the group, but through singing and dancing, the characters of the show seemed to overcome whatever circumstances arose in their lives.
But outside of filming locations, major disasters have plagued the actors and employees of the show, so much so that theories have awoken that the curse rests on the show.
Naya Marie Rivera took on the role of Sandra Lopez in the show, a cheerleader who didn't call her whole grandmother.
After the series had run its course, Rivera went on to have actor Ryan Dorsey and had with him his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently divorced them.
However, Dorsey refused to file a complaint and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8, it was reported that Rivera was missing after her four-year-old son was found alone drifting in a boat on Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life vest on board the boat, and he was able to report to police authorities that he and his mother had gone swimming, and then Rivera would have gotten him back in the boat but never returned there herself.
Excited extensive search for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the local police chief reported that we were searching assuming that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially pronounced dead.
It is believed that she had a great deal of stress in the water and used her last claim to save the son.
The cause of death was recorded drunk by accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the episodes, the American football player with the angel voice playing a key role in bringing the Gladiator to the cause and respect.
Outside of the show, however, Moneith wrestled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape it.
In 2013, his colleagues on the show felt enough, intervened, and urged him to seek help.
Moneith then went into treatment and everything seemed to be looking for better ways.
Only two months after completing his treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Banamein turned out to be a lethal mix of drugs and alcohol.
It was not thought to be a will work.
Moneith had been treated and his tolerability to drug donors had decreased so much that a dose he had previously tolerated well proved fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was heavy on his colleagues, but on the basis of his counterpart, Lea Michele, it was decided to continue the filming of the episodes, devoting them to the whole part of Moneith's memory and that of Finn's character.
Mark Wayne Salling took the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman on the show, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the Joy Squad, or all until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his Los Angeles home on suspicion of custody of child pornography.
During a house search at his home, a huge amount of child pornography was found, and the matter was soon questioned publicly.
It was obvious that Salling had been there.
He was subsequently charged and convicted of his crimes.
He faced four to seven years in prison as well as being required to be on the list of sex offenders and seek treatment for childishness.
Before a judge had determined the punishment, Salling, then free on bail, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It wasn’t just the actors who fell from age to age.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
He fell asleep in 2013 at the age of 41.
The show also featured a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of great star Julia Roberts and did not carry her sister's beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of great governance and disrespectful behavior.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she struggled with severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiancé, saying her mother and sister, among other things, were responsible for how she was treated.
“My mother and my so-called siblings get nothing from me except the memory that it was they who caused my worst depression.”
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of using her co-stars to bully and bully at a filming location and of having an overwhelming star rating.
Jesse Luken made a guest appearance on the show in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with intoxicating driving in 2019, which was considered a major scandal.
Actress Heather Morris played a major role in the show.
She was hit in 2010 by unbridled computer thugs getting in nude photos of her and publishing on the Internet.
Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both starred in the show and had an affair outside of the show.
Benoist later reported that Jenner abused her in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost anything.
It increases the development of children when they get to play outside in a garden with their parents growing flowers and getting to watch them grow and prosper.
It is also endlessly possible to do with flowers as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Spending time with your children in the garden is something that will never be forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance, and of course the precious time they had with their parents.
I bought a boat in 10th grade.
“I don’t think there are many sailors working in the country’s kindergartens,” says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who does beach fishing in the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter season.
Beach fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you are in school.
If well fished, you can have good income and I think it's great to be able to skip taking a student loan.
The incomes are also good for me in the winter," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student, who does beach fishing in the summer as in recent summers.
Axel was most recently docked in Tálknafjörður when a journalist got a speech from him late in the evening at the beginning of the week."
“The winter I was in the tenth grade, I took ship control rights for boats less than twelve meters long, and I bought my boat the summer after I graduated from primary school.
I have been fishing on my boat ever since.
I bought the boat used by my friend, Hartmann Jonsson, and I named the boat his name.
Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and ceased to exist at sea, and he was very happy when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
“I signed a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer and the other half at the end of the summer after I had gone fishing.
So I had the boat debt free at the end of my first summer on him."
But how could a boy have a million and a half to pay out in a boat when he had just finished elementary school?
“I had already put in and collected money, I had been working with my dad to sea when I was a boy, I was all summer fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my wallet in my wallet.”
Axel was born in Isafjörður, from where all his mother people are, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
“I can fish here in the western area because I have a legal residence at my grandmother’s house in Isafjordur.
I learned in this area here west of rowing with my dad.
I move between distances depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers the entire Westfjords.
Although I prefer to stay in the west, I have also been around the Snæfellsnes and beyond.
I have also provided for the south but then prefers a grayling," says Axel, who always starts one early in the morning and sometimes says he talks to the seagulls and sings to the sky, during the solitary hours spent out at the ballpark.
“The internet is great, so I can make calls, listen to podcasts and listen to music.
I don’t feel like I’m alone in the boat.
Of course I try to avoid getting into danger, but certainly occasionally something has been wrong, but never a big risk," says Axel, who is lucky that he is never seasick.
He says the length of the workday depends on how the hunts are going each time.
“In the coastal fishery, I’ve never been more than 14 hours fishing at a time, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental quota, but then I’ve been continuously for one and a half days in the bait at sea to fish.”
The arrangement in coastal fishing says he is allowed to catch 770 kilograms per day, which he finds inhibiting.
“Other restrictions are that I can’t catch Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I can only catch 12 days a month, these four months of coastal fishing, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their fishing days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on people to calm down instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and can choose according to their head.
So could the regional division go to me as well, and a sealock that is well located at the fishing spot should get to enjoy it," says Axel, who mostly pulls cod from the salty sea on his coastal fishing, but also only the weeds and unique other species float along.
Axel works over the winter with his university studies at the kindergarten Núpi in Kópavogur.
“I don’t think there are many sailors working in the country’s kindergartens,” says Axel proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily at the kindergarten.
“I get stuck there because I think it’s a great job.
I hope that my psychology studies will benefit me in the future at the kindergarten level," says Axel, who is also well advanced in business studies.
An error in the registration prevented the return mite
An error in a registration form that people fill out when they enter the country resulted in a person living in this country not being called back for sampling.
It is not a requirement to register the identification number if the person fills out the form in English, as is the case when it is done in Icelandic.
“This will be looked at this week,” says an expert in the field of infectious diseases.
Three people were diagnosed at the hospital yesterday.
One of those who turned out to be positive came to the country on July 15, two days after the rules on so-called return mitigating measures came into force.
Those who lived in Iceland are then screened on arrival and again announced in a sampling four to five days later.
It was reported in the local news that the old system had been followed.
The sample on the border was negative and it was not called back in screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, an expert in the field of infectious diseases, says in a conversation with a news agency that this may be due to an error in the electronic registration sheet.
If people fill out the registration form in English, it is not a condition to enter the ID number as is the case in the Icelandic version.
First and foremost, it was designed for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person did not receive an automatic invitation to come for sampling.
However, Kamilla says many have followed the rules on return migratory portals even though they filled the registration form in English and in some cases employers have also been alert to send people back to sampling after they arrived in the country.
“This week will look at how to make it easier for people to get their attention on the process.”
The man is in solitary confinement and six have been placed in quarantine.
They all went to a sampling, but two were beginning to show symptoms.
A smear is currently underway with the three infections detected yesterday, but it is largely completed due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, the sequencing of Icelandic genetic analyses has revealed that there are variants of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In the second case, the ties have focused on Israel, although it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be for tomorrow where the other virus was coming from.
A total of 15 are currently in isolation according to the COVID.is web site.
135 is in the pipeline.
Four out of five infections are unrelated
Five domestic infections have been detected in this country in recent days.
Of these, four are completely unrelated and have not yet been found the origin of the infection that emerged at the Rey Cup sports tournament yesterday.
Texture is still ongoing.
Originally, on the third dozen were individually sent into quarantine, but they were reduced to sixteen.
A total of 34 people are infected due to these new infections, which were diagnosed yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period of time that an infection is detected at a sporting event and it has raised questions about whether such an event should be held.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, Director of Communications at the Civil Protection Division of the National Police, says it well slowly, as long as people follow the norms and rules.
“We are constantly urging all those who live here that it is necessary to maintain individual infectious disease prevention.
We also need to make it clear to people who are holding events that there are certain rules that need to be followed.
Then you can have an event," says John.
He says that the prevention of infection can be achieved by holding up individual infectious agents.
In addition, the rules and regulations are subject to constant review.
“What needs to be done, and what the Department of Public Health and the National Health Service are constantly pressing for people, is to consider these individual infectious diseases.
Both at home and at home, as well.
People wash their hands and use alcohol.
It prevents the infection from progressing," says Jóhann.
“We need to encourage people to continue on the good road we were on in order to sustain the success we have achieved so far.”
40% of COVID-19 victims had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how difficult it was for her father to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes, so she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day he was dead.
The death was attributed to sudden breathing difficulties due to chronic viral infection.
Diabetes was listed on the death certificate as an underlying problem, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that it might as well go away.
The Reuters news agency says Brumfield's fears are not unfounded.
A recent study by the U.S. government shows that nearly 40% of those who have died from diabetes 2 as an underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached the age of 65 is considered, the proportion rises to half.
A study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) included more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease specialist at the CDC, says the findings are striking, not least for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
Was hidden in the slow growth Reuters had a survey and suggest the answers from the 12 states that responded to similar rates.
10 states, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet begun to report underlying diseases.
“Sickness was already a slow-growing epidemic.
Now COVID "19 has broken through like a powerful century," has Reuters by Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American descent, who have also gone worse out of the coronavirus.
One of the best defenses for those with diabetes 2 is keeping the disease at bay with exercise, a healthy diet, and the help of a healthcare professional.
However, the coronavirus epidemic has made it difficult for many people to keep a routine.
Then the high price of insulin has forced some to continue to show up for work, thereby risking exposure to the virus.
Reuters notes that US authorities may have been aware of the risk that those with diabetes 2 could be caused by the virus.
As the SARS coronavirus passed in 2003, more than 20% of those with the disease and in the 2009 swine flu pandemic, this group was three times more likely to be hospitalized.
When MERS did so in 2012, one study found that 60% of those who died or were admitted to intensive care had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a researcher at Yale University, says that because the effects of the COVID-19 virus could last longer, the outbreak has removed the cover from a number of previously unknown complications.
“I’m afraid we’ll see a tsunami of problems when this is over,” said Andrew Bolton, chairman of the International Diabetes Association.
Physicians have warned that the coronavirus epidemic may indirectly lead to an increase in complications associated with diabetes, including kidney disease and kidney dialysis.
Similarly, new research suggests that the coronavirus may lead to an increase in diabetes mellitus.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lung, and kidney, organs that are already diseased in many people with diabetes.
Then a high proportion of glucose and lipids in diabetics can produce a true "cell signal storm", as it is called when the immune system reacts too harshly and attacks the body.
Damaged epithelial cells can also lead to inflammation, which in turn can cause fatal blood clots.
“It’s all one big puzzle,” says Dela Cruz.
“It’s all related.”
The news has been corrected.
“We were offered champagne, then they left the room.”
The couple Asrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason had the unusual request from the artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work the artist was putting up in Paris.
“We loved each other so it wasn’t difficult.”
Atli Bollason never forgets when he first met his wife and child mother, Asrunu Magnúsdóttir.
“I was very impressed by her.
It was just the light of day, but I also thought it was pretty cool.
And yet, he says.
This is also something that my husband remembers on a regular basis.
“I’ve always heard this story.
“It’s just the weekend,” she said, as she was attracted to her husband at first.
“I felt and feel so much excitement around Atla, which I love.
There’s a lot going on and I’m excited about it.”
Atli says that the couple has emphasized it in their relationship to go their own way.
“We don’t tie our bags to the same knots as our fellow travellers.
We avoid the routines that we branch out around us."
It is possible that they took the message from Ragnar Kjartansson, a visual artist just cheering, although it would be mildly unusual.
“Kristin Anna, a mutual friend of ours, contacts us and asks if we can come to eat desert with her, Ragga and Ingibjörg, Ragnar’s wife, at Snaps.”
They accepted the invitation, met the trio at Snaps and had dessert wine and each dessert.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans for an art exhibition he planned to put on at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris this fall.
“He had a multi-channel video called Scenes from Western Culture.
He described it in a simple way."
Asrún says that he described the work as a banal and decadent scene from the everyday life of Westerners.
"He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot and last he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating."
The scene in which Ragnar asked the couple to participate was to show a young middle-class couple making love in a minimalist room.
“It’s the beginning and the end,” he said.
The couple didn't know much about Ragnar, although they knew about him and him, but they knew us and felt we fit in.
They said they didn’t want to advertise.
Maybe they thought they wouldn't get the right people, but people who get sexually aroused from performing for others."
They urged Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn't take long.
“When we broke up with Snaps, we said, ‘Don’t we just exist?’
It was just so.
I trust Ragnari as an artist and all his team," says Osrún and Atli agrees.
“It’s about love and friendship.”
The scene was filmed in a nice apartment on Myrargata.
There were very few film crews; cameraman, Ragnar and soundman and the couple.
After the recording had been turned on, everyone left the room to wait outside in a car except Atli and Asrún.
“We haven’t decided how we should be.
We got some directions but we tried to forget the moment and the place.
Being unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
It wasn't a game, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," Usurn says.
But was it romantic?
"Yes, it was a bit romantic," says Atli and Osrún agree.
“We were offered champagne before they left the room.
It was a bit like being on holiday in a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was pleased with the couple's performance in the work that moved them.
"When Tommi the cameraman looked at this, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful," says Atli.
“It’s as much about love and intimacy as it is about relationships,” says Osrún.
The couple's parents have seen the work and tell Atli that his mother heard the voice in the son at Reykjavík Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
"Then she turns around and starts to pay attention to this," says Atli.
My mom and dad saw it in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone like that, but then my dad just sent me a message and said, 'Nice to run into the little family at the Palais de Tokyo,'" recalls Usurin.
Do you think the relationship between the two of you has deepened?
“At least we’re still together, so maybe it deepened something.
This at least deepened my relationship with the in-laws," says Osrún and laughs.
He saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleagues.
“I found it a little hard not to be with you but someone else,” she says, turning to her husband.
"But it was nice to see this because it's just one scene in a much bigger work and when you saw this with the other works it's very nice.
I was able to get away from it and I was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my stomach," says Osrun, who was pregnant with the second child of the couple when the scene was recorded.
“It was just beautiful.”
Anna Marsibil Clausen talked to them Osrúna and Atla in Love Stories at Rás 1.
Swansea win in the first round
Swansea won a 1–0 victory over Brentford in a dramatic match.
It was the teams' first game in the playoffs to reach the English Premier League.
The match took place at Swansea's home ground in Wales.
The score in the half was 0-3.
The Swansea homers got a penalty in the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew failed the bowlist off the penalty point and had his defence defended.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, Brentford's player, received the red card.
Brentford therefore played the rest of the game a man fewer and in the 82nd minute Swansea players took advantage of the team difference.
Andre Ayew then added up the wicket by scoring a fantastic goal, securing Swansea a 1–0 win.
Swansea therefore lead 1–0 in the duel, but the second game takes place next Wednesday at Brentford's home ground.
5 years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador to Iceland, is in the spotlight of the media after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard as he feared for his life.
However, it has not been easy for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador to this country.
Since Carol Van Voorst left the post of U.S. ambassador in April 2009, the country has been without ambassadors for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst left office in a peculiar situation, but Kastlyst reported in 2009 that she should have been given the Medal of Honor.
On the way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a phone call from the President's Office stating that she would not be honored by the word.
After her departure from Iceland, she taught international relations at Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor came to work, in September 2010.
It is partly due to Robert S. Connan having been appointed as ambassador, but then he retired.
At the time of the job, Loius Ariega had been working in the Foreign Service for decades.
He then resigned in the fall of 2013 and took up the post of ambassador to Guatemala.
Then another ambassador-less period took place.
Robert Barber received the approval of the U.S. Congress in January 2015 and came into office soon after, by which time no ambassador had been on the scene for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed, not a diplomat, but he had served as a lawyer and supported Barack Obama's campaign fund.
He left office as soon as Donald Trump took office, January 20, 2017, as usual with a politically appointed ambassador.
The Trump administration was unusual in assigning both ambassadors and senior officials to the Washington administration.
It took two years for the United States Congress to announce Jeffrey Ross Gunter to his meeting to ask him the questions and confirm that he has completed his duties as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony in parliament, he said he had never come to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who is dead, had been of Dutch rock broken.
Gunter is a political appointee, formerly a California dermatologist, and has been prominent in the Jewish organization of the Republican Jewish Coalition.
Gaming owner Sheldon Adelson founded the organization, but Adelson is an ardent supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter entered service in Iceland in May 2019, at which time no ambassador had been in Iceland since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest known example in Iceland.
The reason is both the length of time Trump's administration was nominating people in key positions as well as the fact that in recent years the work of the United States Congress has drawn heavily on, including confirming ambassadors in office.
Since 2009, Iceland has been without ambassadors for more than five years.
However, it has not prevented operations on the way of the embassy which opened a new headquarters at Engjateig.
The construction is estimated to have cost around $6.5 billion, but narrow security walls surround the building and bulletproof glass is in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have enough to fill the current ambassador's sense of security because he is said to fear for his life and has requested an armed bodyguard.
Former IBV player was exposed to racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, a former IBV player, says he has experienced racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets coming to the country.
This is stated in an interview with Tonny, which appears on Ugandan media Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC as a player in Uganda's top division.
In the interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time in Iceland, but he played with IBV, Val and Róttir in Iceland.
“When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle like I used to play.
The team's captain was in that position but in addition he also had the jersey number I wanted so I got neither of what I wanted," says Tonny, but he played on the right side of the season with IBV.
One of the things that Tonny talks about is the racism he experienced in Iceland.
This is a problem that many black players face when playing in Europe.
“It happened to me once, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was being said to me.
Then I heard about it and asked my friend what it was about.
He then told me that my opponent made racist comments about me after I beat him up."
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland for Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
He makes the mistakes he sees most of all.
Tonny had not been able to make it to the starting team at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to make it to the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but he then joined Val.
“It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had stayed longer in Norway I would have had the chance I wanted," says Tonny, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway he would probably get further.
He wants to say that the loan to Iceland was made out of his dreams of getting into a big team in Europe.
Find a worm in a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8-inch long black worm in a woman's neck gland that searched there.
Doctors managed to pull the worm out with pliers.
A study found that parasites were involved.
CNN is reporting on this.
The woman had eaten sashimi a few days earlier, which are thin cuts of meat.
The woman quickly recovered after the worm was removed, but parasites such as these are often in raw meat or fish.
After sushi surged to space in the West, cases of parasites having spread to people have increased, according to CNN.
Fear that another wave is about to begin in Europe
Spain is currently focusing on concerns about the second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, where the government has taken action to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic once again.
In Catalonia, all the entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where the number of infections is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action because of the increase in infections in Spain, but in the UK everyone has to go on sick leave on their return from Spain, as in Norway, and France has been warned about travel to Spain.
Infections are also on the rise again in France and Germany, as governments try to find a balance in curbing the spread of the virus and relaunching the economy.
The situation in Europe is, however, good compared to other parts of the world, but the number of infections globally is approaching 300 000 per day, which is the highest in the Americas and South Asia.
Confirmed infections have reached 16 million worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University count, and deaths confirmed to be related to the virus have reached 644,000.
The Mob Finally Gets to Enjoy Its Perfection
In front of the Toll House in Reykjavík is a large and deep hole.
On top of it are men wearing orange helmets.
There is also a large cemetery.
And more smaller machines.
The street is closed to traffic.
But the pavement is capable, and there many people are now dwelling and viewing works of art from millions of mosaic tiles – as if they had never seen it before.
Maybe they’ve never seen it before.
At least not worth it.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, right in front of it were parking lots that were always occupied.
People lay there, locked the car in a hurry, and then jumped off to do their errands in the city centre.
"Affordable and diverse public spaces" and "attractive cityscapes" are a guiding light in the currently ongoing reconstruction of Tryggvagata.
The goal is to enhance the area and allow the mosaics of the Toll House to enjoy a better view.
In front of the work there will be a square, and since the area is close to the sun, it is considered to be a good place to stay for passers-by.
The artwork will be illuminated and the material will now be able to enjoy itself better than before on these 142 square meters.
In the area there will also be small "fog sprayers", some kind of water sculptures, which offer play and give the area a certain amount of mystery.
In this way, the improvements are described by the City of Reykjavík, which is being implemented together with Veitur.
Water supply, heat supply and electrical supply will be renewed.
Many of these have come to their end, but the sewage and cold-water storage facilities date back to 1925 and have served the residents and businesses of the downtown area for almost a century.
When the street is reopened after completion, cars can drive around it again.
However, it becomes a one-way street and at the same time creates a quieter and more accessible space for pedestrians.
According to information about the Customs House on the website of the customs officer, the house was used in 1971, and its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Due to a port damage reaching through the house, 250 square meters of windowless wall surfaces formed into a street.
The building committee and architect agreed that such surfaces would adversely affect the overall streetscape, if special measures were not taken to adorn the appearance of the house.
So the parties agreed to calculate by having a permanent artwork installed there.
During this time, there was a lot of talk about Gerði Helgadóttir, an artist, says in the summary.
She had worked extensively on mosaic works in Germany and elsewhere.
The decision was to first contact her before deciding whether there would be a competition for the work.
It had often been discussed that the work needed to reflect life at the port, since the port had been a lifeblood of Reykjavík since it was made.
When talking to the artist, she became the lover of such a work.
It had to be agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before she would leave the country again, as she would work on the proposals abroad.
Gerður was given the time she herself decided she needed, and when she returned home, she made some suggestions for discussion.
It was agreed without delay to ask her to do the work.
At the same time, it was desired to make a complete agreement with her and the famous art company in Germany, the Brothers Oidtmann, but Gerður had long worked with them to the installation of famous works of art throughout Europe.
Contracts were concluded, and Gerður worked the artwork under the installation of their brothers' workshop, which then arranged for the installation of the Toll House.
The whole work was extremely well done, both by Gerðr Helgadóttir and the Oidtmann brothers, says in the summary.
Since then, the weather has been very cold in Iceland.
It took about two years to do the work, which was done and installed in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Toll House work was completed, only 47 years old.
Preparing for the transfer of more institutions to the country
Asmundur Einar Dadason, Minister of Social Affairs, announces that more public institutions will be moved out of the country in the near future.
This was stated by the Minister in the episode Explosives on the Wave at lunchtime.
It was recently announced that the Fire Department of Housing and Civil Engineering will be moved north to Sauárkrók this fall.
Six experts in the field of firefighting work at the agency, but none of them intend to follow the agency north and the National Association of Firefighters and Medical Transporters has criticized the livestock transport.
“I think we need to take another step in this direction.
I am preparing for another step in this process.
"Further transport," said Asmund.
He is convinced that the vast majority of the people want to see more distribution of public institutions around the country.
“I think it is necessary to make further political decisions about the transfer of public services to land, just as I did with the Housing and Civil Engineering Agency,” said Asmundur, but he also took examples from other institutions that have been transferred to land and were of great importance to communities abroad, such as the transfer of the Food Agency to Selfoss, Landsvirkjun.
All the best from the second day of the Championship
94. Iceland's freestyle championship ended at Þorsvellir in Akureyri today.
A number of tournament records were set on the second race day.
An exciting competition was expected in the women's sledge throw at Thorsvellir, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH set the Icelandic record in the sledge throw in 2014 which lasted until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from IR improved the record in May last year.
Vigdís won the Icelandic record earlier this summer and has been in fantasy form lately, but she has tripled the Icelandic record for the rest of the summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been struggling with injuries and did not recover today.
She had only one valid throw out of five, throwing 25.69 yards, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the longest of all today, or 60.08 meters in her last attempt, and at the same time set a tournament record.
Her Icelandic record she set earlier in July is 62.69 metres and so she was somewhat away from it.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from IR had the second best throw of the day, but she improved her best result with a throw of 50.18 metres.
In the men's group, FH-ing Hilmar Örn Jónsson, the Icelandic record holder in batting, won a safe victory, but he threw 73.84 meters in his next last throw and set a tournament record.
His Icelandic record in the article is 75.26 metres.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, Olympian and Icelandic record holder in the round trip, won a competition in the bulwark at Thorsvellir yesterday, but today he competed in the round trip, which is his main event.
Guðna Vals's Icelandic record is 65.53 metres, but he threw the longest 59.13 metres today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Foreignsson threw the second longest today, but he had one valid throw that worked in the 2nd place, 49.43 meters.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, the Iceland record holder in long jump, won the long jump competition with superiority, but Hafdís jumped the longest 6.25 meters today, which is almost 40 cm from her Iceland record.
In the women's 200-meter race, it was the Irishman Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir who was the fastest, but she finished in 24.04 seconds, while her Icelandic record in the article is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was victorious at Akureyri, but she won two gold medals yesterday, in the 100-meter race and in the 4 x 100-meter race and then also in the 4 x 400-meter race today.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH was the first to finish in the 200 metres race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Uliver Mána Samúelsson from Urmann.
Like Guðbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100 metres yesterday as well as in the 400 metres race.
Don't get a fine for a $27 million Bitcoin crop
An over-taxation committee has rejected the claim of a tax investigator who demanded a fine over a man for under-reporting his capital income that was due to the sale of the electronic currency Bitcoin.
The committee concludes that the tax investigator had not provided clear evidence as to why it was necessary to fine the man.
The committee's ruling states that the tax investigation director believed the man has evidence of materially incorrect tax returns due to the income years 2016 and 2017.
He would have understated his capital income that would have arisen from the sale of the 27 millionth Bitcoin, either intentionally or out of grand negligence.
Guilty to the man for his conduct.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
However, he agreed to have sold electric coins for 27 million in 2016.
She would have acquired it with a grave in 2009 and 2010 when such would have been both easy and unobstructed with a normal home computer.
Then he pointed out that when he sold the electric coins, the tax liability for such a sale had been significantly unclear and unforeseeable.
It could have been expected that the general public would be aware of such measures on tax returns.
He would not have intended to avoid paying taxes on the crop and would have accounted for his property on a forward as a deposit on a currency bill.
He would have inquired with both the know-how and the state treasurer as to how this was done but without success.
Then he thought it would be necessary to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started digging for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to study complex rules that the tax authorities would not have formed a clear view of.
The man correctly believed that his taxes for these two income years would be recalculated and pressures applied, but otherwise no punishment would be imposed.
He then reiterated that he works in Iceland and had paid taxes in Iceland since 2012.
He would never have intended to escape his responsibilities in an inappropriate manner.
The demand for a fine would be out of all proportion and would plunge him into debt.
He said: “This guy knows what football is.
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been considerably between the teeth of people but also impressed by his performance during the remainder of a season with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max division.
Flashes will be in the fire line tonight as they receive IA live broadcast on Station 2 Sport.
Brynjólfr then takes out a ban due to four reminders during the season and therefore does not show up for the game with a new haircut as in the summer's games so far.
He had had "blah, blah, blah" written on his head for the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won 1–0.
“I don’t know who exactly he was answering with the payment, but speaking of character, this one was better to try in the game.
He did not go into hiding.
He wants to get the ball every single time and if there was anyone going to equalize this game then I thought he would do it or make it," said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max stand, when deemed to be attacking Brynjolf.
“I’m here for the people.”
“Sometimes it’s hard to figure out where he is.
He looks a little out the left side when it starts to pass the games, but he has a very free roll in the team," said Hjörvar Haflíðason.
Thorkell Máni Pétursson says Brynjólf is a real entertainer and is delighted to have such a colourful man in the league: “No one disputes that this is a character.
This is a fun type and I love this with my hair, and to be always ready to attend and answer in interviews.
“There’s an incredible amount of people preoccupied with him, who tell me that this man understands what football is.
“I am an entertainer.
I want to be there for people and enjoy it.”
The people are reading the interviews with Brynjólf, people are paying themselves in and watching what is next on his hair.
“This man is a genius,” he said.
He said he wants to leave the club, “I’ve been in contact with a few teams in the B-team.
Tobias Thomsen, a player in the Pepsi Max division, appears to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to return home to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to get the start of the season in his home country, but for this he first has to cancel his contract at KR, where the Danish league starts before the Icelandic odds.
The company knows that I miss Denmark and has shown me a lot of understanding," Tobias said in a conversation with Bold.
“I’ve been in contact with a number of teams in the B-team and will probably switch before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay my contract at KR."
He said he is likely to have to take a pay cut in Denmark.
“Companies in Denmark have probably felt more about the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.”
Bjartmar has recovered a wheel for millions - now answers for himself after the coverage of DV
For over a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had an interest unlike most others.
He blows up and rescues lost and stolen bikes, electric bikes, and wasps.
Bjartmar has earned the name "the wheel whistler" as a result.
Yesterday, there was a great deal of excitement when you published an account of your relationship with Bjartmar.
They then referred to a discussion on the Facebook group Vesturbæringar, where it was stated that Bjartmar had spoken to the man in Austurvellir and said that the wasp may have been stolen.
There was nothing else to read from the original writings of the electric scooter but that Bjartmar had stolen it.
That text has now been changed on Facebook and the headline of DV's original news updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the original news of the case is not at all descriptive of what really happened yesterday in Austurvellir.
Bjartmar said he had received information from a victim of electrocution that these were indeed his own electrocutions.
This information was obtained from an alleged owner, but the information was found to be incorrect, says Bjartmar.
“I saw the guy and I recognized the shuttle, end with information that there was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and was being searched.
I hesitated at first, but when I saw him preparing to leave on the shuttle, I decided to punch the man.
The owner was certain of his fault and so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I do very well in such matters, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken the word off me."
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric scooter invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and called the police himself.
"Yes," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this straight."
Then the owner of the electric scooter proved ownership of his electric scooter and took off.
Later, the owner of the electric scooter told his story on Facebook, as reported in the previous story.
In this over a year that Bjartmar has been engaged in this practice, he says he can count the exchanges that he came up against people on the fingers of one hand.
“I have had peaceful relations with the most difficult people in Reykjavík,” said Bjartmar, pointing out that bike thieves are by far the least brothers and sisters in the community, addicts, mentally ill people and other people who are on the street for some reason.
“The drug is a hard master and somehow we have to finance the next dose, unfortunately, stealing from such loose capital is an easy way to achieve that goal,” says Bjartmar.
“My relationship with these people is really so good that I have a lot of the good people with me.
There are examples of people going to treatment and taking care of themselves and then coming to me and helping me with what I'm doing," he says.
In general, Brightmar's interactions with bikers are on a courteous note.
Some know about him and what he is doing and peacefully offer to show him receipts, bike numbers and so on.
Bicycle theft is a big problem that has been little discussed.
In addition, Bjartmar says that the police have even begun to point people to talk to him about stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar disagrees with the previous news broadcast DV and claims not to be some kind of self-proclaimed police in a personal search for justice.
Asked if he is still not on top of the ice with his act, and if this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar says certainly be.
"Of course, the police should do this, but the fact is that the police are simply not doing this.
I’ve watched police officers drive away from a pile of stolen wheels.
“She’s absolutely clueless in these matters.”
“When the police aren’t doing anything about it, and it’s just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this class of cases, why not?” asks Bjartmar.
He says he has had so much success in having on top of stolen wheels, that sometimes he bumps into his "clients" on the street that then they just have the right Brighter wheels they had previously recovered.
The times that Bjartmar has called for police assistance have seen that she simply does not show up.
"This is just not working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the owners of the bikes to blame," said Bjartmar and regrets that victims of bike theft have to suffer the emptiness of the police in this case.
The success of Bjartmar is not shared.
There are many stories of people thanking Bjartmari for bringing their possessions back to them.
Bjartmar himself says he has long lost the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts will of course run in the millions, if not millions.
There, electric scooters, electric bicycles and electric scooters weigh heavily, but electric bicycles can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works day to day at a kindergarten and every other weekend he works at a cohabitation.
So his bike chase is an unpaid job he does in his spare time.
Long Shadows and Long Shadows
2019 was a big year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Officials had indeed received pensions from the King of Denmark all the way from the 19th century, but in 1919 the Pension Fund of Officials was established, which eventually became the pension fund of all public employees.
The basis for the current pension funds of general wage earners was then laid by universal collective bargaining in the labour market in 1969, providing for a employment-related pension fund with compulsory membership and a full fund collection from the beginning of 1970.
Then, in 1974, laws were made on the basis of these treaties, and the pension system continued to strengthen thereafter.
The pension system of wage earners was not the only radical change brought about by the 20th century labor movement with its nuclear struggle.
Unemployment insurance had been similarly acquired in historic strike battles in 1955, and also the organization gradually progressed its claims to sickness rights and medical funds, substantial holiday entitlements, shortening of working hours, improvements in housing, and more such things as being of great importance.
All these rights cost a great and severe battle, but they proved, to be expected, much greater and more lasting benefits than the increase in the amount of money in the wage envelope, which disappeared as hard as the heat of the inflation that characterized the post-war period and up to 1990, as many remember.
The move to the establishment of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although people would eventually agree that the funds would in effect be the property of fund members, the labor movement had to agree that their boards should be appointed representatives of employers and fund members equally.
In the following years after the foundation of the funds, the demand for the majority of workers in the management of the funds was often discussed in the organizations of wage earners, but it never succeeded in doing so, and so we still find ourselves with the abnormal arrangement that representatives of fund members are not in the majority in the management of the funds.
Article 36 of Act No. 129/1997 on compulsory insurance for pension rights and the operation of pension funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.
It says in the first paragraph that "the pension fund shall have the interests of fund members as a guide."
Also, the fifth paragraph states: "The Life Insurance Fund shall set itself ethical standards in investment."
The shareholders' policy of the Pension Fund of traders includes the following provisions, in continuation of the aforementioned legal provisions:
The Pension Fund is a party to the United Nations (UN PRI) rules on responsible investment, along with many of the largest pension funds and professional investors in the Western Ocean and in Europe.
The rules discuss how focusing on environmental and social issues as well as good corporate governance practices can contribute to improving the investment performance of portfolios.
This brings together the interests of investors and the goals of society in a broader context.
LV believes it is important that companies, especially those listed on the stock market, adopt a public policy on: maintaining good governance of social responsibility and environmental issues.
The Pension Fund Value, which has the country's largest funds, has set itself a "policy of responsible investment" and there are provisions of a similar nature.
This is all recalled here as an introduction to the latest Icelandic fashion word, "shadow management".
Since the word is new in the case, it is not to be expected that it has been defined in full, but to me the following definition now seems to be "most taken": Shadow management is that when a leader in a trade union says in the media that he intends to send the company's representatives to the board of pension fund recommendations or instructions on how to take a stand on the matter.
If they do not comply with the recommendations, they will be removed from the board at the first convenience.
If the leader does not take this to the media and does not talk about resignation, however, it is not "shadow management" since such human relations are of course always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I leave the reader to ponder which path he finds "shadowier."
There are, in particular, two people who have tried to formulate this definition when this is written, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
They are Hörður Ogisson, journalist at Fréttablaðið, and Asgeir Jónsson, banker.
The reason for both was created after Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had announced his intention to terminate the company’s agreements with flight attendants and flight attendants (say them), and Ragnar Þor Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavík Chamber of Commerce, sent out the recommendation to representatives of the company in the Board of Directors of the Icelandic Chamber of Commerce that they should not support
Some time later, Bogi Nils retracted his decision, and as a result Ragnar Thor went the same way with his recommendations, which of course depended on Boga's decision.
Nevertheless, they saw a reason to discuss the matter in Friday’s newspaper with great words about shadow management, lawbreaking and a rich need for changes to the law.
There, small doves were indeed to be rolled heavy loads, even though the blessed dove had been in contact mode and, in addition, had been wiped out soon.
Since it’s important, let’s consider the topic itself at the end.
I’m going to go through some of the rules of the law that apply to this case.
This means that the fund management must safeguard the interests of the fund members and have ethical criteria in investments, and these points are elaborated in more detail in the approvals of both Validis and the Pension Fund of traders as I mentioned.
However, pension funds should NOT only look at short-term profitability considerations in their investments.
Such a policy would be very dangerous, and it would not be necessary to look for a long time for examples of this in the past, where large loans from banks and funds have flowed to immoral adventurers and environmentalists, with disastrous consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on high ice when he thought of wiping out a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the goodwill the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Fortunately, he got it and took it back.
Time will show whether it is sufficient for the investment of pension funds in the company to be considered responsible towards fund members when the situation arises.

One of the infected persons did not have a homecoming infection
One of the three who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Iceland yesterday came to the country from the Baltic Sea state on July 15, about a week and a half ago.
He is, however, an Icelander who is not resident here on a regular basis and was therefore not given clear instructions to conduct a so-called homecoming check after arriving in Iceland and going for another sampling a few days after arrival.
He received a negative from screening at the border.
“But he is in Icelandic society and really should go to that resort,” says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, an expert in the field of infectious diseases at Landsvækni and a substitute for an infectious disease doctor during his summer vacation, in a conversation with the newspaper today.
"He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the identification number and if the identification number is not registered then you are not automatically announced in the second sample."
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually living abroad, but because of his network of contacts in the country as an Icelander he should have rather used it Icelandic.
But he did not realize this.
“When you don’t have the ID number, you have to apply for it yourself in the second sample.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that it was the right way," says Kamilla.
“So it’s clear that we need to improve the information about this while we find some way to make an automated system even though Icelanders don’t register their ID numbers.
Or to make it somehow more obvious who are participants in Icelandic society in the registration system," she explains.
Fortunately, the person in question does not associate with the arrival in Iceland, even though he or she is defined as a participant in Icelandic society, a resident of Iceland.
Only six have been sent to the hospital after he was diagnosed yesterday, and these six were all in contact with him.
They are going to have a sampling, but two of them are beginning to show signs of Covid-19 infection.
The man received a negative from his sampling at the border on July 15.
Kamilla probably says that he was recently infected with the virus that she was not yet able to detect it when the sample was taken at the border.
She does not, however, want to rule out that the man was infected here in Iceland, but did not carry the virus with him to the country.
"It's not entirely possible to claim that this is definitely an imported infection because it's been a long time since he came to the country that he could have been exposed here like those two who have caused a bit of a stir at the sporting events."
She says it’s very unlikely because of how few people are around.
"It's really very unlikely," Kamilla says, but states that it can't be ruled out until Icelandic genetic analysis has sequenced the virus in the human.
“If we get a type of virus that hasn’t been seen here before, it’s almost certain that he brought it to the country.”
Pipes and bombs fired on protesters
There was a clash between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police used pepper spray and non-lethal grenades, but protesters broke windows and set fire.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racism were protested in many parts of the United States last night, but the Seattle protests were in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot dead.
As reported on the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered in peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to a building area and broke windows in the city's courthouse.
As a result, police said the protests were rioting and there was a conflict between groups of protesters and police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was murdered by police last August, was remembered by protesters.
A car drove through a group of protesters in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of National Guardsmen gathered and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was murdered by police in her home last March.
The group carried a firearm and joined forces at a closed intersection where police affiliated the group from a group of people protesting the protests and also carried a firearm.
Then there were 75 arrests in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters recalled James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was murdered by a white bar owner in May.
It’s not the game that defines our time.
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, manager of Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of the game at Leicester today in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United lose the game, and Chelsea do not lose against Wolves, Solskjaer and his men end up in 5th place, thereby losing the Champions League seat.
However, they should still hope to get into the Champions League by winning the European League next month.
“We’re not at the end.
If we get a point against Leicester I think people will say we haven't had a bad season now," said Solskjaer.
“But whatever happens, it’s not the end of our journey because we still have a lot of ground to catch up with the two teams above us,” Solskjaer said.
It is clear that people's nerves will be tense at 3 p.m. today, but Solskjaer tried to pretend that each other's game was involved.
“If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and the company is based on this.
We have created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it is ours to take advantage of it," said Solskjaer.
"It's not the most important game of the season, it's just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The result does not define our period, we have already had many hours to define this period."
“The arrival of Bruno Fernandes changed a lot for us and I think we are in a much better shape and a lot stronger mentally than we were last season,” Solskjaer said.
65,000 infections per day
65,490 new infections of the coronavirus were detected in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed in the western seas since the beginning of the epidemic in that country.
900 died from the virus yesterday, but in the last four days up to that point, deaths from the virus were more than 1,000 a day.
A total of 146,460 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to a CNN report, the number of deaths caused by the virus will be 175,000 on August 15.
Fear of the second wave of the epidemic
The government in Spain is now trying to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
No more have been detected in one day since early May, and the reports come at the same time as the Spanish begin to lift one of the strictest curfews in Europe.
The setback led to the British authorities now requiring passengers arriving from Spain to go on sick leave upon their return.
A week earlier, Spain was on the British list of safe states.
The situation is worst in Catalonia in the north-east of Spain, where the government has resorted to broader restrictions to try to stem the growth.
In the capital, Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and wave houses will be closed at midnight.
The ban is now in force for 200,000 people in Segria County in western Catalonia.
It is believed that the decision by the UK will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is poorly played after the outbreak.
Tui, the UK's largest travel agency, cancelled all flights scheduled today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the epidemic, but little interest seems to be in resorting back to an extensive curfew that has widely devastated the economy.
For example, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken a very bad view of this, and likened it to a nuclear weapon he does not want to use.
Jean Castex, France's prime minister, has said that the nation "would not survive, economically or socially," if a national curfew were to be reinstated.
Hope many councillors to the local resources that reach the inhabitants of individual towns, cities or areas will suffice to hold off the virus in the next round if it comes.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three domestic
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday as well as two more at the border.
This is how five people with positive COVID-19 infection were diagnosed yesterday in Iceland.
In a public health announcement, one infection is linked to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He has been sent into solitary confinement and sixteen who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
The infected person was a participant in the social work of a sports club in Reykjavík and according to the announcement, "only part of the sports team" is in quarantine.
Others who were sent to the asylum are connected to the man in a different way.
The origin of this contagion is undetected and a full-fledged contagion team of State Police officers.
The ReyCUP tournament organisers have followed the guidelines and rules of the medical and public health services that are still in force and have taken appropriate measures.
However, pictures of the tournament yesterday attracted attention as it was possible in a very close fellowship to celebrate the good fortune of his team out on the field.
Just before 11 a.m. today, the protesters posted the following announcement on their Facebook page.
It says “ATH: Parents please respect the rules that competitors pick up their own stuff at school.
Parents are not allowed to do that.
Thank you for your understanding.”
Another infection was diagnosed yesterday, but related to the infection reported the previous day.
“Icelandic genetic analysis has sequenced the infection and revealed a new type of virus that has not been detected here before.”
The infection is also treated in isolation and 12 in quarantine due to the infection.
The third infection in question is from a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, on July 15.
He was spotted on the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in solitary confinement and six who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
Two of them are already showing signs of viral contamination.
In addition, two people were identified at the border and are awaiting the results of further research such as a work-related infectious disease at the border.
Finally, the report states: The Department of State Police and the Office of the National Medical Officer urge people to take care and pay close attention to individual infectious disease prevention.
If there is the slightest doubt about the presence of the Covid-19 virus, the same person is asked to have a sample taken at the nearest clinic.
Patreksfjörður says the campsite is booked for a shopping weekend - Direct guests
The camp site at Patreksfjörður is fully booked this weekend, according to the announcement of Vesturbyggður.
Guests are encouraged to check out other accommodations.
Named Vesturbyggdð Bildudalur, Tálknafjörður, Melanes á Rauðasand, Hótel Flókalund and Hótel Breiðavík as other options in the position.
There is plenty to do at Patreksfjörður this weekend, as there will be Skjaldborg, a festival of Icelandic documentaries held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and therefore become a strong tradition in the town.
Of the application in the camping area to be judged can expect a good attendance this year, if the weather does not put a bar in the account, but DV said earlier today about the adverse forecast.
You can expect the worst weather in the south, however, and hope for Patreksfirðir.
The web bb.is first reported, and said that all other accommodations in the town were already fully booked.
Entire apartment building caves down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live free at Dunhaga 18-18.
Meanwhile, owners are seeking a building permit for renovation, but their errand has been successful in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, greenest and most expensive neighbourhoods in Reykjavík, there is a magnificent multi-storey building on three floors.
On the ground floor of the house there is about 600 square meters of commercial space.
Behind the house are the doors of two stairwells, each of which holds four fairly grand apartments.
They range from 93–130 square metres, though most are over 100.
The house has a lot of history to keep.
It was built in 1959 and has included a video rental, Skóstofan, Mjólkursamsallen milk shop, Jóa gunsmith, fish shop and most recently a University print.
The house, to put it mildly, has remembered its fool more beautiful.
The house is now under heavy damage, as can be seen in the accompanying photos.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf. are, according to the company register, among others Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús went for Borgun's ownership group and was a defender of Borgun's holding company.
In the group of owners of the holding company Borgunur is Stálskip ehf.
Stálskip ehf. is the investment company of Gudrun Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrún is also the owner of a third of the shares in D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, August Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once operated a steel ship.
D18 bought the house in the summer of 2009 and so little has been kept since then.
Neighbors say the condition of the house has deteriorated steadily since, though mostly in recent years.
On the neighborhood's Facebook page, one resident says that the house "wasn't very lively in recent years".
It may be that the owners have been looking for a few years to change the house and the plot.
Other neighbors say the house has not been okay for a long time.
"It's a long time to do something nice with this stain and it's sad that it's dragged on like this."
At the same time, he says that he is disgusted with the owners of the house for not having dared to finish this, found some common ground with the neighbors of the house and quit this "legal stick".
“Just do this in consultation with the community around you so you can get on with it and finish it.”
The "legal step" that the resident refers to is the planning process of the field that has been in progress at least since 2017.
Then the owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 relied on permission to build a floor on top of the existing multi-storey house and behind the house, a new elevator house and an annex on one floor as well as a basement.
The building permit granted for that implementation was appealed to the Committee on the Environment and Resources, and the committee dropped it as the implementation was not supported by a dispute resolution and a lay presentation was not satisfactory.
The City of Reykjavík then started with a piece of organizational work and finished it with an advertisement in the Government News last July.
That organization was also sued and the committee dropped it in March 2020.
At this point, therefore, nearly three years had passed since the original application for a building permit and the owners of the house were on the starting ground.
During this time, the house had suffered a significant downturn and neighbors were getting tired.
When the DV asked the neighbors of the house out to the situation and the neighbor's response was the answers in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the intentions of the owners of the house, others did not at all.
Others were angry at the city, others were not.
Others were just angry, but nothing at all.
Still others said the parking dispute apple, but neighbors have used Dunhaga's unused parking 18" under their vehicles.
A man in the room said he was tired of the process:
“The fact that we have to go through the process three times is absolutely incredible.
It's like the City of Reykjavík couldn't read."
Today, the house is empty, abandoned, and neglected.
A monument to the city's ephemeral administration and the noble intentions of the owner and the many years of their work that are now in an initial slot.
When a journalist parked at Dunhaga 18, a galloping door and debris pile opened.
A Playstation computer and a recent TV contained another piece of trash on the ground – the victims of an Icelandic summer soak.
It was opened in the old office of the University Press and there a lot of cats of the smell of sheep to judge.
It is clear that someone has laughed at one corner, but no one is visible.
Characters of couches and beds and a few boards of geological pages, which were no doubt to become a book, batted.
The stairs of the apartment building were also open and life in them both.
A journalist was lucky enough to encounter one of their residents.
There the Romanians cooked a potato dish for dinner and invited a journalist in.
The Romanians work for the staff hire Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and copy the sources of DV that the company has paid nothing for the premises except heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house is not considered defensible to collect rent.
From the reasons of the mail in the lobby of the house to judge, it is clear that there have been a lot of foreign workers in the last few misses.
The operation of employee leasing has not been affected by the Covid-19 situation, as a contraction in tourism has led to a contraction in the construction sector, and these two industries have been the most efficient to take advantage of employee leasing services.
Nevertheless, the homeowners of Dunhaga 18 seemed to have plenty to do and hung the work wickets and wickets in the community to dry after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the miserable condition of the house, the apartment shared by the boys seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist said goodbye to the Romanian boys, his irony suddenly became clear: In the best place in Reykjavík, 1,500 square meters of real estate stands dilapidated.
Owners want to change the house to improved and neighbors want to improve the situation but dispute the definition of "improved".
In between, the city's planning area sits on the starting ground, the victim of endless appeals and due diligence in the planning process and the phased resolution of the Committee on the Environment and Resources.
In the house are so Romanian workers, perhaps precisely those who are going to improve the situation, when the Icelanders stop fighting.
The article originally appeared in DV's weekend paper on July 17.
In the fight against obesity following a coronavirus pandemic
Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson will provide ?10 million in a campaign against obesity, which will include a ban on fast food advertisements, following his serious illness, in part due to his weight.
Johnson is expected to introduce the campaign, which has been called Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe cycling for their clients in excess and will also be attacked in an effort to increase cycling paths.
TV ads will be banned by 9 p.m., according to British media reports.
"COVID-19 has alerted us to the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use the time to become healthier, more active and eat healthier foods," a government spokesman said.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was hospitalized when he contracted the coronavirus in the spring, and it is partly his weight due to which he is thought to have become so seriously ill.
Women are better at making the changes.
She said the new constitution was the biggest step the nation can take toward greater power distribution, transparency, and in countering corruption and the interests of the whole.
“We need to change gears a little bit now, and who better to lead that change than the group of people who find it easier to live in these values.
There are women," said Helga.
“Women in Iceland are famous for their women’s solidarity.
Staying together and making changes.
Now it’s time for us to make these changes.”
She said she was a little uneasy about the focus on Iceland as "the best in the world" in both gender equality and human rights.
“We’re not ready to see what needs to be done.
As Germans are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
That's a lot.
We need to know where we are coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of marginalized groups.
We don't all live by the same rules here," said Helga.
When asked, she said that women are in many ways good things in Iceland, but added that, like in many other places, Icelanders are based on very masculine values.
She said that politics turned to form about their own interests, authority, and power which were the forces that maintained inequality in all societies.
"Women have now formed this group and come together and are just getting a little annoyed that the Assembly is going to move forward to look past this 2012 referendum," she said.
“That’s the kind of woman we’re thinking about.
From human rights and nature conservation, cooperation and that we all really sit at the same table," she said, adding that the former values were the basic values of the new constitution.
“We are a very rich country of natural resources and it is ridiculous that there are people living in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can change differently," said Helga.
“It’s ridiculous that there’s a natural law that women’s jobs are always lower paid.
It’s ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses have to fight endlessly just to get a decent salary.”

Trying to rob a pedestrian in the city center
A man was arrested in downtown last night after he threatened pedestrians and tried to get money from him.
Police also stopped the production of drugs in Årbær, where two were arrested for the case.
Then the police stopped the driver of a motorcycle in the Hills, where its driver was at a speed of 146 km, with a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of driving privileges.
The police in the capital area had enough to turn in the night and there were over 80 cases recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
There was a lot of noise because of it.
On Saturday night, there were reports of eleven noisy gatherings and it seemed much in the diary of the police.
Last night, there were 22 police officers on board.
Six people were in jail last night.
In the town, police were called in at night when parties fired fireworks into the air.
However, they had escaped when police officers carried to the yard.
At that time, nine drivers were stopped for intoxication and or drug driving.
Four people were arrested for fighting in the city centre last night, but one of them was saved in a prison cell.
Then two were taken to an emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in the city centre and the other in the West Town.
One was taken to an accident department after he was injured jumping on a trampoline in Kopavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver who pulled a trailer on Kjalarnes yesterday.
The trailer's bicycle equipment was, according to a police diary, in a "very bad condition" and it was stationary.
You can stay in Monet's house during the Merchant Weekend
The house in which impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his practice is now available for rent on the Airbnb website.
The next available night in the house is the shopper's weekend.
The house is small and quaint, located in the town of Givenry, Normandy, France.
The painter world famous lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two lounges and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If someone is planning to rent the house, they must rent at least two nights.
Based on Airbnb's page, it is next available after a week, on Sunday of the shopper's weekend, and so it might be ideal for some shoppers on holiday to hurry to book the painter's house.
The two nights over a commercial weekend cost no more than USD 964 or just over ISK 130,000 as the Newspaper gets next.
Dozens of people are infected and some of them have started to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five have been diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically in the last three days, and most of the infected are unrelated.
Tens of thousands of people have become infected because of this, and some of them have begun to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically yesterday and two at border screening.
An expert in the National Medical Service says that a growing number of domestic infections do not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading far and wide in society.
“It has been serialized from the previous domestic infection and there is a virus that has not been seen here before so we have no particular reason to believe that it has gone viral in the community for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very careful now," said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, an expert in the field of infectious diseases in the National Medical Service.
Most of the infected people have been associated with individuals who came from abroad.
Further sampling takes place at a later date than some who were in contact with the infected have begun to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
"Now there is no influenza going on and less of other respiratory infections so we can be quite liberal with it doing these tests on individuals who in influenza time would have found a reason to do something else first," said Kamilla.
The infection is mostly complete, but it is not impossible that more people need to go into quarantine.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending a sporting event.
This raises the question of whether such an event is justified.
Public Safety Commissioners say it well as long as people follow standards and rules.
Kamilla says it is almost impossible for the infected to be infected at the sporting events.
“If there is no more isolation from these individuals after interacting with them at these sports events, we can claim that our infection prevention at the tournaments has worked.
But that has not been revealed," said Kamilla.
The work of the Department of Public Defence is under constant review.
"We need to be prepared to intervene with further advice or restrictions if it seems appropriate," Kamilla said.
In less than a week, the number of seats will be reduced to a thousand.
This new location could affect the layoffs.
"Certainly a thought to cook" - See Elisha Wood's menu
Elísa Vidarsdóttir is an accomplished soccer player and plays with Val.
She is also a master's student in nutrition, mother, and serves as a food scientist.
It requires a lot of energy for the feeding of the day and usually gives itself time to cook good and nutritious food.
My normal day starts with being at work from eight,” says Elisa.
“After work, I go to the store to prepare dinner before I bring my girl to the nursery at about 3:00 p.m.
Elisa finds it very nurturing to pick up her daughter early in kindergarten.
“It’s good to have time with her before I go to practice the second part.
After the workout, it’s good to come home and just have to warm up your food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one episode to empty the mind."
Elisa does not follow any particular diet.
She is finishing her master’s thesis in nutrition, so she knows what is right for her to eat in order to have enough energy to do her work, school, family and exercise.
“What suits me is to eat a variety of foods that are well-composed of proteins, carbohydrates and fats.
However, I think the most important thing is to have a healthy relationship with food and not to classify food into bad or good, rather nutritious or nutritionally deficient.
It’s okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not always.”
Elisa is very interested in cooking.
“I like to think about cooking in the kitchen, so I do a lot of it.
I have to say that confidence is with me in the kitchen and I truly believe that I am a good cook."
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, leave in almond milk overnight.
Eat this meal with whatever you have.
Most often it is banana and crispy muslim & coffee.
I am a great coffee drinker.
Spacing: Incredibly different, but fruits or vegetables, flat cakes, clean skyr with bananas and muslims, bread with indulgences and then I could eat hummus with a spoon out of a box if that's the case.
Lunch: I often make all kinds of tasty salads from what is available in the fridge, quinoa or barley, falafel buns, rock salad, oven-baked vegetables with a good dressing is something I am working on.
If the organization goes completely out of bounds (which happens often) then the egg machine at work has come to my rescue quite often and then there are 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and boiled eggs, put no more on you.
Intermediate: Give me something high in carbohydrates for exercise, bread with rinds, cereal or fruit.
Dinner: Fish will be very often for the choice of my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Conflict between police and protesters in Seattle
City authorities in Seattle, Washington, have declared a state of revolt following a mass protest in the city centre.
Police yesterday resorted to flare bombs and pepper spray to try to clear a large area occupied by protesters and stretched over many blocks in the vicinity of the city's parliament building.
Police announced on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was over at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
City and police authorities say that protesters stoned police with rocks, bottles, whistle bombs and other loose explosives and one police officer was taken to a hospital where his injuries were done.
The protests in Seattle, however, were peaceful for a long time.
A blow was made to them to show solidarity to protesters in Portland, Oregon, but in that city there has repeatedly been a fierce conflict between protesters and heavily armed forces of federal police officers.
There, as in more cities in the United States, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, recalls Georges Floyds, who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, protesting systemic racism in American society and demanding redress.
Not withdrawn until after the vote
It remains to be seen whether the cancellations of Icelandair’s flight attendants, which are due to take effect at the next month’s meeting, will be revoked.
The electronic vote on the collective agreement between the Icelandic Air Carriers on behalf of Icelandair will end at noon tomorrow.
Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, chairman of the company, says that Icelandair will not take a decision on the resignations until the result of the vote.
“It’s all very well,” said Guðlaug Líney.
“There have been no cancellations, this has to be done so that the machines can be manned.
It’s hard to tell if you’ll have a job in the next few months.”
The contract was signed a week ago, on the night of July 19.
It is expected to remain in effect until the end of September 2025 and is based on a deal that flight attendants had previously voted on.
On 17 July, the Board of Directors and the Board of Trustees of the Icelandic Aviation Association agreed to announce an all-round work stoppage at Icelandair.
It never came, but this was decided following Icelandair's decision to cease negotiations with the Carrier Company, terminate all of its Carriers and seek agreements with another union.
Then the company's pilots were to take on the duties of security personnel on board temporarily.
Asking how she thinks the vote will go, Guðlaug says that it is difficult to say anything about it.
“People are hurt by this move by Icelandair, when all of the airline’s flight attendants were terminated and notified that a contract would be signed with another union.
Now it becomes clear if it has an effect," she says.
At the end of April, 940 flight attendants were employed by Icelandair, with 900 of them, about 95%, being terminated.
Their notice period is varied, with the shortest working life being three months and ending at the end of the month of July-August.
That’s more than 90% of Icelandair’s passengers.
What happens if the contract is not approved?
“We are looking forward to continuing discussions with our clients.
With this agreement, we are meeting the requirements of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the flight attendants have gone too far."
A vote on a collective bargaining agreement ends and Icelandair announces the second quarter results tomorrow
The flight attendant's vote on a new collective bargaining agreement ends at noon tomorrow.
Icelandair’s settlement for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary business results indicate that the company’s revenue has fallen by 85 percent from the same period last year.
Electronic voting on the collective bargaining agreement between the Icelandic Air Transport Association and the Confederation of Icelandic Industries for Icelandair began on Wednesday, 22 July, and ends tomorrow, Monday 27 July, at 12 noon.
Those entitled to vote on the agreement are Icelandair employees who pay social security contributions to the Carrier Company.
Icelandair and FFI signed a new collective bargaining agreement on Sunday 19 July, but on Friday, Icelandair had suspended talks with the company after flight attendants cancelled the previous agreement in a vote in early July.
At that time, Icelandair had informed all of the airline’s staff and crew on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new collective agreement was signed.
According to a new collective agreement, flight attendants must fly five more hours a month for the same basic salary.
The agreement will remain in force until 2025, when the provisions on how long to fly on one shift have been integrated.
The deal was presented to FFI members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday, and described many flight attendants who were discussed by a news agency with them over dissatisfaction over the deal.
However, most seemed to agree that it would have to agree to the agreement in order to keep the FFI alive.
Icelandair’s settlement for the second quarter will be presented tomorrow, but EBIT, its operating income for capital and taxes, is negative according to preliminary business results for USD 100 to 110 million, or about ISK 15 billion.
Icelandair sent the Stock Exchange preliminary calculations last Wednesday, which said that the company’s revenue amounted to about $60 million in the quarter or about ISK 8.3 billion.
Cash and cash equivalents amounted to about US$154 million at the end of the quarter, around US$21 billion.
Icelandair also plans to offer the company’s share capital in August.
Icelandair plans to conclude agreements with fifteen creditors, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer by the end of the month before a share issue.
A new variant rather than a new type of virus
“A new virus just means that it has been a person who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been going on in Iceland," says Már Kristjánsson, chief physician at the National Hospital's infectious disease department, about the news that "a new type of virus" has been detected in Iceland.
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One who was diagnosed had participated in the social activities of a sports club at the Rey Cup football tournament, but the origin of the infection remains undetected and contagious.
An infection was also detected in a person who arrived in the country on 15 July and there are two people who were in contact with him began to show symptoms of COVID-19.
Then, yesterday, an infection related to an infection reported the previous day was detected, and after sequencing by Icelandic genetic analysis, a "new type of virus that has not been detected here before."
Contagion is completed in conjunction with that infection.
Már states that this is not a new virus but is the same virus that has spread around the world, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more correct to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asked what it meant and whether it could say anything about another wave of epidemics being started, Már says that as it is a single case, and it could go so that nothing more will come of it.
"However, if there are going to be cases in the country that do not have a connection from abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant then you could draw that conclusion [about the second wave] but it is premature to so support," explains Már.
Good luck in the hot tub
Is the secret to the happiness of Icelanders hidden in the hot tubs?
BBC programmers lead the way in a fun video that sheds light on the country's swimming pool and hot tub culture.
The Icelandic bathing culture is unique in the world and it is claimed that nowhere in the world are there as many bathing places per inhabitant.
The natural geothermal energy is its basis, but also the tradition of swimming that prevails here.
Children's swimming lessons were legalized in 1940, but older citizens are no less able to make use of the hot water for their own health.
Swimming trips are described as a permanent part of the country's general welfare.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class and position.
Ready for the mobile phones, people discuss personal notes about home and space or enjoy the soothing power of water: meditating and charging the batteries of the soul and body.
I want to spend a hundred days in the polls.
There are hundreds of days until the U.S. takes office and elects a president for four years.
Donald Trump is looking for re-election, but he has to go.
Joe Biden, the Democratic Party's future candidate, has a big advantage over Trump nationally, centering on the polls.
According to a recent AP news agency survey, a record number of Americans believe that the nation is on the wrong track.
Trump’s reaction to the new coronavirus pandemic is also very unpopular, and in addition, more Americans than ever consider the president to have disliked economic issues.
Only two out of ten Americans say the United States is on the right track.
Thirty-two percent say they support Trump's response to the epidemic, and 48 percent say he has kept a good eye on the economy.
In March it was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the average FiveThirtyEight, Biden follows 49.9 percent nationally, while Trump follows 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to shift attention away from his performance towards the epidemic to Biden, promoting so-called cultural disputes and proclaiming policies that should turn to law and order.
Biden’s campaign, however, is putting a lot of effort into keeping Trump’s attention focused and believes there is a high chance of winning if the election is really about how Trump has performed in the last four years.
Trump's unpopularity also appears to be coming down on the Republican Party's members, fearing the Progressives might even reach a majority in the U.S. Senate, which so far has been a very successful one.
Politico reported in the days to remain following parties and a candidate comparable, and it is now that the Republican Party would receive its biggest blow in decades.
The party has been particularly bad in the 2016 parliamentary elections, and now it looks like that trend will continue.
Trump has in recent days tried to intimidate suburban residents into following him, including saying that if President Biden becomes president, he will destroy the U.S. suburbs and promote racial strife.
Among other things, Trump has dropped a regulation since the time of Barack Obama in the White House designed to increase diversity in the suburbs.
Then he urged the "housewives" of the U.S. suburbs to read an article by the former Deputy Governor of New York, arguing that Biden would destroy the U.S. suburbs and accept Trump.
"Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and your American dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it even better!" the president said.
The population of the suburbs of the United States is an ever-expanding group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of this group's votes has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received a majority of votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Polls have shown that despite Trump securing a narrow majority in the 2016 suburbs, his follow-up there has significantly faltered.
Although there are differences between the polls, Biden has recommended about a fifteen percent lead on Trump in the recent exits.
Regis Philbin has died.
American television personality Regis Philbin has died at the age of 88.

According to Guinness World Records, Philbin is the person who has spent the most hours on American television and he has received recognition for that material.
He received six Emmy Awards on a career basis and was overall nominated 37 times.
A statement from his family states that Philbin died of natural disasters.
A number of colleagues, friends and fans have mentioned him on social media in the last 24 hours.
Will the Olympic flame be the light at the end of the corridors?
After a final decision had been made to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that only world wars have provoked up to now, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic flame of fame would be "the light at the end of the corridors," citing the expected pandemic of coronavirus that the world is now stepping through together.
Successful people have another year to prepare, and authorities in Japan are making up for the costs of the delay.
Everyone keeps their heads up a lot.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the site of the Olympics this year, the cheers of the Japanese representatives were genuine.
They wept and laughed alternately, as Tokyo had applied to hold the 2016 Games but turned it over to the lower tier for Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan were to bathe in the attention of the world.
The games were scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August but have been postponed for a year, starting instead on 23 July 2021 and ending on 8 August.
If the games fail to hold then, if the coronavirus becomes still too great a threat, the games will be canceled.
No one wants to think that way until the end.
The Olympic Games are no ordinary sporting competition.
Nothing is spared, the show should always be magnificent and strive to top the last play.
The choice of city for the Olympics is based on the evaluation of the selection committee on the city's presentations.
The bigger the presentation, the more likely it is to be won.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to hold the 2016 Olympic Games or amounting to just over $20 billion.
The second time, when the 2020 Games were applied for, $75 million, about $10 billion, was put into the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would receive the games this year, Japanese authorities had already spent $30 billion on the project.
However, that amount is just a drop in the ocean compared to the cost of building an Olympic village, stadiums and, in general, strengthening the country's infrastructure to manage such a tournament, prepare it and hold the games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been running these days but has been postponed for about a year due to the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report by a state auditor in Japan released at the end of last year found that the cost was almost double that figure.
It will probably not be possible to fully estimate the cost of postponing the games, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six billion dollars in additional initial costs.
The total cost to the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run between $15 and $30 billion.
The figures are so high that all the tax revenues of the Icelandic state were only worth about half of the Olympic Games, based on the lowest possible costs.
Olympic Games are events of such magnitude that they have tended to become the topic of discussion by economists, who try to scrutinize numbers and examine the benefits and benefits of the games.
In the shortest terms, it seems that many have concluded that the impact of the Olympics is less than so positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.
Short-term effects are some, for example, the number of jobs is very high in the short term, but in the long term cities tend to sit up with debt and high operating costs of small used structures.
Rio in Brazil is sitting up with significant debts due to the 2016 Games and has been having trouble paying for maintenance on all the major sports facilities built for the Games.
Figures have been released after the 2012 London Games, where it has been found that only 10 percent of those who got employment related to the Olympic Games in the city were previously unemployed.
This means that we are not talking about new jobs except in a small way.
In general, cities have not come out particularly well financially to hold Olympics because of the slick costs that accompany the structures built for the Games.
However, the benefits tend to be seen as an increase in the number of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities following the Games, though there is much uncertainty regarding the 2021 Games.
It is also uncertain whether all the number of spectators who usually attend the games will be accepted.
The main issue, however, is the credit that the cities get for being elected, but it is difficult to appraise for money.
Because despite the enormous costs, it can also be said that the joy that the games bring is not such that it can be put on a price tag.
But while it’s a great show, it’s not just about money.
It's the sports heroes who are in the foreground.
For some people, it’s just a matter of delaying the game.
For example, Australian five-year-old and gold medalist Chloe Esposito, in her article on the site of the Olympic Games, is a casolic and would have been far from a good joke this summer, but raises hopes of being in a competitive form for the 2021 Games.
She is therefore among those athletes who are just rather pleased with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who intended to retire after the Games this year, if they had been held on time, the suspension of the Games in some cases means that they will retire from competition before the Games take place.
Their bodies simply do not need to go through years of rigorous workouts.
Few athletes placed themselves as thoroughly in the hearts of spectators at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games as gymnast Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has appeared in several interviews in his home country of the United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She is planning to play in 2021, but she is not sure if she will still be at the top of the games next year, as she will then be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is at a higher level for a top-ranked gymnast.
“This is a sensitive issue,” Biles says, but smiles out in another interview published on the Olympic Committee’s Instagram page asking if she plans to reach the 2021 Games as much as she did in Rio 2016.
“I don’t know if I’ll still be at the top in another year of practice,” says Biles.
She has previously said that her body does not tolerate the stress that comes with physical education much longer.
Nevertheless, she is eagerly rehearsing for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to suddenly stop exercising when the pandemic was at its peak and the gymnasium was closed.
There were no exceptions for Biles any more than others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olympic gold could not buy any access beyond the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.
The basic form is certainly a bit better than that of most people.
“We have a plan now.
It was hard to start practicing again after the gym opened.
We started slowly, but we are in full swing again, and I will continue to increase with the exercises as the year goes on.
Of course, we don’t know exactly what these games will be or whether they will be held, but we still practice considering that they will be, can’t do otherwise.
I’ve put too much effort into leaving the sport now,” says Biles.
With it, like other blind doubt or perhaps more awareness that the situation may arise that the games will not be held at all in 2021 either.
To think about it is hopeless.
No one can know what the status of the coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympics given that they will be held in a year.
Perhaps the Olympic flame will be the light at the end of the Covid passages.
A Wedding Due to an Epidemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was scheduled to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are other more important things to think about right now," the actress said in a conversation with People.
“We want to get married at some point and have the dream wedding and have everyone present who is dear to us.
But we decided to put it on hold and focus on what is important right now and that is to help share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I’m more interested in weddings than weddings these days.
There’s a lot going on and we should focus our attention on what’s happening in the world.”
