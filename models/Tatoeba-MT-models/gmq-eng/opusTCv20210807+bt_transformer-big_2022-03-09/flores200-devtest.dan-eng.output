This not only confirms that there were at least some dinosaurs that had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as the color and the three-dimensional arrangement.
. Scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut brown at the top with a light or carrot-colored underside.
The findings also provide insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a feather shaft, but have other characteristics from feathers - rays and bee rays - the researchers deduced that the feather shaft was probably a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
Removed structure suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for decoration. The researchers believed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult plumage and not a chicken's down.
The researchers believe that the sample from the tail of the young dinosaur shows an adult individual's plumage and not a chicken's down.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate observations of the SagDEG galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be the result of tidal-like forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth and causes tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the galaxy SagDEG.
The researchers could conclude that the dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most dark matter around a galaxy is found around the galaxy in a kind of ring and consists of lots of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very worrying and that there was cause for alarm because of its very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two were hospital health professionals.

In Franking, voting has traditionally been low-tech: voters isolate themselves in a box and put a pre-printed piece of paper, which indicates their choice of candidate, in an envelope.
Once officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The procedure is codified very precisely in French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been transparent so that voters and observers can see that the ballot boxes do not contain ballot papers at the start of the vote and that no ballot papers are added other than those that are correctly counted and come from approved voters.
Candidates can send representatives as witnesses to all parts of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision and following specific procedures.

In her second race, which was a giant slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a total running time of 4:41.30. 2:11.60 minutes slower than the woman in first place, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished in ninth place.
Four skiers in the women's seated group did not complete the race, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in giant slalom did not rank in the race.
Police in Madhya Pradesh found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and we have found her mobile phone and laptop".
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants met in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
The driver suffered serious injuries to his head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with murdering his son.
She is in custody and waiting to be charged and brought to trial, but evidence from eyewitnesses may be flawed because her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish courts operate differently and the courts have considered the publication of images as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee comments that "it certainly seems that journalists should beware if they publish photos of suspects and the like."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made, at least until the indictment is available.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border conflict that Palestine wants based on the borders of before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics covered reportedly include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, as well as the problems surrounding the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a constant military presence in the valley for ten years, once an agreement has been signed, while the Palestinian authorities only agree to leave the valley for five years.
Shooters in the supplementary pest control trial were to be closely followed by the park rangers as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of nature conservation and heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instruction.
A new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) was sworn in yesterday by Martelly.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the resignation of the former CEP was recommended by a presidential commission as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests, which began in October, was the commission.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had not been held since 2011.
In about 60 reported cases, defective iPods have been overheated, causing a total of six fires and causing four people minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been aware of 27 accidents involving the units.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of another 34 cases of overheating, which the company called "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "quite regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Office announced that no injuries had been reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed as dead so far.
Six hostages including children and the elderly were released early and so were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady when she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He took an education as an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began researching early births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would speed up the development of the baby’s lungs in the fetal stage.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Quite unique, like herself. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as wild as me... maybe even more... loves her and is going to miss her... hopefully she's in a better place now."
Out of 1,400 people polled prior to the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 percent since 2008.
Constituent Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the various extremes of the vote, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was to swim in the style of 100 m and 200 m free and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints there have been doubts about his condition.
He could not take the medication necessary to fight his pain, as these are forbidden during the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed this discovery in early February using various hardware and software, and on Tuesday it was announced.
Comets may have been a source of water on Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and in particular how Earth was formed since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier in the year and last month signed a bill that legalized same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political sneer and folly".
I wonder if he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel per year and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older technology based on ground-based radars, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is put in and the trains above ground will not stop in Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride opportunities will not be available on the ground.
The fear of lack of transport raised the possibility that one would be forced to play the match behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos lakes.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species was developed in just two generations, although it had been thought that this process should have taken much longer due to mating between the endemic Darwin fin geospiza fortis and the invasive cactus fin geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be pulled out to a thin cable, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into plates.
It can be made very thinly and put on other metal. It can be made so thinly that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books, which were called "enlightened manuscripts".
This is called a chemical's pH value. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color, depending on how acidic or alkaline (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH value is given by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogens are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Shake the two dry powders together, then press them together into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewer system in almost every house,
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women stayed together in mixed company.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
To put a satellite or a telescope into space requires a giant rocket that is over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing that the wheel has done for us is that it has given us much easier and faster transport methods.
It has given us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below them are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose domestic cats) that eat the much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is a concept of the niche, a special task each cat has that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called herds.
The herds consist of one to three related adult males as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related to each other and are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds react much like wolves or dogs in herds, animals which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete who can climb (though not well), swim, jump far and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the loud roar of a lion, but sounds more like a phrase of snarling, shouting words.
Ozelotter prefers small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they have the opportunity. Almost all the animals that the ozelotte hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ozelots follow and find animals to eat (swap) via smells, by sniffing their way to where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move around very quietly. Ozelotter chases their prey by walking in one with their surroundings and then pounces on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) are separated from the main population they came from (as if they are moving across a mountain range or a river, or if they are moving to a new island so that they cannot easily move back), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs to have different features or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than had previously been needed.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Species are an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that humans inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the top of the food chain in its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set at the top of its mouth, meaning there was no escape route for anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue; its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that came in the water, and even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex would have nothing to do with it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans ate some strange or unusual things, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a sleeper.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have large feasts together, where they lay on their side while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a primary temple, which was considered the home of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary, into which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers, so-called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The Hebrew family lived most of their lives outdoors.
Women cooked the food in the courtyard; the shops were just open counters facing the street. Stones were used to build houses with.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was settled with few people. In the Nordic sagas it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Inuit tribes already lived in the area at the time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true; even though something is written on the back of the document, it is not a tax card.
Written on the reverse of the American Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document when turned upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its lifetime the large parchment document (it measures 293 x 4 inches x 241 x 2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So it is likely that the note was simply attached as an addition.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the southern part was still not free.
It was ruled by the French Vichy government - there are French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allied troops invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and were focusing on Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a larger, significant group of people living together and cooperating, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state; and it also somehow defines the size of society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A culture of civilization involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, long-term cultural influence, as well as fair dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, and are not recognized as real civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government – with Congress as the sole component – under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, they relied on the state authorities, who were often not cooperative in enforcing all actions.
It also had no right to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all the states before they could be changed, and the states took on the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and became FIFA World Champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "island group"
Taiwan's history begins back in the 15th century, when European sailors on their way past the island named it Ilha Formosa or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan that started a change in the original grain production practices, and hired Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) troops take control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and in 1885 declare Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, ruling over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been re-established, and excavations continue to this day.
For example, the most common photography format in the world for still images is 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, which can seem confusing, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio for this format is therefore 3:2 (divided by twelve to obtain the most simple integer ratio).
Many common formats (such as the APS formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The much-abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while keeping some order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and influential, was examined.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion bound European countries together despite different languages and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from king to ordinary citizens.
One of the most important Christian dogmas is that prosperity should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial means are used specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this dogma was properly lived up to.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, Britain launched a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective and prevented important military and civilian supplies from reaching its destination. This blockade was in violation of the recognized international laws codified in several international agreements over the last two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, which was a danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the country's unlimited submarine war.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations' attitudes leaned toward pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents on him, a collection of poems and a written recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different time periods were shown in a unique way; each Chinese time period or each family in power was a separate dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The best known of these periods was the era of three kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between Han and Jin dynasty.
During these periods there was a fierce war between many noblemen who fought for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China's history. Thousands of people died in the struggle to sit in the highest seat of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people, and not one ruler.
Even after the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to do well.
The same applies to the military, because instead of class-based ranking in the army, the ranking was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people from other countries to start their own internal revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the mundane life. He used to visit a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) to immerse himself in his thoughts.
The cave itself, which has survived through time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find at all, even if you know that it exists. When you are inside the cave, it is a total isolation.
Only the clear beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of the outside world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. and is one of many great pyramid structures built in honor of the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (of which the world-famous Great Pyramid is the largest of them all), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up-arch" mark resembles a V and the "down-arch mark" resembles a staple, or a square that lacks its lower side.
Up means you have to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Upstreaks usually produce a softer sound, while downstreaks sound stronger and more powerful.
You can always insert your own markings, but remember that the inscribed arch markings are determined for musical reasons, which is why they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Mrs. Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a crowd of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a screaming group of people shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage fully open.
At one point, a member of the mafia displayed the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles to the frightened queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
The Philippines had to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial power to raise money for the bulk of the expenses, and bond yields ran through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the government.
Of course, the superprofits of the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one needs to understand the context underlying the foundation of the Order.
The period in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the part of Europe's history that took place in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, which was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice from technology as a driving force or technological necessity, to a narrow idea that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic that relates to scientific laws, as well as the way they translate into technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a route largely outside cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has an "influence" on societies that are hereditary and not socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the motorized car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
But a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
When many people own cars, more accidents also happen on the roads, leading to inventions of new techniques in the health field to heal body injuries.
Romanticism contained a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it was geography that shaped the individual, and over time customs and cultures arose that were related to geography, and these were in harmony with the location of society and were therefore better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris today is known as the capital of fashion in the modern world, Constantinople was considered the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
It is known to be an epicenter of luxury since about 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1,100 A.D.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because crusaders had returned with gifts like silk and spices that had a greater value than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was most prevalent in the period between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
In the beginning, the clothing was largely inspired by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, as a result of the slow communication channels, Western styles could lag behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that is carried out to produce sufficient food to simply meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring like-minded individuals together who feel overlooked by societal standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive because of the age, ethnic background, social class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that regulate a subculture as being distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of several factors.
People who belong to a subculture often signal their affiliation through a clear and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unhappy cases in which children through failure, unhappiness, or willful neglect have not been socialized by adults in their childhood.
Such children are called "wild" or wild. Some feral children have been detained by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, this child failure was caused by the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical impairments.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in nature on their own.
When raised by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) that are almost similar to the animal that has shown concern for the child, such as its fear or lack of interest in humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a support for people who need to learn new things - for example, using a new computer program or restarting a project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software, and aims to question, ask for, and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children come into foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment without nourishment, care and education, but they do so nonetheless.
We see the system for foster families as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
A foster family is tasked with providing all necessities that did not exist in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and satisfaction approach.
For example, it is suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "persistent relationship" were also identified as new motivational factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined the audience's reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the understanding of microexpressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can identify whether a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to a brain injury are nevertheless able to assess sincerity with great accuracy.
He even believes that such abilities to interpret human behavior can also be found in pets such as dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two different pools of genetic variation: the invisible and the visible.
New genetic variation is added via mutation and it is removed from the pool of exact variations via selection."
Separation and recombination mix the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system such as man to satisfy his need for amino acids from available plant sources.
In addition, there are serious consequences of non-compliance: reduced growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins that exist in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, these are difficult to digest unless they are prepared.
Conversely, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest. It also provides large amounts of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep disorder is the process of consciously waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find that you turn off the clock while you sleep, you can place it at the other end of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) prior to sleep, forcing one to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner calm a person possesses corresponds quite the opposite to the amount of tension a person possesses in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. All people have the potential to find absolute calm and satisfaction.
Everyone can learn to understand. The only thing that stands in the way of achieving this goal is our own tension and negativity.
The Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded by the love path of the Mahayana and with a lot of techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is brought to life (enlightenment energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and the enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, the difference in the countries' system, process and culture led to the countries opposing each other.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies now became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest by deputy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, as over 800,000 Red Army soldiers took over and set up the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, as well as other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient way of transporting large quantities of both people and goods across the seas.
The Navy's mission has traditionally been to ensure that your country continues to have the ability to move your people and goods, while also affecting your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II. The Americans attempted to transport soldiers and materials across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which mainly used submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain like the rest of Europe.
As far as we know, goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to hold them so that they could have easy access to milk, fur, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in flocks that wandered on hills or other pastures, often supervised by goat herders who were often children or teenagers, corresponding to the more widely known shepherds.
As early as the 16th century, carriageways were built in England.
Although the carriageways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they meant that horses could pull heavier loads faster than on the slightly more uneven roads of the day.
Slugs were invented quite early, to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that tracks would be more effective if they had an iron piece on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails were used that were made entirely of metal.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the advent of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors Australopithecus did not usually walk upright.
There are bipedal specializations in Australopithecus fossils that are 4.2-3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases like treating symptoms. But if we don’t just want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is obvious that the world has changed greatly due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind, and problems have become greater due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of man.
After Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by President of Congress John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomsen was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
Throughout the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was carried out by John Nixon on July 8 at Independence Hall's farm.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, and on July 9 he had it read to his soldiers in New York.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that still exist are the oldest surviving version of the document. The original handwritten version no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive. We call them birds.
Most people don’t see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information, which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, e.g. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to now use computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general for a diagnosis to be made immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists as a formal description of this group of insects.
This term derives from ancient knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects that live largely as parasites on humans.
Both predators and bedbugs are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to living in their host's house or nest.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the largest neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to get MS than men.
A couple may decide that it is not best for them or their child that they have a baby.
It is possible for these couples to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over them.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works via the scientific method. This method is actually used in most scientific studies.
However, it does not stand alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to remove one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also leads to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek disappeared, the West felt cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many of the observations that have been made in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and the natural, biological production.
Periodic rhythms, which are not responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living beings such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-propelled oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycles, even without external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments where they marked either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the countryside as well as plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird observation and visits to parks as well as studies of information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Where in the morning people leave small villages by car to go to their workplace, and are passed by others whose workplaces are the place they have just left.
On this dynamic transport ferry, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
The decarbonized economy has loosened the biosphere from the stable phase that has supported human development for a few million years, according to science now.
Everyone is part of society and uses the transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is a study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because drivers' behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, motorists typically behave fairly consistently; thus, traffic is also typically fairly consistent and can be calculated mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) current, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These conditions help to plan, design and operate road construction.
Insects were the first animals to fly by. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily dodge enemies and find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a greater choice of small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the dragonfly and the diurnal fly are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
Opinions differed on his theory – some believed he was right, while many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the Earth.
That makes sense, because we can't feel the earth spinning, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second-longest river on earth, containing over eight times as much water as the second-largest river on earth.
The Amazon River is also the world's widest river, and is in some places up to six miles (9.6 km) wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows through the planet’s rivers and into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River collects water from thousands of smaller rivers, but the main river itself is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long.
Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their constructions' size and technical expertise.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, because they are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to dig for if you have the right tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had the theory that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, though he had also had a theory that they change into new substances, to form what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many substances in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You may also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period ending this sentence.
That’s why the pencil was a good friend to most people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the pencil has lost its status and is being used less since new writing methods have appeared.
People now write messages through computer screens and never need to get near a pencil sharpener.
You can only guess what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it requires energy to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
A bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. When the core splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to collapse under little or no influence.
The moon's surface is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the front and 100 km thick on the back.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more moon gardens on the front, as the crust here is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered on figuring out what makes people react or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have become internalized as they become more mature and reach adulthood.
Theories examine what it is about certain people that causes them to perform certain actions, and what elements in their environment cause them to perform or refrain from performing certain actions.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the pyramid of needs, and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can occur when a manager begins to lead his former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is to try to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, making disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, you transform into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has accomplished and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's successes and failures.
This behavior often results in problems between the leaders and the rest of the team.
There are the same expectations for expertise for virtual teams as conventional teams, but there are small differences.
Virtual team members often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of translating organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity begin to emerge when all available resources are used effectively across an organization’s functional departments.
As a result, the process in an organization working together to cope with an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the needs of the customer.
Before an organization can innovate, leaders must create a culture that fosters innovation as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that can help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it narrows the field of research and makes it much more accurate.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us lots of information and materials to build simulation models that can help us understand our mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI includes being able to manufacture machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include checking, scheduling and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwritten recognition, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in the economic, medical, engineering, and military industries, as it has been built into several home computers and software applications for computer games.
Excursions are a big part of any class. Quite often a teacher would love to take his students to places where it is not possible to travel by bus.
The technology offers solutions with virtual excursions. Students can look at museum objects, visit aquariums or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a good method to evaluate an excursion and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital, and each year the website is redesigned, but old versions still exist online as a sort of scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing skills. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally corrects this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to strive to improve in writing in order to avoid criticism.
Additionally, "blogging forces students to learn about the world around them." The requirement to give the audience what they want inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students become more analytical and critical; by providing active response to Internet materials, students can define their roles in relation to what others have written as well as describe their own perspectives on particular topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s charming, bilingual capital and has a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the northern part is home to the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and other areas.
All of these things as well as several highlight Ontario as what is considered genuine Canadian by outsiders.
Further north, there are large areas that are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is a continent of its own when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are associated with France and known for their luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and the religion quickly became widespread in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism started in the 15th century with the discovery by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama of the Cape route between Europe and India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It makes sense to wear what might look like a wedding ring (it just shouldn’t look too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be persecuted, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and don’t be afraid to say no (cultural differences or not, that’s not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to leave it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods such as roofins, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a wide range of trinkets, but it is very touristy.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets in particular in the city center.
Despite the fact that Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated, in order to understand the battles taking place in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano as well as one of the cheapest places to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle-taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Along with the city's relative inaccessibility, it has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, distant regions.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of threatened World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' special Wonders of the African World for PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has a more Arab flair than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and admission fees to the park.
It can also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card, as this either gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all of the South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name, and is the place that many tourists regard as the primary focus area.
The Hong Kong skyline is a group of buildings that, by their reflection in the waters of Victoria Harbour, are often compared to a glittering bar chart,
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The majority of Hong Kong's urban development is tightly packed onto reclaimed land areas along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists made their own, so if you’re looking for evidence of the area’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km from the coast into Bangladesh and India's hinterland.
Sundarbans has been added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part of the forest that is within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not just mangrove swamps; they include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered by water/moss areas.
Sundarbans has been a game reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal king tigers and about 30,000 chital deer in the area.
Buses run from the interregional bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses in the district are often full, it is a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, Japanese buses, which are both comfortable and robust.
Deletaxas are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 m wide.
The vertical ground clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011. It first opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaranís were the most significant group of natives living in the area that is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also farmed to survive.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of native tribes such as the Guaycurús and Payaguás, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of India", came into existence in the 16th century as a result of the meeting of Spanish conquerors and indigenous populations.
The Spanish started the colonization period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve a lot of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the world's best polo teams as well as some of the world's best players.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December on the polo courts of Las Canitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets, check with Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is set equal to the value of a British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the islands located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are often accepted within Stanley.
On the outlying islands, credit cards are unlikely to be used, although UK and US currency may be available; ask the owners in advance to know which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so be sure to exchange your money before leaving the islands.
As Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months it is normal to have temperatures above 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely reach below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than what’s on the thermometer.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must be at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meter away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they look, bison, moose, bears, and virtually all large animals may well attack.
Every year a lot of visitors are injured because they do not keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and can be dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking food that smells, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the setting for a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruise ship. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, which was organized by the Mau Movement, there was a peaceful gathering in the city that resulted in the killing of the chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is close to two ports. The most popular are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most get natural shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are found at Waitemata Harbour in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the sea. It is safe to swim here.
The most widely used local beer is "Number One", which is not a complicated beer but is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps better to transport.
It’s perfectly safe to drink the local tap water, but it’s easy to find bottled water if you’re worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A "short black" is called "espresso", cappuccino has plenty of cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate lives up to the Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but on the other hand excellent.
Many people visit the reef all year round, and people rarely get hurt on the reef for these reasons.
Always listen to the advice of the authorities, read and follow the advice on signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Sea wasps occur near beaches and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally also be found outside these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and want to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live their active lives in the ocean, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Pre-booking gives the traveler peace of mind that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals on certain hotels, although it may be possible for you to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport arrangements to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or provide other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, changes or requests should be addressed to the tour operator first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of participants at music festivals choose to camp on site, and many participants consider it a crucial part of the experience.
If you want to be where it is going, you need to get in early to get a tent site close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the big stages is over, there may still be parts of the festival that play music until late in the evening.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
Check where your cabin is if you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, as sailing through ice can make a lot of noise for those closest to you.
Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions), which is nice to know as cruises to Saint Petersburg give passengers time to see the city.
Casinos do everything they can to ensure that guests spend as much time and as much money as possible. Windows and clocks are usually not present and it can be difficult to find an exit.
They usually have special offers on food, drink and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and keep them in the house.
In some places, alcoholic drinks are offered at the expense of the house. But drunkenness weakens judgment, and all genuine gamblers know how important it is to be sober.
Anyone who has to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice and sub-zero temperatures.
On ice and snowy roads, there is low friction, and you can’t drive as you normally would on dry asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can get you stuck in a very short time.
Visibility can also be limited by snow falling or blowing, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle glazing.
On the other hand, ice and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic is mostly undisturbed all year round.
Safaris are the highlight for many and are perhaps what draws the most tourists to Africa.
The term safari is often used to refer to land trips to see the great African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals such as elephants and giraffes tend to approach the cars, so standard equipment is enough to see the animals.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can better see them with a pair of binoculars.
A hiking safari (also called a "bush walk", "go-safari" or "safari on foot") consists of hikes that either take a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it also hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could be in trouble.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020 when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between $2,500 and $130,000, with typical tickets costing around $7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help to dry it. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow, even if there is no one in the room.
If you don’t have the option to use an iron, or if you don’t like wearing socks that are ironed, try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burns).
There are various ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you are concerned you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they do not know from home.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritations or, in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases in themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people, are not usually perceived as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to purchase goods at specific locations that are exempt from taxes and duties.
Travelers who are heading to countries with a high tax rate can sometimes save significant amounts, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The route between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated terrain in the hinterland.
Be alert if you’re not used to driving on the road: steep hills, narrow lanes and sharp turns are plentiful.
The speed limits set are remarkably lower than on stretches before and after – typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and it is even more important than usual to adhere to them accurately.
Oddly enough, the coverage on mobile phones is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very tasty and varied just like in Germany’s southern neighbour, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common: apples are baked into cakes all year round, and cherries and plums make their appearance during the summer.
Very German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes and a strong cup of coffee often go hand in hand
If you fancy some small, but full-bodied, cakes, you can try what depending on the region is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry is either “dry” or “wet” depending on how much liquid is in it.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries. In southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, it is common to use coconut milk.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an overarching term that covers a wide variety of regional food cultures found throughout the country.
However, if the term is used without further elaboration, it typically refers to the food originally derived from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now the Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago; it consists of a number of single spicy dishes, with the most popular spices being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javan coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Ladders are supports for the rider's feet, which hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can cause safety problems due to the possibility of a rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged along if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, some safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, many riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety harnesses, which cause the stirrup straps to be detached from the saddle if they are pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's largest climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, has a number of large granite walls and cliffs.
Mountain peaks present breathtaking views from the peaks to all visitors. Mountaineers from all over the world are continually establishing new routes among its endless potentials for new climbing walls.
Alpine winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports activities that involve driving down snowy terrains with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a great travel activity with many enthusiasts - sometimes known as "ski bums" who plan the entire holiday around skiing in a particular area.
People have been skiing for thousands of years - cave paintings dating back to the year 5,000 BC show people skiing!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, skiing or hiking.
It is related to, but does not usually involve skiing in alpine style or mountaineering. The latter is carried out in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
You should see the ski route as if it were a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover somewhat greater distances than if you walk – but it is only very rare that you get the same speed as on cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, a trip through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
In this context, however, the Schengen area functions roughly as one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for which manufactured goods are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be less in North America than in Europe, for example.
Handmade products can be categorized as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the culture around it is also important for many Sami with other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami kept reindeer on a large scale, but they lived by fishing, hunting and the like and used mainly reindeer as draught animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern subjects. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami area.
Although the word "gypsy" is often used especially among non-romans, it is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma population.
If travel instructions arise in the country you are visiting, your travel insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
It may also be that you want to get advice from governments other than your own, but their advice will be designed for their own citizens.
One example is that American citizens in the Middle East may be facing a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is only a brief overview of the political situation in a country.
The views put forward are often with a keen eye on the matter, general and simplistic compared to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
Extreme weather conditions are the general term for all dangerous weather phenomena, which can cause damage or serious social disturbances or cost human lives.
Extreme weather conditions can occur all over the world, and there are different types that can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, extreme rainfall, and wildfires are forms of, and effects of, harsh weather like thunderstorms, tornadoes, cloud pumps, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, fumigation, ice blows and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather conditions that may affect their area as this could affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that may be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
A search on the Internet for "Course in hostile environment" will likely give the address of a local business.
A course will usually cover all the topics discussed here with much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will usually last from 2-5 days and will involve role playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes there will be weapons training.
Books and magazines that deal with survival in the wilderness are common, but there are not many publications dealing with war zones.
Travelers planning gender reassignment operations abroad must ensure that they bring valid documents to their return journey.
Governments' willingness to cooperate varies when it comes to issuing passports with unspecified gender (X), or documents that are up to date to give a person a desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies just as much.
Visits at security checkpoints have also become more intrusive in the period since September 11, 2001.
Transgender passengers who have not received surgery should not expect to get through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
The current from waves that return and break on the beach, often at a reef or equivalent, is called a countercurrent.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a rapid flow to deep water can be formed.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue by trying to swim back against the stream, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the flow, it is not harder than normal to swim back.
Try aiming for a place where you won’t be caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you’ve been discovered, you might be able to wait for you to be rescued.
Homecoming shock comes faster than culture shock (there isn’t as much of a period of excitement about the new), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it very difficult to adapt to their own culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that a traveler in a brand new country needs to adapt.
People don’t necessarily expect patience and understanding when they return home.
The Pyramid Sound and Light Show is one of the most interesting activities in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually you always hear the sounds of tourists and sellers. The story of the sound and the light is like a history book.
The sphinx is set as the background and tells of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the various pyramids light up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819 and claimed by many nations, have the most bases, sixteen of which are active in 2020.
The largest is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where an active volcano's flooded caldera provides a spectacular natural harbor area.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula meet on the plateau and form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided into two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range possesses Antarctica's highest mountains, the Vinson Massif (also called Mount Vinson), peaking at 4,892 m.
In remote areas without mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a mobile phone, as you must be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions that need remote data and speech.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One option that is becoming more and more popular for those planning a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among those who leave school, as it allows them to take a year off before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, a course abroad during your gap year can actually improve your chances of getting a place at a higher education in your home country.
There will typically be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for sailors. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes as well as in the archipelagos along the coast.
In the islands and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are big enough for any yacht, you get a different experience in a smaller boat or even a kayak.
Sailing is a national hobby in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is somewhat similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few full days where you go back and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore with the ship's excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises have Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not at all close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
It can be a frightening experience to travel by air for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have not flown before or if they have experienced a traumatizing event.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the fear and hatred of other things that many people suffer from.
For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens when flying can help to overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or not having control.
Delivery companies take great care to deliver quickly. Often, time is very important when it comes to business documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes the larger companies have their own aircraft, but on other routes and in smaller companies there was a problem.
If they sent things by air freight, on some routes it may have taken days to get through unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it through faster was by sending it as checked baggage. The airline regulations don’t allow them to send luggage without a passenger. That’s where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to put a large pile of money rather than get the opportunity (or even better, get your business to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the economy class normal price for business class and eleven times the price for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no reason to look at all for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that certain core groups of passengers are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting ahead quickly and comfortably, and they set their prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any member state of the United Nations.
Economic relations have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the breakdown in political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third largest city with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the country's second largest port after Istanbul, and a very large transport hub.
What was once the old town of Smyrna is now a modern, developed and busy trading town set around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the glass facade buildings and the modern shopping centres are surrounded by traditional red brick roofs, the old 18th-century market and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more Mediterranean-European than traditional Turkey.
The village Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery there are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons over some gravestones.
It is worth spending half an hour walking around the exciting village.
To the north and within reach lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which was made famous among foreigners after a commendation of its magnificence by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north you can also visit the great shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (altar) which is the site of world famous Marian spirits.
Remember that you are actually visiting a mass grave site, a place that is of vital importance to a large part of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who had been murdered or worked to death there, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect that it deserves. Do not tell jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not embarrass the site with markings or by incriminating graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only indicated in Catalan because it has been established by law as the official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used, in public transport and other facilities.
General announcements in the metro are given only in Catalan, but unforeseen changes are announced via an automatic system in several different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an imprecise stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is still to behave as nicely as possible, you should behave like one who is "bien élevé" (well-behaved). This will make it significantly easier to get around.
The cool exterior of Paris evaporates quickly if you show basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Islands National Park is filled with woodlands – mainly beech and coniferous – and offers a mix of both alpine plants and Mediterranean plants.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities due to its many microclimates, different soil types, and varying elevation levels.
The area is also home to an extremely large variety of animals and bird species.
Here you will find, along with many more common species of rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and bull.
During visits to the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees while also having their shoulders covered.
Most of the monasteries have scarves for women who show up unprepared, but if you bring your own and especially some with strong colors, you get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover their knees.
This can be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance, but the clothes will not be washed after each use, so maybe you are not completely comfortable wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
The Majorcan cuisine, like other similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and the use of quite a lot of olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato and any kind of available accessories such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word Say for you, always start with large, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects
It undoubtedly also makes reading easier, although writing is complicated somewhat by the need to find out whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantive form.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to keep an eye on are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the subsequent vowel.
Also, be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means wagon.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly plain grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammatical base book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Just so you know, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese reminds enough of it that one does not have to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not such a problem as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses where they are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Looking at flowering cherry trees, known as Hanami, has been a tradition in Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where flowers from plum trees were the chosen flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor for only himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in a natural environment, therefore, you need to resist the temptation to "just take one sample".
If you visit a publicly accessible garden, you will be thrown out without discussion if you collect "samples".
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to visit and very easy to navigate around, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But when you are in the "high tropes", just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both heat (continually) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is more rare).
There are also a few buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Be sure to check if the bus you are considering taking is driving into Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland waterways can be a good theme to base a holiday around.
For example, to visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, to go on a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or to sail along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays and is celebrated as Jesus' birthday.
Nonbelievers in Christian lands and non-Christians from around the world have embraced many of the traditions of the holidays.
There is a tradition of staying awake on Easter night to watch the sunrise in an exposed place.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a spring and fertility ritual from before Christianity.
The more traditional churches often hold Easter vigils on Saturday evenings during the Easter weekend, where congregations often break out in celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that originally arrived in the islands came here either by swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not cope with the journey, making the giant tortoise the primary grass-eating animal on the Galapagos.
Since the first humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been imported such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see auroras, as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock.
Since there are not many people living in the areas, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their last name or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is important, thus placing emphasis on group effort rather than praise for individual performance.
Workers often need their superiors to approve every decision they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
