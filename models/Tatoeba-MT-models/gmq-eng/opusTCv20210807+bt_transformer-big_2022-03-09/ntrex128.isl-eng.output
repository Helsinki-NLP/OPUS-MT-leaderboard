Welsh stewards worry about 'looking like a fool'
Uggur is in some cabinets due to a proposal to have their title changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The concerns have arisen as a result of a plan to change the Council's name to the Welsh Parliament.
Councillors from all parties are concerned that it might make them a laughingstock.
One councillor from the Labour Party said that his party is concerned that "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers living outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means foolish and pwp means fae.
A councillor from the party Plaid Cymru said that the party as a whole was "unsatisfied" and made other suggestions for the name.
A councillor from the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party had an "open mind" about the name change, but noted that there was not much difference between the word MWP and Muppet (flop).
In this context, it may be noted that the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to u in Icelandic.
The council, which is now working on a legislative proposal to submit the name changes, said: "The final decision on all names held over the members of the council will of course lie with the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Council the power to change its name.
In June, the council released the results of a public opinion poll showing much support for calling the council the Welsh parliament.
As far as the title of councillors is concerned, the Council elected WMP (Welsh Parliament members, Welsh parliamentarians) but the MWP received the most public support in the polls.
According to news reports, councillors are now making other proposals, but it may be difficult to reach an agreement for the chairman of the council, Elin Jones, who is due to present a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform bill will also include other changes to the way the Council works, including rules on the expulsion of councillors and the organisation of the committee system.
Councillors will be able to pay a final vote on their title when discussions on the bill begin.
Macedonians vote in elections to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to "the Republic of North Macedonia."
This case was put to the vote in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own region named Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of their neighbours in the north equals a claim on its territory and has repeatedly protested their applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonia's president, Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the name change, has said that he will not consider the elections as valid.
However, supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have said that the name change is simply the price that needs to be paid to gain membership of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's church bell sound is churches in Harlem are having difficulties
"The elderly people I've spoken to said that in the past you could find a bar and a church on every street corner," Mr Adams said.
“There’s no one there today.”
He said it was understandable that the bar would decrease.
"People have other ways of meeting" these days, he said.
“Bars are no longer the hubs of the neighborhood where people come together regularly.”
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money gained from the sale of property will not last as long as leaders expect "and sooner or later they will be back in a starting slot."
He added that possibly churches would be replaced with residential buildings that would be full of people who will not help save the remaining sanctuaries of the vicinity.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and as a result will accelerate the permanent closure of these churches, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the center of black - the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and St. Martin’s Church a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A congregation of blacks who had worked nearby took over the building.
The Congregation of the Blacks took over St. Martin’s Church under the guidance of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who had the initiative of shunning shoppers on 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping street, who longed to hire black workers or provide them with status raises.
The building was severely damaged in a fire in 1939, but members of the Rev. Johnson's congregation made plans to rebuild it, and they also had the clockwork built.
Rev. David Johnson, son and successor of Rev. Johnson, called the clock game proud "the clock of the poor people."
The expert who played the clock game in July called it another name: "Cultural Treasure" and "a unique historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stated that this was the first clock game in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger clock game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had not received anyone else in his place.
Over the past few months, numerous architects and contractors have made their way to St. Martin, some recruited by the leaders of the church and others by the diocese.
The Council of Churches - which oversees the parish and is appointed to church leaders - wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that the diocese "would seek to bring the cost over to" the Council of Churches, even if it had not been involved in the recruitment of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy who dived after hummingbird in California
According to authorities, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him on Saturday when the boy was diving for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster hunting season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon‘s Beach beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting for help and then messing over along with a group of others to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that he had initially thought it was just excitement to have gotten a chuckle, but then "it became clear to him that the boy was shouting 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
All of his ribs were torn up," said Hammel of what he saw when he came to the boy.
“I shouted at everyone to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!'” added Hammel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he lies seriously injured.
It is not known what type of shark attacked the boy.
The head of the Coast Guard, Larry Giles, said at a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but he was not of a more dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim had suffered serious damage to the upper body.
Authorities closed the beach access from Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to Swami‘s beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, for research and security purposes.
Giles said that there are over 135 different species of sharks in the area, most of which are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s has a plan to stall the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s plans to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetics shelves in a shopping centre style and with specially trained staff.
This is part of a plan to enter the UK cosmetics market, which is worth 2.8 billion pounds and will continue to grow as sales of fashion and household goods go down. The larger cosmetics shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be installed in more stores next year if successful.
Investing in cosmetics is part of a way for supermarkets to use shelf space that was previously utilized by televisions, microwave ovens, and home appliances.
Sainsbury’s says it plans to double its cosmetic range to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get increased space with marked areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The store also plans to re-launch sales of its Boutique cosmetics range so that the majority of the products are vegan-friendly, but younger consumers increasingly demand it.
In addition, the fragrance shop Fragrance Shop will test merchandise in Sainsbury’s two stores, the first opened in Croydon, south London last week and the next one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the increased tendency of consumers to buy small amounts of food daily in neighborhood stores means supermarkets need to put more effort into getting people to come to them.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury’s CEO, said the stores would look more like shopping malls as the retail chain tries to fight the low-priced stores of Aldi and Lidl with more services and products than food.
Sainsbury’s has put Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat stores since both chains were purchased two years ago. According to them, it has increased sales and made the purchase more profitable.
The store's first attempt to revive its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury’s tried a partnership with Boots around the year 2000, but it ended due to disagreements over how to share the proceeds of drug sales in supermarkets.
The new policy follows Sainsbury’s selling its 281 drugstores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds drugstores, at 125 million pounds three years ago.
Under the policy, Lloyds will have a role in these plans by adding a wide range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Marketing Director, said: “We have revolutionised the look of our cosmetics shelves to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in special training for staff who will be on hand for advice.
Our brand range is designed to meet all your needs. Enthusiastic environments and convenient locations make us an exciting cosmetics store that transforms old shopping habits."
Peter Jones 'premeditated' after Holly Willoughby cancels 11-million-pound deal
Peter Jones, the star of the show Dragons Den, became "infuriated" after television presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled an ?11 million deal with his company to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their homeware and accessory brand, Truly.
The company had been likened to Goop, a trademark of Gwyneth Paltrow.
Willoughby, a 37-year-old presenter on This Morning, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons’ Den, with the painful end result of retiring from a popular lifestyle company at the last minute to focus on new and lucrative deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "advanced" at a difficult meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire when the television woman popularly admitted she did not have enough time for the homeware and accessory brand Truly due to the new contracts worth up to ?1.5 million pounds.
The company has been likened to Goop, the brand name of Gwyneth Paltrow, and was intended to double Willoughby's assets, whose estimated value is 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was going to pull out of Truly, Jones flew from the UK to stay at one of her many summer homes.
A source said: “Truly, Holly’s list of priorities was the longest.
This was to be her future project that would earn her income for the next two decades.
Her decision to leave was a complete blow to everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so short in that the line went to market.
There is a full stock of products in Marlow's headquarters that are ready to go on sale."
Experts believe that the disappearance of This Morning, which is among the UK's most popular stars, could cost the company millions due to heavy product investments, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household goods, and possibly cause further delays in the product line going on sale.
It could also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for decades.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, aged 52, joined them as chairman in March.
The couples spend their summer vacations together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's company, which produces television content.
Willoughby will be the official representative of the brand M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the ITV show's host I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We don't want to say anything about his business affairs."
It was a tough conversation, and then we fell in love.
He grappled with the criticism he received from the media, for saying something that many would consider inappropriate for a president, and for being so positive towards North Korea's leaders.
Why has President Trump done so much?
Trump said, echoing a reporter's voice.
“I haven’t given anything.”
He stated that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
However, talks to lay down nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's main ambassador, told international leaders in the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not received a "appropriate response" from the United States at the first steps North Korea towards nuclear disarmament.
He said that instead, the U.S. continued to maintain trade ties for the purpose of maintaining pressure.
Trump was more positive in his speech.
“We are very close to North Korea,” he said.
“We’re going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
Our relationship is great now.”
He said his attempts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results - missile tests had ceased, hostages had been released, and the remains of American soldiers were returned home.
He also defended his unusual approach in discussing his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into a crowded stadium, there were only 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia cause major damage to island, hundreds have perished
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, an international relief organization was told that they were not needed.
Although over 10 percent of the population of Lombok had to flee their homes, a state of emergency was not declared, but it is a prerequisite for international organizations to begin aid operations there.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not going to ask for help from international organizations, so this is difficult," Ms. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known when foreign aid workers can start work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the country's disaster agency, said that Indonesian advisers were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations should be allowed to assist in the relief effort.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is woefully ill-prepared to defend against the forces of nature.
Flood defences have been constructed in Aceh, but they are rare sighted at other shorelines.
It seems that the threat of tsunami-preventive waves in Palu has still increased casualties, even though a warning has been issued.
Even in the best of circumstances, it can be a challenge to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make planning even more complex.
A medical vessel that has been docked in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new crash site.
President Joko Widodo made it a key point of his election campaign to reform Indonesia's run-down transportation routes and he has invested a lot of money in roads and railways.
However, a lack of funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration, but elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also has to contend with ongoing tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority have adopted more conservative religious policies.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as the gang of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets with swords, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool player, equals against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's match at the Stamford Bridge stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal as his team was under 1-0.
He rolled the ball to the left and then attempted a shot towards the far bar.
The ball flew high over the goal and towards its right corner.
The ball eventually crossed Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumped up, and into the net.
"I just wanted to try to get to this position, to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play it as long as possible so I tried to create as much time as I could," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come and touch once and didn’t think much about it, but just took the shot.”
Chelsea were over 1-0 at half time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
On the offensive, the Chelsea striker gave the ball with a heel kick to Mateo Kovacic and then bounced from the middle to the Liverpool playing half.
Kovacic made the ball move quickly between the middle.
Then he sent the ball forward splendidly and sent Hazard in for a penalty kick.
Hazard ran the defenders off and scored in the far corner with a left-footed shot passed by Alisson Becker, Liverpool's goalkeeper.
Liverpool play against Naples in the Premier League final at 15:00 on Wednesday at the San Paolo stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play against Videoton in the UEFA European League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Death toll rises to 832 after tsunami in Indonesia
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to a report from the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said at a news conference that a number of people had been buried when buildings collapsed in the Friday earthquake, which was 7.5 points on the Richter scale. The quake caused tsunamis that reached up to 6 meters in height.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with debris from buildings that had collapsed.
Police arrest 32-year-old man, suspected of murder, after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with a stab wound was found at 7:55 a.m. near Grayson Mews on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested, suspected of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to come forward if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has just begun, but I would ask all those who were in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they saw or heard anything suspicious.
Also, I would ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who could have achieved something on camera with their car cameras to contact us, because they could have important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who died lived in Birkenhead and that she was found inside an apartment.
This afternoon, people who thought they knew the woman have come to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and police say they are working to let the victim's closest relatives know.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to get back to his apartment, but police told him that no one could enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have now been told that many hours could pass until they can go back inside.
A police officer was heard to say that the entire area now considered to be the scene of a crime.
A crying woman came to the scene.
She kept saying, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2 p.m. there were two police cars inside the marked area of the police and one car just outside it.
A number of police officers stood within the marked area and watched the apartment buildings.
Anyone who might have any information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crime Line anonymously on telephone 0800 555 111 and give the number 247 from 30 September.
The British Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the latest monument accused of "rewriting history"
The statue's prohibition would be a poetic justice for the Taliban destruction of his fanatical Puritan followers on so many cultural and religious jewels of England.
However, the Cromwell Society said Mr. Crick's proposal was "a futile" and "an attempt to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace would be beaten.
The spirit of the English Civil War against cultural symbols was neither Cromwell's command nor execution.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the preceding century.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a landmark of the 19th-century era and is part of the history of a man that many believe still deserves praise.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps rather in the late 19th century than today, to have been a protector of Parliament against external pressure, in his case the monarchy.
There is still much historical dispute as to whether this description is entirely correct.
However, it is certain that the conflicts that were in the mid-17th century have shaped the development of our nation and that Cromwell is a well-known individual who represents one side of that conflict.
It is worth celebrating and commemorating his achievements as a protector of the state."
Pig attacks Chinese farmer and kills him
A pig attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him in a market in southwestern China, according to local news reports.
The man, who is named only by his last name "Yuan", was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood near a stutter at the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, according to news from the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine into a pig in a pigsty on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He reportedly had traveled with his uncle from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and saw that the door into the nearby pigsty was open.
He said that inside the stanza there had been a large gorilla with a bloody mouth.
A court investigation confirmed that the 250 kg rascal had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's feet were bloodied and wounded," said the cousin, with the surname "Wu", to the Guiyang Evening News.
A recording from a security camera showed Yuan coming to the market at 4:40 in the morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his uncle.
The market's owner told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that it did not attack anyone else while police collected evidence at the scene.
According to news reports, Yuan's family and market owners are in talks about compensation for his death.
There are recorded examples of pigs attacking people, although it is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 kg pig clipped a Welsh farmer to a tractor until his wife threw the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that a taste of blood can provoke aggression in them.
“They’re just playing.
They like to gloat and are curious...they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them the proper respect," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa carry heavy rainfall across the southwestern United States
As predicted, the intensity of Hurricane Rosa is declining as it crosses cooler seas on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry heavy rainfall that could cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rose became a Category 1 hurricane, with winds of 136 km per hour, at 5 a.m. to east coast time on Sunday, and it was located over 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is scheduled to head north on Sunday.
At the same time, there is a depression in formation over the Pacific Ocean and it will go east towards the western coast of the United States. When Rose arrives at the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will therefore follow a large tropical storm in the northwards into the southwestern part of the United States.
Rose will follow up to 25 cm of rainfall in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical ray will mix with the approaching depression, forming a large and widespread rainfall over the southwest in the coming days.
Localized 2.5 to 10 cm of rainfall can cause dangerous flash floods, movement of soil, and possible landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical rains will cause up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation in an hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation is expected in some places in the southwest, especially in most Arizona states.
There is a possibility of flash floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the dispersion of tropical rains.
People are strongly advised against going on foot into the desert when there is a risk of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into belligerent rivers, and thunderstorms result in rapids and dust storms.
The approaching sediments will carry local debris in certain areas along the Southern California coastline.
There is a possibility of over 1 cm of precipitation which could cause slight movement of the soil and slippery roads.
This is the first rainfall of the area during the rainy season.
Several scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before rainfall spreads across a larger area late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread across four states on Tuesday and will last through Wednesday.
Major changes in temperature are expected in October everywhere in the United States as the Arctic region cools, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this can cause high temperature fluctuations over short distances.
There was a very good example of a large heat difference in the central United States on Sunday.
There is a nearly 7 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent summer chills will try to build up and dissipate again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to warm early October with temperatures around 25 degrees or more from the southern plains all the way to the northeastern states.
Temperatures could go up to 25 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast suggests that there is a high probability of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. in the early part of October.
More than 20 million people have been interviewed by Brett Kavanaugh.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s exciting testimony on Tuesday and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual misconduct that was supposed to have occurred in the 1990s. The testimony was broadcast on six different channels.
At the same time, the political stalemate continued and television stations interrupted a regular schedule to publish the latest news on Friday: Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, proposed a bill for the FBI to investigate the allegations for one week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was confident that Kavanaugh had drunk on her and tried to undress her at a school party.
Kavanaugh said in emotional testimony that he was confident that it had not happened.
It is likely that more people watched the trial than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported watching on Friday.
The company measured average ratings on the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC television channels.
Numbers were not available immediately for other television channels showing the interrogations, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people's views in offices.
To put this in context, this audience is similar in size to that of a football final or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, most people watched the interviews, which took all day, on Fox News Channel or 5.69 million. The opinion polls of that channel have loyally supported Kavanaugh's nomination.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the trial.
Flake was the centerpiece of the game on Friday.
After the office of this member of the Republican Party issued an announcement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameramen obtained photos of when protesters made a call to him on Friday morning, as he attempted to enter an elevator to get to a meeting with the Judiciary Committee.
He stood slumped for a few minutes while shame rained on him live on CNN.
One woman said, “I’m standing right here in front of you.”
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
People said to him, “You have power while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office released a statement and before closing the elevator doors he said he would comment further at the committee's meeting.
The cable and television stations all had live broadcasts later when the Judiciary Committee voted on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should be forwarded to the Senate.
Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee next week, but a minority of Democrats have urged it.
Flake was partly convinced after a conversation with his friend, Chris Coons, a Democratic senator.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several other senators thereafter.
Flake's vote changed dramatically because it was evident that Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has authorized an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'being in a political game' over Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "being in a political game" about Britain's future and undermining the country's interests.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, will attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published alongside her interview on the front page of the paper, Boris Johnson, her former Secretary of State, granted the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the suggestion that the UK and the European Union should charge tariffs on each other was "completely disingenuous".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpsons in connection with LSU player's death
Police have arrested one suspect in the death of Wayde Sims in a fatal shooting. He was a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge police.
Authorities released a video of the clashes between Sims and Simpson, saying Sims had lost his glasses in the clashes.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found genetic material from Simpson on them, according to WAFB, a CBS sister company.
Police say Simpson confessed to questioning having shot Wayde and had him killed.
According to his lawyer, a certain bail amounted to $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge County coroner's office released a preliminary report on Friday saying the cause of death is a gunshot to the head and down the throat.
Authorities wanted to thank the Louisiana Police Department, the Police Crime Investigation Bureau, the Southern University Police Department, and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, chairman of sports at LSU, thanked law enforcement officials for "their diligence and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall two-yard forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He scored 5.6 points on average and took 2.6 performances for each game in the last season.
Will Wade, LSU's basketball coach, said on Friday morning that the team was "harmed" and "in shock" due to Wayde's death.
"It's something you worry about all the time," Wade said.
A volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased in the crater, and 183 cases of gas and ash were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center observed vibrations and tremors from the volcano.
Photos on social media showed a thin layer of ash on car windows in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as in Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since an earthquake of 7.1 on Richter struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatists just before the anniversary of independence referendum
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent protesters took on riot police and thousands took part in protests on the occasion of the first anniversary of the controversial election in Catalonia to declare independence.
A group of masked separatists stoned riot police with eggs and threw powder paint forming dark clouds of dust in the streets, which were usually otherwise full of tourists.
Fighting also broke out later in the day, and police used batting to keep the fighting at bay.
Groups of separatists shouted, "We will not forget and we will not forgive" for a few hours while their opponents shouted against, "Long live Spain."
Fourteen needed support due to minor injuries suffered during the protests, according to local media.
A great deal of tension continues in the independent-minded area one year after the October 1 referendum was ruled illegal by the authorities in Madrid, but was welcomed by the Catalan separatists.
The majority of voters voted for independence, but participation was poor as most of those opposed to separation ignored the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police attempted to stop the election at polling stations across the area, which resulted in a conflict.
Groups of independents had stayed out overnight on Friday to prevent protests in support of the country's police.
The protest went ahead but was forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, took part in separatist protests with his wife, saying that he was no longer hopeful that Catalonia would gain independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy over being able to marry but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved a necessary but narrow victory in the regional elections in December, Catalonia's independence parties have had a hard time holding steam this year, with many of their most prominent leaders being either in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial due to their role in the planning of the vote and the declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took the protest in support of the police to her phone, said that politicians from both sides had urged the dispute.
“The tension is constantly increasing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been imprisoned and awaiting trial since late last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"My campaign in the European elections is the best way to condemn the retreat in the field of democratic values and the repression that we have seen the Spanish government exert," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after car driven to house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after driving repeatedly at a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m. British time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said that the gate and the building itself had been damaged.
It is also possible that the shot was from a crossbow towards the vehicle.
Menga scores in Livingston's 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal secured Livingston's victory
Livingston's team, coming from the lower division, came into the open shield and Steven Gerrard had to endure his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox team.
Mark Dolly Menga made the fortune, and Gary Holt's team is now in second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team has not yet won on the field in the Premier League this season and is playing against Hearts, who are eight points ahead in the top spot, next Sunday.
For that game, the Rangers will face Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston is still undefeated in the league with six wins, and head coach Holt has not yet had to experience a loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against biting visitors
Holt's team should have been over long before it scored a goal, but their direct hit caused Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then missed after slipping through the defense to receive a scallop pass from Graig Halkett across the goal.
The hosts had the Rangers play in front of them in quiet, knowing that they could cause the guests trouble in the right places.
And that’s how the goal was scored.
Rangers got extra kicks, and Livingston worked to create a goal opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga combine, who accepted a pass and scored from the middle of a penalty shootout.
At that point, the Rangers had dominated the ball, but the defense of the locals was unbreakable and Liam Kelly, the goalkeeper did not have to put in much effort.
Thus, this continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by the feet of Allan McGregor, the Rangers' goaltender, and Lithgow shot from goal after an attack from Livingston.
Questions constantly landed in Livingston's penalty area but were kicked off, and two demands for a penalty kick - after Halkett's defense against substitute Glenn Middleton, and one after his hand - were dismissed.
'Beautiful' at Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland reporter at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Great performance and results for Livingston.
For an ordinary man, they performed wonderfully and continued to exceed all expectations on their way up.
Their style of play and teammates have hardly changed since their return to the top division, but Holt deserves much credit for polishing the team together from their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, captain was extremely good and led a fully organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes the whole time.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they have been under Gerrard's control, they played far below expectations.
They failed badly to complete their offensives and only managed to open the field half of the locals once so this should be a wake-up call for the Rangers who are now sitting in the middle of a league.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
There was a smile and a bright sky on Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met over breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which has the purpose of improving the relationship between the two nato nations.
Disputes have arisen between them over issues such as human rights, media freedom and Turkey's entry into the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, giant mosque.
The city is home to most Turkish residents outside of Turkey itself.
The police used security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters showed up in its vicinity to see its president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them Kurds - also voiced and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
The two opposition groups reflect how controversial this guest is, but he is hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and hated as a dictator by others.
Deptford crash: Motorcyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist died in a car accident in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, at around 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics provided support, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The collision occurred a few months after another cyclist died in a collision where the driver drove off on Childers Street, 1.5 km from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
Police said she was working to identify the man and let his closest relatives know.
The road has been closed and direct bus services have been provided, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Injured in Riots
Six detainees were injured when riots broke out in a men's security prison, according to a report from a prison agency.
Riots broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at around 9.30 a.m. British local time on Sunday and are still raging.
"Tornado" special forces have been called to the area to try to contain the riots, involving eight detainees, and are only in one eel of the prison.
The guards received accolades due to minor injuries to the face at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison said: “Specialized prison guards have been called out to deal with cases that are ongoing in Long Lartin Prison.
Six employees have been injured.
No violence has passed in our prisons and we make it clear that the responsible people will be handed over to the police and could be expected to spend even more time behind bars."
More than 500 prisoners are in Long Lartin prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the warden had had to go to hospital after a prisoner attacked him.
And in October of last year, riot police were called to the scene to deal with a serious disturbance of peace, attacking staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rose threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash floods (drying areas might benefit)
It is rare for tropical depression to pass over Arizona, but it is likely to be early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa pass over the southwest portion, with a risk of flash floods.
The country's weather agency has already issued warnings of flash floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and western Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rose is scheduled to cross Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive late Monday with rainfall.
The Phoenix Weather Bureau said on Twitter that only "ten hurricanes have managed to maintain strength to be classified as tropical storms or depressions less than 200 miles away from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 40 miles (64 km) from the Arizona border."
Latest forecasts from the country's hurricane center predict 5-10 cm of precipitation, with occasional rainfall up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Precipitation is likely to be 2.5 to 5 cm in other areas in the southwest, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, with the possibility of occasional rainfall of up to 10 cm.
For those who are not at risk of experiencing flash floods, the rainfall from Rosu could be a blessing because there are great droughts in the area.
Although floods can cause great damage, some of this rainfall will have a positive effect, as drought is now in the southwest.
According to the U.S. drought watchdog, at least, there is an extremely high rate of drought in over 40 percent of Arizona, but it is the second-highest category," according to news from weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rose was still classified as a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind strength of 136 km per hour and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, traveling north at 19 km speed per hour.
The storm passes over cooler seas in the Pacific Ocean and so its power declines.
It is expected to land in Mexico as a tropical storm in the afternoon on Monday or Monday night.
There is potential for heavy rainfall in some areas of Mexico, with a significant risk of flooding.
"A rainfall of 7.5 to 15 cm is expected in Baja California and into the northwestern part of Sonora, with a potential for up to 25 cm of precipitation," said in a statement from weather.com.
Rose will then remain north across Mexico, as a tropical storm, and then reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. She will then continue up through Arizona and arrive in southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest risk that is expected to stem from Rosa or her remains is extremely heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and in the southwestern desert region of the United States," the country's hurricane center said.
These rainfalls are expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and movement of soil in the desert, and creep in the mountainside.
The Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The juvenile was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at about 4 a.m. local time on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital, where his condition is said to be "stable".
One 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to police from Avon and Somerset.
Police have asked witnesses who may have phone records of what happened to present themselves.
Trump says Kavanaugh "got to feel the evil and the anger" from the Democratic Party
"A vote in support of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the Democratic Party's ruthless and outrageous tactics," Trump said at a meeting with supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "got to feel the malice and anger" from the Democratic Party out of his entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before parliament on Thursday, strongly denying allegations from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her several decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified before the committee about its allegations.
The president said on Saturday that "the Americans had seen the genius and the humanity and the courage" of Kavanaugh the other day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that confirms one of the smartest lawyers of our time, a lawyer with an impressive career record as a public official," he said to a group of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republican supporters taking part in the midterm elections.
“There are five weeks in one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't offer, but I really do," he said.
"That's why I'm going all over the world to fight for great candidates."
Trump claimed that Democrats are working to "tether and block."
The first key vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination should take place no later than Friday, according to a Republican leadership assistant in an interview with CNN.
Hundreds of people died after an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and it is likely that the number of dead will rise
At least 384 people were killed and many were washed away by huge waves on the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when as many as six meters high waves would be on the beach at sunset, flushing out scores of people at sea and destroying everything that happened to them.
The tsunami formed after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Richter.
"When the tsunami threat formed yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they lost their lives," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster agency, told an information meeting in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, trees, houses, it hit everything that was on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open ocean at 800 miles before hitting the coast.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, turned and ruined bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to ride over the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was observed in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia's foundation on food and technology use, said in a statement that the energy released during the major quake on Friday had been approximately 200 times greater than that from the atomic bomb dropped on the city of Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho said the damage was "significant" and that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of several victims were found trapped under debris from collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and property damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km north from Palu in an area known as the Donggala, which is closer to recording the earthquake.
Communication "lies completely down and no information is received" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"Over 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," said the Red Cross.
The agency was criticized by many on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, though official officials said the waves had arrived within the time the warning was issued.
In a video posted on social media, a man could be heard shouting from the upper floor of a building to warn the people on the street below that a tsunami was approaching.
Just minutes later, the tsunami hits the beach, carrying away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that hindered communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to plan relief efforts.
The military has begun sending planes with relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but people who have been helped by the area are still badly in need of food and other necessities.
The city's airport has only been reopened for relief operations and will be closed until October.
Joko Widodo, the president, is planning to visit Palu refugee centers on Sunday.
The number of deaths exceeds 800 after a tsunami in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
World Vision staff from Donggala have reached the city of Palu safely, where they seek shelter in the tented cities set up in the park outside their offices. Destruction hit them on the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
"People said they've seen a lot of houses completely destroyed," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Aid groups have begun difficult relief efforts, but some have complained that foreign aid workers with a high level of expertise were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel may only begin to arrive if the accident area is declared a disaster zone.
It hasn't been done yet.
"This is still a local accident area," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared this a disaster area, we can open for foreign aid, but no statement has yet been made."
As the second night fell upon Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and their families, who are still missing, held out in the hope that their loved ones would become one of the miraculous stories that shed hope over the depressing headlines that follow natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a rut.
On Sunday, aid workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body at her side.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian glider team, had been the coach of two gliders, who are now missing, for the Asian Games which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped inside the Roa Roa hotel were his students, including Mr. Monday.
"As a man with a long experience in hovercraft, I have my own emotional burden to bear," he said.
Mr Gendon reported that the hours after news was received within the glider group that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed, he had sent a WhatsApp message in desperation to the competitors who stayed in Palu and participated in the beach festival.
His message, however, showed only a gray mark, instead of a blue one.
"I think that means the message wasn't received," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 when refilling an ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed $26,750 from Brink's employee, who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been emptying an ATM in the entertainment area and was about to fill more money on him, said Dennis McCarthy, a police officer, in the announcement.
As he was doing his jobs, another man came "running behind the Brink employee" and stole a money bag intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects escape from the scene, according to the report, but police did not disclose how many were involved in the case.
Those who might have information about the suspects are asked to contact Newport Police on telephone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Kanye West wants to change his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, writing, "The vera that used to be known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes before his participation in the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grandi in the show, but she quit for "emotional reasons", the show's producer said.
West has previously said that this name has religious meaning for him, but it is also a shortening of his current name.
"I think 'ye' (you) is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year when discussing the name of his album with radio broadcaster Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, meaning the one, and into just Ye - being just a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are."
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former colleague of West's, has also written his name both with and without strings and capitals.
Mexico's President-elect vows not to use the military against ordinary citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Mexico's elected president, has vowed never to use military force against ordinary citizens, now the country will soon remember the 50th anniversary of bloody revenge against students.
On Saturday in Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised to "never ever use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
Soldiers fired on a peaceful protest march in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were shooting roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico by giving all students a monthly stipend and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of learning opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence
Now that China is increasingly active in the use of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the funding it spends on research in that field, says inventor and artificial intelligence user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after different sections of the U.S. government issued reports of artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. has no formal overall plan for artificial intelligence.
However, China announced its plan last year: it aims to be first in innovation with artificial intelligence by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the funding, which goes into artificial intelligence research, given that all other countries are so much further behind the United States, and we are waiting to see the next big discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," said Lee.
The doubling of funding could double the likelihood of the next major discovery in artificial intelligence being made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the major artificial intelligence companies in China.
He worked on an artificial intelligence system in the 1990s at Carnegie Mellon University, which won the best player in the United States in Othello, and later he was CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese department at Google.
Lee talked about previous technical competitions, which were held by the U.S. authorities, such as the Defense Department's robotic competition, and asked when the next competition would be held, to spot the next pioneers.
Scientists in the United States often have to put a lot of effort into getting funding from the government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking the big ideas, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired geniuses from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies could also help the United States strengthen its artificial intelligence research.
"I think those who have a PhD in artificial intelligence should be granted a residence permit automatically," he said.
China's Congress released its Future Artificial Intelligence Program in July 2017.
China's Institute of Natural Sciences provides funding to people working at universities, similar to the National Science Foundation and similar public institutions do in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up an artificial intelligence center, intended to cooperate with both the industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
In terms of NSF, it invests over $100 million annually in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, U.S. legislation designed to create a Security Council on Artificial Intelligence has not progressed for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
Macedonia's residents voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" in an attempt to resolve decades-old differences with Greece, which has blocked their application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a region named Macedonia and claims that their neighbour's name in the north equals a claim on their territory, thus denying them entry to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the identity of the majority of Macedonia's population of Slavic origin.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the vote and a campaign to ignore it has raised doubts that participation will reach the 50 percent minimum required so that the vote will be considered valid.
The question on the ballot is this: “Do you want to join NATO and the EU by agreeing to the deal with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that this is a fair fee for Macedonia to gain membership in alliances such as the EU and NATO, but the country is one of those formed after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgiyevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said that they will comply and bind it into law.
The name change would require the approval of two-thirds of the Senate.
The election committee said that nothing unusual had been reported at 1 a.m.
However, the participation rate was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent participation in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in the Macedonia referendum on whether to change the country's name, which would make its way into NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, worked on preparing a small stage and setting up chairs in front of tents that had been erected by those who will ignore the vote.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to become members with a head high, not go through the service door," Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn something else like to China or Russia and become part of an Eurasian relationship."
Prime Minister Zaev says that membership of NATO will bring the necessary funding to Macedonia, where the percentage of the unemployed is over 20 percent.
“I think the vast majority will agree that over 80 percent of the population is in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
He said that consent would be "confirmation of our future."
A poll published Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, but that is lower than the minimum required.
Another poll from the Telma TV channel, showed that 57 percent of respondents were going to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said yes.
So that the national vote is considered valid, attendance must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote is not approved, it could mean the first serious blow to the government's policy, which is favoured by the West, since it took office in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, goes through all of Brighton's defences and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took Brighton's defence lightly in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a transmission in the middle of the field at the start of the offensive.
He bounced past three Brighton defenders and then went out to the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green-clad defenders.
He got past one defender and then ran away from several more just off Brighton's offensive line.
Then he sent to the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used the first touch within the penalty area to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to play Mathew Ryan, Brighton's goalkeeper, with a shot to the right side of the goal.
"Aguero has some foot problems," said Pep Guardiola, City's manager, to reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then it happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at this moment."
But it was Sterling who gave them the first blue goal in the Premier League game.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a pass far inside Brighton's field half in that parish.
He sent a magnificent long ball to the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball several times and then sent on Sterling towards the far bar.
City forward sent the ball into the net just before it ran out.
City play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League at 12.55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a knockout game against the Rockies
As the Nationals team has been excluded from playing in the finals, there was not much reason to force a second start.
However, the aggressive Scherzer hopes to get a pitch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a chance of making the playoffs, but they have a one-game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division.
The Rockies were at least given a "wildcard" seat with their 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but the team still strives to reach their first league title.
“Even if we play for free, we can at least play for the electric atmosphere in Denver, as well as the other team will definitely be playing their best game this year.
Why shouldn't I want to compete in such situations?"
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be the first pitcher in Sunday's game, but it is believed that they will have Scherzer thrown in these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was starting a game for the 34th time, took a practice session on Thursday and would pitch on Sunday which is his usual rest day.
This right-handed pitcher at Washington has an 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 wind hits in 220 2/3 innings during this season.
Trump to visit West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the case around Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court justice when he spoke of the importance of Republican supporters taking part in the midterm elections.
“It’s all in November.
That’s five weeks into one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big...I don't volunteer, but do it though, that's why I go around the world to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, “You see this horrible, radical group of Democrats, you can see it happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, you see the cruelty, the evil.
They don't care who they hurt, over whom they have to go to gain power and control, they just want to gain power and control, we don't give them that.
He said that Democrats are working to "teach and block."
"And it has been seen in the last four days," he said, saying the Democrats are "anger and evil and cruel and untruthful."
He named Senator Dianne Feinstein, the incumbent Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and was answered with loud baubles from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?”
Were you the one who read the paper?
Ha, what.
No, look no. I waited for one... it was really bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer an tolerant church.
He hates those who do not speak his mind.
When the activists of Momentum in my party chose to give me a reprimand, it was hardly surprising.
I am, after all, the last of many Labour MPs to have been told that we are not welcome, just for expressing our minds.
Joan ryan, my associate received similar treatment because she strongly objected to prejudice against Jews.
In my case, the suggestion to give me an apology was made because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues were the importance of having responsible economic policies, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting for Nottingham East on Friday said that "we want the meetings to leave no one out and be successful."
In my eight-year career as a member of the Labour Party, Friday meetings have long been just that.
Unfortunately, it is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of a "milder and better" politics has been forgotten, if it ever started them.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not passed in the Labour Party and that all opinions are judged according to whether the leaders of the party consider them acceptable.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I previously thought had similar political views as I did, began to expect me to take a complete turnaround and support views I had never previously agreed with, whether it was on national security or a common EU market area.
Every time I speak publicly - and little does it matter what I say - there follows a series of insults on social media calling for my expulsion, central politics denied, and I said I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
This is not just my experience.
I know I am luckier than some of my colleagues, as most of the comments I get are political.
I admire the professionalism and affirmation of those who have to endure the hollowness of sexual or prejudiced insults on a daily basis but never retreat.
One of the biggest disappointments of this political period is how attacks and insults have become a normal part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should nurture a more tolerant culture.
The reality is that we are no longer a tolerant church, and with every mistrust or change of choice the party becomes ever narrower.
I’ve had a lot of advice in the last two years about being low, not having too high, and then I’d be ‘okay’ with me.
But I didn’t want to get involved in politics.
Since I became a member of the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, encouraged by the neglect of the Thatcher government that left my classroom in disrepair, I have fought for better public services for those who need it most, whether I was in local government or in Congress.
I have never hidden my political views, nor during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my views on policy and where I disagree with the current leaders.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that as the country heads for Brexit, which will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy in my loyalty to the leaders of the Labour Party.
But my only message I want to send out is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to those within my constituency, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I serve you with pride and I promise that no threats of anomaly or political expulsion will deter me from doing what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated team Ayr goes to the top
Two late touchdowns may have somewhat skewed the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the win in this momentous match of the day in Tennent's Premiership league.
They are now at the top of the list and the only team out of ten that is still undefeated.
Ultimately, it was their stronger defense and better use of opportunities that made the locals more successful, and Coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We've had a lot of opposition in our games so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ayr on credit, they took their chances better than us,"
Mark Grant Anderson came over to Ayr in the 14th minute after Frazier Climo turned the offense around, but a yellow card on the Scottish captain, who was allowed to play the game with the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot managed to score a touchdown.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by penalty before scoring with a kick just before half time and then a touchdown, bringing Ayr over 17-5 at half time.
But Melrose started the second half with power and Patrick Anderson's touchdown, after Baggot turned the offense around, reduced the goal difference to five points.
A long break was then needed to nurture a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott, who had to carry off a field of play, after which Ayr still increased his lead with a touchdown from Stafford McDowall, after Climo turned the offensive back.
Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, was then given the yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of being a man over with a touchdown from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a tough quest.
However, the homers came back strong and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for conceding Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind the Ayr offensive, after an extra kick.
Climo turned the offense around, as he did again immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe caught kick David Amrstrong from the penalty spot and sent to Gregor Henry who scored the team's fifth touchdown.
Star Still Game episodes ready for a new career in the restaurant sector
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game franchise, seems ready to move into restaurant business after finding out he was hired as the manager of a restaurant company.
Kieran, 56, plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and plays in with his old partner from the entertainment industry, Creg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last, and it appears Kiernan has plans for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the Managing Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to say anything about the news, but a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to become a participant in the Glasgow City's "live restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': Bolivia's coastless country hopes court will reopen way to Pacific
Marines guard the naval headquarters in La Paz.
General Buildings Flags Blue Flags.
Floating stations from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are marked with the slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It’s our duty to restore it.”
Throughout the landlocked Bolivia the memory of the coastline, which was lost to Chile in a bloody conflict in the 19th century, remains in fresh memory - along with the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes are perhaps the strongest in decades, now that Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice in The Hague on October 1 after five years of lengthy litigation.
"Bolivia possesses the power, the spirit of unity and the nobility, and of course awaits the verdict with a positive mind," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the International Court of Justice's ruling on large screens across the country, in the hope that the court in The Hague will rule in Bolivia's favor on their demand that Chile be obliged to grant Bolivia access to the sea, after many decades of difficult dialogue.
The ruling on Monday is also extremely important for Evo Morales, the country's president of Indian descent who will have a controversial fight for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to favor Bolivia, and that doing so would make little difference.
The court, which is headquartered in the Netherlands, has no authority to grant land from Chile and has ruled that the ruling will not affect the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the court's ruling comes just six months after listening to the final speeches indicates that the case "didn't have been complicated," said Paz Sárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
It is also possible that the last four years have not been the case for Bolivia to advance, but have caused the country to return.
"The current government of Bolivia has stolen the issue of access to the sea," Zárate said.
Morales's militant rhetoric has discouraged any goodwill from Sile, she believed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the former president of Bolivia and the country's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision had taken an unusually short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "a unique opportunity to open up a new relationship with Chile" and an opportunity to "end a conflict that reaches 139 years back in time, both countries for the benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this issue as a political hedge.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
“The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to recover from the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said the country will never take down its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri gave his speech on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow through on the promises they made at a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State, appears to be resuming talks on nuclear weapons, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is "dreamers" to hold that the United States' continued business prayers and protests against a declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever bring down North Korea.
Washington will not accept the statement unless Pyongyang first takes clear action to take down its nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to meet again at another meeting.
However, there are strong doubts that Pyongyang is serious about taking down weapons that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris present the latest line of big headwear that will arrive in fashion stores near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or be completely hidden from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a variety of quirky oversized hats for their SS19 line in the fashion scene that captivated the jet team during the Paris Fashion Week.
Numerous images of extremely impractical hats have been published on Instagram this summer and these designers have had their innovative creations on display at fashion shows.
The main work by Valentino was a large light brown hat with wide stripes that resembled the feathers and hidden heads of the models.
From other oversized accessories, watermelons could be seen set with gemstones, cedar hats, and even pineapples, but these items are not designed to keep heat on the head.
Thom Browne also introduced a variety of strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had conjoined lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One mask resembled a diving device with a breathing pipe and glasses, while another resembled a melting ice cream in a bread mold.
If you want to be successful, luck is with you.
Fashion experts predict that the big hats could soon come on sale in fashion stores near you.
Large hats come a short distance on the heels of "La Bomba", a straw hat with over 60cm large shoulders that has adorned heads ranging from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fashion label behind the extremely impractical hat, which was seen on all social media, was the inspiration for another large accessory that appeared in the fashion scene – a beach bag made of straw that was almost as large as the swimwear-clad model that wore it.
The orange straw bag, with straw bars and a white leather handle, was the main feature of the La Riviera SS10 clothing line Jacquemus during the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, the famous people's stylist, said in an interview with FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags appear in fashion stores by next summer - as the designer has caused so much impact, it should be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are a necessity for global citizens
The private schools in Scotland are known for the outstanding performance of their students and it has continued in 2018 with new, impressive test results, which are still reinforced by individual and group success in sports, arts, music and other social practices.
These schools have up to 30,000 students across Scotland, with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) defending them, and they strive to provide their students and their parents with the best possible service.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further graduate studies, the careers they have chosen, and their status as global citizens.
As educators who can compile and teach custom curriculums, we see that new language continues to be a popular subject of study in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it touches his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, it touches his heart.”
This is an important reminder that we can’t just rely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's test results show us that languages are at the top of the list with the highest proportion of students achieving exams in private schools.
68 percent of students who learned a foreign language received a grade of A.
The data, collected from 74 schools within SCIS, showed that 72 percent of students received a grade of A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also received a grade of A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as an essential qualification that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
At the moment, languages, as an elective, are placed in the same position as science-related subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in private school curriculums and elsewhere.
A 2014 poll conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that for the reasons employers gave that hiring was difficult, 17 percent was due to a lack of people with language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future jobs.
Now that more and more jobs require proficiency in languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career people choose, they will have a real advantage in the future if they learn another language, but it is a skill that will last a lifetime.
The ability to interact directly with people from other countries will give a multi-talented person an automatic advantage over the competitors.
According to a poll conducted by YouGov on over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of them could not speak another language well enough to sustain conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-letter percentile, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for children today to immediately invest in language learning.
Multilingualism, especially in emerging markets, will give children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, the language they teach varies between schools.
A certain number of schools will focus on classic novelties, while others will teach languages that are considered to be most important to the UK in the run-up to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child's interest lies, they will always be able to choose from the languages of private schools with specially trained teachers.
Scottish private schools are committed to offering a learning environment, which will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be denied that at this time, in a global business environment, language continues to be essential for the country's future, and it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be viewed as "international skills in communication."
Private schools will continue to offer choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards is the chairman of the Scottish Private School Council.
LeBron plays his first game for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is soon over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday in the opening game of the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has not yet been determined in how many minutes he will play.
"It will be longer than a minute and shorter than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for the Lakers said on Twitter that James would likely play for a limited time.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked out in his plans for the Lakers' six-game schedule for the start of the season.
"In this period of my career, I don't have to play pre-season games to prepare myself," he said.
Timings for Trump's election rally in West Virginia and YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a number of election meetings, the first of which is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five scheduled meetings next week, where he will also stop at friendly locations, including in Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his election to a new Supreme Court Justice has been put on hold, Trump aims to build support for the next midterm election, because Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Senate when votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, and how can you watch him online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia online below through a live broadcast on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will discuss the trial of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, where tensions reigned over allegations of sexual harassment. The Senate vote to confirm him as a judge was put on hold for up to a week while the FBI investigates the allegations.
But Trump’s main goal is to help Republicans get better, but they’re expecting a tough election in November.
Therefore, the message from Trump's campaign was that these five meetings, which will be held next week, are aimed at "filling volunteers and supporters enthusiastically as Republicans try to protect and augment the majority they have in the Senate and in Congress," according to a Reuters news agency.
"Government of the Senate is so necessary for the president's plan that he will travel to as many states as possible as a busy campaign period is about to begin," an unnamed spokesman for Trump's campaign told Reuters.
The meeting tonight will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, and supporters are expected to come from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and that the Pittsburgh media will tell about him," according to the West Virginia Metro News Agency.
The meeting on Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia this month, but he won with over 40 percent difference in this state in 2016.
Trump wants to try to help Patrick Morrissey, a Republican candidate in West Virginia to the Senate, but he is bottom of the polls.
"It's not a good idea for Morrissey that the president needs to come and try to increase his popularity," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to a Reuters news agency.
The 2018 Ryder Cup: The U.S. team shows determination to keep hope alive for the individual race on Sunday
After three one-sided laps, the four-game, which was Saturday afternoon, could be exactly what was needed in this race for the Ryder Cup.
Fluctuations in success is a sports concept that has been invented and that players truly believe in, and never more than in competitions like this one.
Where would they say success is now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four points, so success is on our side now, I guess," said Jordan Spieth as he set off for today's race.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth said, believe they have a little wind in the sails and they can be hopeful about many things, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas playing together all day and each getting three points out of four.
Spieth has played well all the way away from the surface and leads by example.
The cheers increased as the ring progressed and he put down an important putt to earn all four points in the game after he and Thomas had been two points under after two games.
His putt, which guaranteed them victory in the game on the 15th hole, received a similar cheer, a cry of the kind that tells you that he believes the American team still has a hope of victory.
"You just have to dive deep and think about your own game," Spieth said.
That’s all these players can do right now.
18 holes to earn points.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but captivating European couple has won four games out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple to receive a schooling in the afternoon on Saturday, but they also managed to avoid a schooling on Saturday morning, in the afternoon on Friday, and on the nine-hole field on Friday morning.
That game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the loud crowd clearly shows that they are the pair that need to be defeated on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to seal the possible victory of the European team than Fleetwood or Molinari, as the sun sets over the Le Golf National field.
The best option would be for both to do it simultaneously on different holes.
It is still too early to talk about the European team’s victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went easy with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-game in the morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
Skolli and two doubles in the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they never managed to scratch themselves out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fours and fours are so exciting to watch in close proximity because of the relationships between the couples, their advice, the advice they don't give, and how a game plan can change in one fell swoop.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a considerable advantage before the final day, but this four-game round also showed that the American team has the fighting spirit that some had doubted it had, especially other Americans.
Europe with a 10-6 lead for the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good lead for the final day of the Ryder Cup after the four-ball and four-ball Saturday, with a lead of 10-6 against the United States.
Star-studded Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over Tiger Woods, who had difficulty, and have received four points on the Le Golf National field.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who would like to regain the trophy, which it lost on the Hazeltine field two years ago, showed a great advantage over the United States team in the four-ball game of the morning, winning 3-1.
The United States showed more resistance in the fours and won two games but failed to win the points difference.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to continue the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four consecutive points and he and Molinari, who were nicknamed "Molliwood" after a magnificent weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball game, they showed great team strength and won the downhill Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed his genius occasionally, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball and four-games, including seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning's four-ball game, came back to his partner, Henrik Stenson in the fours, winning 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are in first and third place on the list of the world's best golfers.
However, Europe did not fare well on this mild and gaussous day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner of major golf competitions, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the goal for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won by difficulty 2-1 against Jon Rahm of Spain and Ian Poulter in four-ball games and later came back, defeating Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the four-ball games after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team won a four-point difference at the start of an individual competition, though Furyk's team only needed a draw to continue the cup.
However, after being second best for two days, it seems that a counterattack on Sunday will overwhelm them.
North Korea says unilateral disarmament 'impossible' without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the U.N. on Saturday that continued trade bans only on their distrust of the U.S. and it would be impossible for the country to unilaterally dismantle its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures to show goodwill" over the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, taking down the nuclear testing area, and promising to stop the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not seen any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about the security of our country and under such circumstances it is impossible that we would unilaterally take down our nuclear weapons first."
Although Ri repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "staged" approach to nuclear disarmament in which North Korea would be rewarded for every step it took, his statement seemed special in that he did not unilaterally deny nuclear disarmament outright as P had previously done.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the acting U.S. President and North Korean leader, in Singapore on June 12, where Kim vowed to work on the "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump made promises to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a solution to formally end the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must abandon its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax a strict trade ban against North Korea.
"The United States is demanding that 'nuclear disarmament take place first' and increasing the pressure by using business prayer to achieve its goal, and even protesting the declaration to end the war," Ri said.
“There are only dreamers who don’t know anything about us to think that business prayer can bring us to our knees.
But the problem is that continuing business prayer increases our distrust."
Ri made no mention of plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader spoke about at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister spoke of three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, the leader of South Korea over the past five months, adding, "If the party to this nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea instead of the United States, this would not be a stand-off in the nuclear disarmament issue on the Korean peninsula."
Despite this, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from his speech last year when he said in the U.N. General Assembly that it was inevitable to target missiles from North Korea to the mainland of the United States after "the devilish president" Trump called Kim "a rocket man" in a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened to "destroy" North Korea, but this year he praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but said that much work was still to be done and that business prayers would have to continue until North Korea had spent all of its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeframe for what happened, saying, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that, "The Security Council's business begging must continue until complete nuclear disarmament has taken place and it has been confirmed."
The Security Council agreed to increase trade prayers with North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to close funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that success had been achieved, but only a few hours later North Korea condemned him for making "criminal demands."
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to take down a missile site and a nuclear facility if the United States took "corresponding action."
He said that Kim had told himself that the "corresponding actions" he sought were assurances of security promised by Trump in Singapore and actions towards normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students take classes in sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University has provided all students with more sleep in an effort to resist the growing tendency of students to wake up and learn all night with the help of caffeine tablets.
A study found that students at the best universities in the world often know little or nothing when it comes to the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and the Women's Hospital, designed the course, believing it to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea of doing the course after giving a lecture on the impact that sleep deprivation has on learning ability.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I being told this only now, in my senior year?’
She said that no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he toldTelegraph.
The course, held for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleeping habits help learning skills and performance in sports and even contribute to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the school's health services, said that the college had decided to introduce the course after finding out that students were extremely sleep-deprived over the week.
The course is an hour in length and includes a number of interactive projects.
One section features a picture of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sports can worsen with lack of sleep, along with the importance of good routine for sleep.
In the second part, participants are told how lack of sleep over the long term can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the school area with interactive symbols then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of the students.
But we feel they have a right to know this, just as one has a right to know of the health effects of smoking cigarettes," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture that favors those who stay awake and learn all night is still present, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate sleep of good quality should be a "secret weapon" for students to ward off stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said – even to avoid fattening, because lack of sleep increases the brain's call for food so that the body is persistent.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler put the course together, but he sat one of the professor's courses last year in his freshman year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a course for all students in the school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all master students to complete a similar course before they start studying at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider adjusting an alarm clock, reminding them to go to sleep, and to wake them up, and bearing in mind the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can confuse the body's internal clock and lead to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark from Menga shoots down Gerrard's men
The Rangers were still struggling on the outfield as Steven Gerrard's broken-up team had to settle for a 1-0 loss to Livingston, after a goal from Dolly Menga.
Ibrox's team wanted to achieve their first win on the outfield after their victory at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team only gave Gerrard's team their second loss in his 18 games as manager. The team is now eight points behind Hearts, who is in the top spot in the Ladbrokes Premiership league.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime and Rangers' team seemed to lack all the inspiration and was never likely to equalise.
The Rangers now drop to sixth, but Livingston goes up to third and is only trailing Hibernian in goal difference.
Rangers could get into further trouble after lineman Calum Spence had to get a promotion due to a head injury after some item was thrown at him from the field half of the visitors.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr away and made his debut in the Betfred Cup.
However, Holt stuck with the same Livi 11 setup that reached a level of Hearts last week and he would have been pleased with how well-trained his teammates rallied over the opposition.
The Rangers perhaps had more with the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the ball it caught.
They should have scored just two minutes after the start of the match when Menga's first transmission came Scott Pitman in front of Allan McGregor's goal, but he missed.
Long extra kicks from Keaghan Jacobs then ended up with Craig Halkett, whose defensive partner Alan Lithgow shot past the far bar.
The Rangers regained control of the game but seemed to live rather in hope than belief in their game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morales truly felt that he should have gotten a penalty when a quarter had passed of the game, when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's plea.
The Rangers only managed to take two shots to goal in the first half, but Liam Kelly, the former goaltender of Ibrox, did not have to have much to defend a shell from Lassana Coulibaly and an easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although an opportunity from Livi in the 34th minute would have come even though the other team had the upper hand, no one can deny that they deserved it, though only because of their perseverance.
The Rangers again failed to do anything from a long extra kick from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his calm and chose to send it to Menga who then scored easily.
Gerrard took his advice at half-time and sent Ryan Kent in instead of Coulibaly, and the switch affected almost immediately as the back guard came in, but Kelly reacted quickly and ran forward to close the shot.
However, Livingston continued to trick the visitors into playing just the type of game they enjoy playing, and Lithgow and Halkett each caught the long haul of another.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final minutes, but McGregor did well to deny Jacobs a chance before Lithgow ran to the finish line from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, Rangers' replacement, wanted a second penalty when he and Jacobs fell down, but Thomson dismissed it again.
The Man Who Invented the Geiger Counter
Here is a page from our calendar "Sunday Morning": 30 September, 1882, 136 years ago today and 'FORWARD... this is the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for studying and measuring radioactivity, and that invention eventually led to a device called a Geiger meter.
The Geiger meter has gained a firm place in the scientific world since, but was also popular in pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in unlikely roles as scientists:
Man: “What the hell is this?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger probe, used to find radioactive materials such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on you can hear the effects of the atoms due to the radioactivity in the stones."
Evans: "It's really crashing right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Your Immune System to ‘See’ Dangerous Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of the treatment
The treatment involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory
Then they can 'see' a protein, which is common in many cancer cells, and is then injected back into the patient
Experimental vaccines have shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months. The vaccine teaches immune cells to recognize dangerous cancer cells.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing them in a laboratory so that they can "see" a protein called HER2 found in many types of cancer. Then the cells are injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesday, Maryland, said: "Our findings suggest that the vaccine is extremely effective."
HER2 "allows various types of cancer to stop growing," including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancer, said Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method in which immune cells are removed from patients and they are 'known' to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a long monologue in support of Trump and wore a MAGA there hat after appearing on the SNL television show.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was bashed at the studio on Saturday Night Live after a lengthy speech in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great hat, he spoke long against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I’ve talked so often to white people who say, ‘How do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
If I were concerned about racism, I would have been deported from the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sting in which Hollywood star Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over allegations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the long-running West was not broadcast, the recording of it was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of West by releasing the recording.
West had also complained to the audience that he had received poor reception backstage due to his cap selection.
“I was put in the back seat.
They said to me, “Don’t go up there with this hat.”
They beat me up!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, according to news from the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see the deep hole?” and said that he would put on his superhero robe “because that means you can’t order me to do things. Do you want the world to progress?
“Try the love.”
His comments were met with baubles from the audience at least twice, and SNL's actors seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, and one presenter said to the paper, "There was a stone's silence in the studio."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his stage appearance as he sang the song I Love it, dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from Candace Turner, chairman of the conservative party TPUSA, who said on Twitter: "To one of the bravest souls: THANKS FOR VIEWING THE MOMENT."
But talk show host Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was simply being "himself and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his 'art') who I feel supports and propagates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
“We are too,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that now he is "the being that used to be known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion and must not forget the musical legend Prince the Hot, which changed its name to a symbol and later called himself the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder after knife attack at restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Tuesday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Kit Harington, the star of the Crown Games, criticizes venomous masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent adventure series from HBO, The Crown Games.
However, the actor, 31, has criticized the stereotype of the male hero, saying that such a role on screen means young boys often feel that they need to be hard on themselves to gain respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star from the Crown Games, the 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had "strong opinions" on how to deal with this issue.
"Personally, I think at the moment - what has gone wrong with masculinity?"
"What have we taught men in their upbringing, about the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that television is responsible in part for an increase in toxic masculinity, due to very masculine characters on television.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel like they must be a certain type of man?
I think that’s one of the most important questions of the time – how do we change this?
“It’s clear that something is wrong with young people.”
He also admitted in the interview that he would not play in any other Cruelty show after the series match next summer, saying that he had been given "enough of battlefields and horses."
Starting in November, Kit will play in a remake of True West, a film by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother who is a robber.
The actor recently said that the best thing about having played in the Crown Games was having met his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife on these shows, so they kind of gave me my future family and my life after that," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Jon Snow who Kit starred in these Emmy Award-winning episodes.
The couple married in June 2018, on the land of Lesliar's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces 14% increase in new infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people infected with the HIV virus or with AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
About 40,000 new infections were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new infections were transmitted through sex, which is a change from what was before.
In the past, the HIV virus spread rapidly in some parts of China due to the donation of contaminated blood.
On the other hand, the number of people infected by the HIV virus in this way has dropped to almost zero, as Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people infected with the HIV virus or AIDS has increased by 100,000 from year to year.
HIV infection caused by sex is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but major discrimination against LGBT people is still reportedly occurring.
Due to conservative values in the country, research has estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry a woman.
Many infections occur as a result of inadequate contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised access to HIV drugs for everyone as part of a plan to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked data from Republican senators, criticizing "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, a congresswoman, denied on Saturday allegations that one of her employees had published the personal information of three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said that these claims came from "super-right" extremists and websites.
"Lies, lies and more horrible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published reportedly included addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday from an unknown party on Capitol Hill during questioning at the Senate on Brett Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court justice, over allegations of sexual harassment.
The leak came sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said the IP addresses identifying the source of the information were linked to Waters' office and disclosed information about one of her employees, according to information from Capitol Hill.
"This unsubstantiated accusation is absolutely wrong and a pure lie," Waters continued.
“My employee – whose personal data and security are now compromised by these false allegations – was in no way responsible for this information leak.
This unsubstantiated accusation is absolutely wrong and a pure lie."
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including by Ara Fleischer, a former White House press officer.
"This denial is full of anger," Fleischer wrote.
“It shows that she doesn’t have the guts to sit down.
When someone is accused without a reason, do not react with anger.
There can be no opposition.
You can’t ask the reasons for the accusation.
It needs to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics said appeared to be too angry at Thursday's trial.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate against Waters in the midterm elections, also said his opinion on Twitter.
"Big deal if true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had informed "appropriate authorities and law enforcement officials of these false claims.
"We will ensure that the guilty are found," she continued, "and that they are held accountable for all the actions that are damaging and dangerous to all of my employees."
Movie review for Johnny English Strikes again - spy comedy with Rowan Atkinson turns out to be powerless
It has become a habit now to look for Brexit references in all new films involving the UK, and it seems to apply in this revival of the Johnny English comedy series - which started in 2003 with the film Johnny English and just woke up back to life in 2011 with the film Johnny English Reborn.
Do you think this is going to be a new opportunity for our country?
Whether it is or not, Johnny English has been given a new license for the second time to mess everything up - his name shows above all that he is a creation designed for an exhibition in countries other than English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the more witty intelligence officer who pretends to have a captivating personality but is a bit of a mix of Clouseau, a dass of Mr. Bean and a bit of a eraser of the man who played one note for the song Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
He is also originally based on the tourist and mysterious world citizen that Atkinsons once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, where he left everything in chaos.
There are one or two good scenes in this latest Johnny English film.
I enjoyed seeing Johnny English walking to a helicopter wearing a medieval coat, and the helipads were to be worn in his helmet.
Atkinson clearly demonstrates his comedy skills, but the humor seems rather powerless and strangely superficial, especially already "serious" films such as James Bond and the Mission Impossible films also offer no hesitation.
The joke seems more meant for children than adults, and I felt the adventures that Johnny English encountered were not as imaginative and focused as Atkinson's silent jokes in Mr Bean's guise.
One of the main reasons for the film is that the UK is in big trouble.
A computer hacker has managed to break into Britain's secret intelligence network and establish the identity of all British spies, much to the dismay of the spy on duty - but there Kevin Eldon unfortunately finds himself in too small a role.
This is the final straw for the Prime Minister, who is a haughty and controversial character and already in a state of turmoil due to extreme political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with her role as a character to be reminded of Theresa May, but the script is not up to many fishes for her.
Her advisors tell her that all active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who had already been set in a sacred stone.
And that's where Johnny English himself comes in, now a principal at some fancy school, but also provides a secret lesson on how to be a spy: here are some funny jokes that English offers at a spy school reminiscent of the movie School of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and there meets Bough, his former long-suffering partner, whom Ben Miller plays again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submariner, but in that energetic role Vicki Pepperdine doesn't quite get to let her light shine.
The spy pig who fucks up everything in her Majesty's service is now back in the gear and meets the high-powered Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is intrigued by the magic of the fascinating billionaire within the tech sector, who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problem: it's the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their disastrous journey: they set fire to a fine French restaurant disguised as serving, they cause a wreck as they smuggle themselves into Volta's luxury yacht, and English turns everything upside down when he tries to use virtual reality glasses to study the interior of Volta's house.
There is nothing to spare in that final scene, but although the film is lively and energetic, it does contain some of the children's material in it as a whole.
Mediocre material.
And just like the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really qualifies his talents?
The Labour Party denies that it is making a plan for a four-day working week for the UK, with the same pay as for a five-day week.
The Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is now considering a radical plan that would allow Britain to work for four days a week, but be paid for five.
Reportedly, the party wants corporate executives to make use of the savings generated from the revolution in artificial intelligence, and let employees benefit by getting one extra day off.
Then employees could enjoy a three-day long weekend, without lowering their pay.
Sources say the idea would "fit" with the party's economic plan and its policy of improving workers' interests.
Trades Union Congress has supported the shortening of the working week for four days, as a way for workers to take advantage of changes in the economy.
A senior Labour Party official told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is scheduled for the end of the year.
"The change will not be overnight, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits with the party's approach to transforming the economy for the benefit of workers and with the party's overall industrial policy."
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support this idea, but the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its 2017 election campaign.
However, the goal is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "Four days of work week is not on the party's policy paper and the party is not considering introducing it."
John McDonnell, Secretary of the Department of Commerce used the Labour Party conference last week to outline his ideas for a social revolution within the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "unknown CEOs" and "profit collectors" of supply companies.
The Shadow Minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not get their entire share back as the Labour Party government could be "deprived" of alleged wrongdoing.
He has also confirmed plans to put workers on corporate governance committees and create a joint ownership fund to leave 10 percent of private company assets to their employees, who could receive a 500-pound profit from them annually in their pocket.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say '60 minutes' whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could get them to change their minds
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a week-long delay in a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court, raising the question of whether her findings could cause Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be shown on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a reporter on the "60 Minutes" show, asked Republicans and Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said when the trial started, I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the allegations were made and asked, “Did you do this?”
He was determined, steadfast, unambiguous."
Graham's vote, however, seems unchangeable.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take an incredible accusation to change that," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but this I know: Brett firmly denied it," Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone she named couldn’t confirm it.
This case is 36 years old.
I don’t think anything new will change.”
What is the International Civil Rights Day and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be held on Saturday in New York. It is an annual music event where a series of major stars will appear and with similar impact; ending poverty worldwide.
This is the seventh year that the International Civil Festival is being held and tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park, not only to listen to music from Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, among others, but also to draw attention to the festival's real goal of ending poverty by 2030.
The International Civil Rights Day, first held in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project, an international fighting organization that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of those fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (except for those who want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers needed to complete various tasks, or ‘activities', such as doing volunteer work, sending emails to one of the world's leaders, making phone calls, or using other valid ways to help draw attention to their goal of getting a tie.
But how much progress has the festival made, now that there are 12 years left to reach the goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with free concerts a real way to convince people to call for action, or is this just one so-called 'click action' - where people feel they are doing something that matters by signing a demand list online or sending a message on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that as of 2011, it has recorded over 19 million "actions" from its supporters, to call for a variety of different goals.
It says these actions helped get world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to over $35 billion that will affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements due to its actions, of which at least $10 billion has been invested or raised.
The group estimates that the money raised so far has directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main commitments comes from The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based company of investors and executives working to "help children enjoy themselves to the full," promising to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving 4,700 messages on Twitter from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, sponsors, governments around the world and international citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a thing of the past,” Tracey Ullmann, representative of The Power of Nutrition, told an audience at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5,000 calls were sent for Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
In the list of frequently asked questions on the group's website, one of the questions is: "Why do you think you can end a painful poverty?"
Global citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult task – sometimes we will fail all the time.
But, we will reach our goal, just like movements that fought for the rights of citizens and the abolition of racial segregation before us, for we are stronger together.
Among those performing at the event this year are Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe. The event will be held in New York and the presenters are Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy as 'block' to block Russia's energy exports, interior minister says
"If necessary," Washington could use the Navy to prevent energy in Russia from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, says U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, according to a report from the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's aid to Syria, especially as the country is working at the invitation of the legitimate government there, was a pretext for exploring new markets.
“I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is that they want to do business with energy like in Eastern Europe and its southern parts,” he said.
And, according to the official announcement, there are ways and means to counter it.
"The United States can use the Navy to ensure that shipping routes are open and to form a barrier, if necessary, to ensure that energy from them does not enter the market," he said.
Zinke addressed a guest meeting offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity group calling itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He went on and compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying it was more or less the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the exploitation of energy sources and the substitution of them for others," he said, saying Russia has only one card in its sleeve with an economy that would depend on fossil fuels.
The statements come as a result of Trump's administration wanting to increase its exports of natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, public officials in Trump's administration, including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to cancel participation in the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 project to lay a new energy pipeline, which Trump says would make Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly claimed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 energy pipeline, which will double the transport capacity of the current pipeline to 110 billion cubic feet, is a purely economic project.
Russia says Washington's strong opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy should not be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” said Russia’s energy minister, Aleksandr Novak, after a meeting with U.S. energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States has been criticized by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and a bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I am very unhappy that an external state is interfering with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, chairman of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting recently held with Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, and Vladimir Putin, President of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider seriously" to run for the presidency in 2020, she says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "consider seriously" running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that she would consider inviting herself to a civic meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our government, and then we also need a woman as leader," she said.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump at the meeting, saying that he was "taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been oblivious to his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his appointed Supreme Court Justice.
On Friday, Warren said on Twitter that "of course we have to have the FBI investigate the matter before the vote goes ahead."
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that the majority of voters in Warren's state do not think it should run for office in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not volunteer, according to a poll published by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent said they supported her proposal.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's campaign, with 38 percent saying they supported his possible campaign and 48 percent saying they were opposed.
Other popular Democrats discussed for a possible 2020 presidential run were Joe Biden, former vice president, and Bernie Sanders, a senator from Vermont.
Biden said he will make an official decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin Talks About Track Palin's Shock Stress Disorder at Donald Trump's Election Meeting
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"My son is going through a lot of trouble after coming back, I feel with other families who are affected by trauma stress disorder and the mental wounds that our soldiers return home with," she told an audience at an election rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war soldiers "come back a little differently, they are hardened and wonder if any respect is being paid for what their fellow military and air force members and other military departments have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, for attempting to block the announcement of domestic violence and for gun violence under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and Washington D.C. support challenge to new asylum-seeking policies
Eighteen states and the City of Washington are supporting a legal challenge to the U.S.'s new policy of denying asylum to victims fleeing gang or household violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the city filed a court report on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker protesting the policy, according to a report from NBC News.
The full name of the prosecution in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her spouse "and his violent sons who were gang members," used her violence, but U.S. government officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The attorneys who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries where problems related to gangs and domestic violence are increasing. The number of asylum seekers to the United States comes from these countries.
The new asylum-seeking policy reverses a ruling by the Immigration Appeals Commission in 2014 to allow unregistered migrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignored more decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that a decision be made on all asylum applications based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this rule," said the court report.
Lawyers further stated in the report that the policy that denied immigrants entry was detrimental to the U.S. economy, and argued that immigrants were more likely to set up businesses and "provide important labor."
Jeff Sessions, Attorney General ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Those who leave their home country because of persecution based on race, religion, ethnicity or membership of a particular social group or political opinion can apply for asylum," Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
Healthcare was never meant to solve all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people deal with every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operations in a race to find survivors in Palu, as the number of dead doubles
Things are becoming more and more difficult for those who survive.
"There's a lot of excitement in the air," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her sick son in the relief center in the city of Palu.
“The ambulances are always here.
There’s not a lot of clean water.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes and searching their watershed possessions in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals are overcrowded and damaged after the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who broke their backs and shoulders, were located outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were favored outdoors due to the continuing forceful aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted how he found the earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I'm pushing up against the wall ruins, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, saying that his family had been in town to go to a wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of 'persecution' with 'advertising'
A week after an official China newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper to discuss mutual benefits in trade between the two countries, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of exploiting U.S. media to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday spoke about the Chinese newspaper's advertisement in the Des Moines Register - which is the best-selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. election that will be on November 6. China denies this accusation.
Trump's accusation that Beijing wanted to meddle in the U.S. congressional elections marked what official U.S. representatives said Reuters news agency was a new stage in an expanding campaign from Washington to apply China pressure.
While it is natural for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are engaged in a intensifying trade war, with new tariffs on both countries' imports.
Chinese and American experts say that China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to harm expatriates in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, whose state exports a lot of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad said in his inaugural opinion piece in the Des Moines Register Sunday that "China is now stepping up its persecution by publishing propaganda ads in our own free media."
"In spreading its propaganda, the government of China is taking advantage of the beloved tradition of freedom of speech in the United States and our free media by publishing a codified advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad said in his article.
"On the other hand, few protestors can be found in newspaper booths on Beijing's streets, and no true reflection can be found on the different views that the Chinese might have on China's worrying economic policies, as the media is stuck under the heel of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the biggest news papers in China escaped the offer to publish" his article, but he did not state which paper it was.
Experts warn that Republicans are making female voters disapprove of them for the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned of negative reactions, especially from women, in the next midterm elections, because many Republicans have supported and defended Brett Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court justice, who has faced allegations of sexual harassment.
Very strong feelings have been around this issue and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they wanted to start voting.
"These things can't be backed up," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Jeff Flake, a Republican senator in Arizona,'s last-minute call for an FBI investigation was enough to calm angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday, they won't forget tomorrow and not November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and spokeswoman for the liberal group MoveOn, told reporters.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is approaching!" as they protested in the Senate corridors when the Republicans who headed the ruling committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and enthusiasm of voters will rise out of all power," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news website.
“People will say that the interest has already been great and that’s true.
But he could be bigger, especially with female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who dislike the president, but rarely vote."
Analysts predicted a setback if Republicans pressed for Kavanaugh's confirmation, even before Ford's testimony, where she described her allegations of sexual harassment from him.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Still, a former member of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"The issue isn't just about the committee's vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be left on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they've treated it," Guy Cecil, chairman of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news station.
However, Americans seem to disagree who should believe after testimony from both Ford and Kavanaugh, and a narrow majority support the latter.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or probably believed the testimony from Ford, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said they believed Kavanaugh likely or certainly lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the call from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and from at least one other woman, Deborah Ramirez, according to a report from the Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, saying that Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says that Kavanaugh carried her genitals in front of her when they were both at a party studying at Yale University in the 1990s.
The Man Who Invented the Internet Has Plans to Start a New Internet to Fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the internet, is going to set up a seed company to fight Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the Solid, open platform Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access what information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that the intent behind Inrupt was "world domination."
“We have to do it now,” he said of the company.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses technology from Solid to enable people to create their own "personal data store online" or POD.
It includes a list of contacts, a to-do list, a calendar, a music collection, and other personal and work-related devices.
It is similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all being present in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access any information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment using data."
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea of Inrupt is that the company provides the inputs, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers hired as contractors to work on the project, and a group of developers on a volunteer basis.
As of this week, technology developers around the world could create their own independent applications using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team should not be in talks with "Facebook and Google about whether or not to initiate a complete change that would put their current business model on its head overnight.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published Saturday on Medium that Inrupt had it "a goal of creating energy in business and ecosystems that helps protect the honesty and quality of the new site based on Solid."
Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even while establishing Inrupt.
"I'm full of optimism for the next season of the network," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The vicar and holder of the Victoria Cross from World War I honored
The only English priest to be honored with the Victoria Cross in World War I as a soldier has been hailed in his hometown 100 years later.
Reverend Bernard Vann, who held the rank of lieutenant colonel in the army, received the cross on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and he was never told that he had been awarded the British Army's highest honour.
His two great-grandsons unveiled a monument to him in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was "wonderfully symbolic" that the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years from his grandfather's honorific.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his troops across the Canal de Saint-Quentin canal "through extremely thick fog and under heavy fire from cannons and machine guns."
Later he ran to the firing line and with "great courage" he led the line forward before attacking a cannon of his own and overpowering three soldiers.
A defeated lieutenant colonel was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's heroics were "something I could never do, but something that makes you humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a flower wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt it "a great honour to participate in the parade" and added that "the virtues of a true hero are demonstrated by the support that so many show."
MMA fans woke up all night to watch Bellator 206, got instead to see Gurru pig
Just imagine, having woken up all night to see the overcrowded Bellator 206, just to be denied seeing the main event.
The program featured 13 fights from San Jose, six of which were on the main schedule and they were broadcast live throughout the night in the UK on the Channel 5 channel.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British audiences received a surprise appearance as the broadcast turned into a Gurru pig.
Some were unhappy after waking up all night to watch the battle.
One fan on Twitter described the changes to the children's material as "some kind of sick joke."
"According to official rules, the material was not suitable for the audience at six o'clock in the morning so they had to switch to children's material," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications for Bellator, when asked out on the broadcast.
"Gurra pig, yes."
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator said they would review their schedules and take viewers in the UK into account in the future.
"I think when I think about the replay that we could probably sort this out," Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday there, and we can’t solve this until Sunday at our time, which is Monday at theirs.
But we are working on this.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, numerous text messages were sent back and forth, and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to fix this, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that wasn’t the case, it was a public issue.
I promise this won’t happen next time.
We limit the night to five fights instead of six, as usual, but we tried too much and we outdid ourselves.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inadequate' due to sexual orientation
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he felt a lack of empathy towards other people in his upbringing because of his sexuality, but that it encouraged him to succeed.
The 24-year-old Daley said he did not realize that "he was different from others" until he went to high school."
On the Desert Island Discs radio show on the Radio 4 channel, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said that he spoke about gay rights to give others a "hope."
He also said that his parenting role has diminished his interest in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular factor manager, has taken several months off due to illness.
Daley faced an outsider in Laverne's first episode, saying that he felt he was a "lesser man" than everyone else when he was a child because "it wasn't accepted in society to be liked by both boys and girls."
He said: “Until today, these feelings of inferiority and differentness have given me the strength and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when he finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has been heavily promoted as an LGBT supporter and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more nations to legalise homosexuality.
He said he was being heard because he felt lucky to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to give 'hope' to others.
The world champion triple said that it had "surprised him" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, last year but said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When a man goes through so much at a young age" - but he participated in his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was difficult to find peers who had experienced similar success and hardship.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "all life views" had been suppressed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
“You know, there are more important things than the gold medal at the Olympics.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son is baptised in the head of Robert, his father who died in 2011, aged 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had received their tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't live long enough to sit in the front row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until his breathing stopped and he was left that I finally admitted he wasn't invincible," he said.
The next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that I had been dreaming about this all my life, dipping myself in front of an audience at home at the Olympics. It doesn’t feel better,” he said.
It was also inspired by the choice of the first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had inspired him for the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m. local time.
Mickelson in bad shape and left on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will hit a record Sunday as he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to find his old beats again so that the record is not surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who plays in the race for the 12th time, which is a record, was left on the bench after captain Jim Furyk's decision for the four-ball and four-game games on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has been so many times before for the United States, the day of the five-time champion alternates between being a cheerleader and practicing the paces of play on the field in hopes of correcting what he amorizes.
Mickelson, 48 years old, was never the one who fired a direct hit with a dragster, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National golf course, as long-distance skirmishes often penalize for bad shots.
And not only is the golf course a big challenge in itself, but Mickelson has to compete against Frances Molinari, winner of the British Open, in the ninth game on Sunday. Molinari is with rookie Tommy Fleetwood on the team and together they have won all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points under when they take the first game out of 12 singles games, get a good start, Mickelson's game could make a big difference.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he could hardly say much else.
"He completely understood the role he had today, patted me on the back and took care of me and said he'll be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He's in the hall of fame and he's been such a great remedy for the teams in the past and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play two games.
I saw more for myself, but that’s how it ended, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in a number of games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never reached quite as high as other achievements on his record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, but Furyk said his presence had a definite unclear effect on the team.
"He's funny, he's ironic, he's witty, he likes to make fun of people and it's great to have him in the team room," he explained.
“I think the younger players enjoyed playing him too this week, and it was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just the game of golf."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe knows that a great advantage can disappear quickly
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a good advantage for the last day of the individual race in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
The Dan first played in a game in Valderrama in 1997, where side under captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but just managed to squeeze out the win at the end with the smallest possible score difference, with a 141–2-131–2 win.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a lot of advantage in Valderrama, we had a lot of advantage in Brookline where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, but just right,” said Bjorn, who is seen here in the photo, after watching the 2018 season win 5-3 both on Friday and Saturday and reach the lead of 10th place.
The story will show me and everyone on the team that it’s not over.
We'll all go tomorrow.
Let's go and do everything right.
This is not finished until all the levels are on the table.
We have our goal and it is trying to win this trophy, we focus on that
I've always said this, I'm focused on the 12 players in our team, but we're very aware of our opponent in the other team - the best golfer in the world."
Bjorn was delighted with the way his players had performed on a difficult pitch, adding: “I never get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, it’s the performance of the individuals that matters, and that’s another thing.
It’s great to play with a partner when everything is going well, but when you play alone, you’re tested on every man’s talent as a golfer.
It’s the message that needs to be sent to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now a man leaves his partner behind and he also has to play his best game himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, will strive for his players to perform better in individual games rather than with partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both sides of this major transition on the last day, but he was victorious with his team at Brookline but ended up losing when Europe performed the "miracle in Medinah."
"I remember every fucking word," he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had encouraged his players for the last day.
“We need to play 12 important games tomorrow but you want to start fast like Brookline and Medinah.
When the screed is closer to building up, it creates a lot of pressure on the games that are in the middle.
We put our players in order and let them play as we think they will do best tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defence and plays against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half of the games.
"I chose these players in this order because I think they cover all the way through," Bjorn said of his choice of players in the individual competition.
Germany's new warship delayed yet again
The latest warships of the German Navy should have been built in 2014 to replace old warships from the Cold War period, but it will not be ready until the first of next year due to broken systems and ever-increasing costs, according to news in the area.
The building of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the lead ship of the brand new warships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to sources from a military spokesman who spoke to Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship had been due to be taken into service by the Navy in 2014, but serious problems after delivery plagued the project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to be replaced by the Bremen-class warships, which have come of age.
They should be equipped with a more powerful cannon, multiple anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and hiding techniques such as reduced radar, infrared, and sound signals.
Other important features are a longer period of use - it should be possible to use the latest ships for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, constant delays mean that these warships of the latest type – which are said to allow Germany to show its strength at sea – will be already obsolete when they are finally taken into use, says Die Zeit.
The F125 warship came to the news last year when the German army officially refused to take over the fleet, returning it to the Blohm & Voss slip in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the split, but German media spoke of many women seriously "lack of software and hardware" that rendered the warship useless if sent to war.
Deficiencies in software were particularly important because a Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warship will be piloted by a crew of 120, which is half the size of a Bremen-class warship.
It was also found that the ship was far too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to make additions to it in the future.
The 7,000-ton ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice the weight of a similar class ship used by the Germans in World War II.
Aside from hardware flaws, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - is starting to cause problems.
It is said to have reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), but was originally supposed to be 2.2 billion euros.
Problems facing the latest ships are particularly important in light of the warnings that German naval superiority is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy was actually becoming "a hitch with a functioning ship."
The representative said that the problem had subsided over time, for older ships were decommissioned but no ships came in their place.
He lamented that none of the orders of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be adopted by the Navy.
The National Trust for the Conservation of Nature spies on the secret life of the bats
A new study, conducted on land in the Scottish Highlands, aims to find out how bats use the landscape when they hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation efforts in the future.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will monitor different species of bats in the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations around the area to monitor the behavior of the bats over the period.
NHS staff and volunteers will also go on patrols with handheld sensors.
Experts will audio-detect all recordings to find out the frequency of the calls, which the bats emit, and what species do what.
Maps of habitats and reports will then be published to create an accurate picture of their behaviour on a geographical scale.
Rob Dewar, a wildlife conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results reveal what kind of habitats are most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, e.g. by creating meadows and how best to maintain woodland for bats and other related species.
Bats have declined significantly in the last century in Scotland and throughout the UK.
They are at risk from construction and development projects that affect their nests and reduce habitat.
Windmills and lights can also pose risks, including flypaper and certain building materials treatments, as well as attacks from household pets.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, their ears are much more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey, because they are used to fishing at night.
They used advanced echo detection technology to find insects and objects that are on their flight path.
NTS, responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
The organization employs ten experts, who perform regular inspections, nest inspections, and sometimes rescue operations.
The association has even established Scotland's first and only batting grounds at the Threave ranch in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the manager of the ranch, says he is the perfect area for them.
"The area here at Threave is great for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of grown trees and lots of good habitats.
But there is still a lot of ignorance about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive."
He stressed the importance of checking with bats before any maintenance is carried out on a dwelling, as the possible unintentional destruction of one nest can kill up to 400 female bats and juveniles and completely destroy all bats in the area.
Bats are protected and it is forbidden to kill them, harass or disturb, or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative with the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot of unlearned bats and we don't know how well many of their species are doing."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape as lawyers prepare lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called allegations against him of rape "fake news" and says that people want to "get their attention" by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is reported to have paid her $375,000 afterwards for silencing the incident, according to a report by Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, said in an Instagram Live video with his 142 million followers that they were "fake news."
“No, no, no, no.
What was said today is fake news," said the world champion five times to the camera.
“These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an unacceptable disclosure of suspicions relating to privacy," according to a Reuters news agency.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said Ronaldo would demand compensation for "a misdemeanor of the same amount as the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in the rectum, according to documents filed before the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident, telling her he was a "99 percent good man" who fell into temptation due to the "1 percent."
The documents allege that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex but that it was with the consent of both.
Mayorga claims that she went to the police and had pictures taken of her injuries in hospital, but finally agreed to a plea outside the courtroom because she was "deadly afraid of retaliation" and was concerned about becoming "degraded publicly."
She now says she wants to cancel the pleas because she is still in shock after an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to going to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape was supposed to have taken place, and this summer he went over to Italian giant Juve with a 100 million euro deal.
Brexit: Britain would 'regret forever' losing automakers
Britain would "regret forever" if it lost its position as an international leader among automakers after Brexit, says Minister for Trade Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily cease production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that the impact from delaying the border if Brexit without a deal would become a reality would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis automobiles, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“My view is that if the UK leaves the EU by the end of March, we will see production facilities in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have expressed concerns about exiting the EU without approval on how to conduct cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns stem from what automakers say are supply chain risks if a no-deal Brexit becomes a reality.
Toyota's production line is based on a 'last minute' reception, with parts being delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars produced by order.
If the UK withdraws from the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruptions to the border that the industry believes could lead to delays and lack of components.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day stock in its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and so production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for a future relationship with the EU was aimed specifically at preventing these views at the border."
"We have to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that allows us to enjoy not just success in the modern world, but as an opportunity that we can take advantage of," he said on a BBC Radio 4 radio show.
“The evidence, not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers as well, shows that we need to be able to continue with very successful pipelines.
Toyota could not say how long their production would stop, but warned that in the long run, increased costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a confidant of the union in the factory, said that his colleagues were increasingly concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a detailed and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Meetings between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
The White House declared on Sunday that an important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "dead by one week" now the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor, who investigates Russian conflicts in elections, links between Trump's aides and Russia, and possible obstacles to the progress of justice at the hands of the president.
For weeks, rumors have been circulating in Washington as to whether Trump will fire an assistant attorney general, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a recording device to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of overturning the president using the 25th Amendment to the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
But last Monday, he visited the White House, among other news that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, at which time he was with the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "preferably doesn't" want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed so that he was not at the same time as an audience with the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who has sued him for sexual harassment, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sander, Trump's media representative, was on the Fox News Sunday show.
When asked about Rosenstein, she said: “There is no date set for him, it could be this week. I think it is possible that he will be suspended for another week because of everything else that is going on at the Supreme Court.
But we will see and it is always my pleasure to inform the media."
Some reporters disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The show's host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not due to dissatisfaction with television reporters having "visuality," however she said, "I don't disagree with the fact that they have virtuality."
She then gave evidence that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president answers more media questions than any other president has ever done before," she said, without referring to sources: "We've reviewed these numbers."
Media conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the media has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We try to do a lot of that and you’ve seen us do a lot of that over the last few weeks and that will replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or media meetings with other leaders who visit him.
Media meetings with him alone are rare.
The president perhaps showed its reason in New York this week, when he showed off restraints and at times strange behavior in front of a group of reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU health workers in Scotland over concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working within the health system in Scotland (NHS Scotland) to express the nation's gratitude and wish it would continue to work after Brexit has passed.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter in less than six months until the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has already promised to meet the costs of work permit applications for EU citizens working within the public service sector.
Ms. Freeman wrote in her letter: “Over the summer, talks between the UK and the EU over the dismissal have continued and are expected to take place in the autumn.
The British government has also been working on preparations if possible not out of a deal.
I know this must be a great time for all of you.
That is why I want to reiterate how much I value the work of the entire staff, no matter what their nationality is.
Partners from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the functioning of healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is indeed your home and we would very much like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a lineman for the Tennessee State Tigers had to undergo emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores team on Saturday, according to a report from Mike Organ, a Tennessean journalist.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State told reporters that the injury had occurred shortly before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and fell down there," Reed said.
Trainers and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before being placed on a stretcher and carried out for further inspection.
A Tennessee State representative told WSMV's Nashville radio operator, Tennesse, that Abercrombie had had surgery at the Vanderbilt hospital.
Harris added that there was "no information on the type or severity of the injury yet" and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, who is in his senior year of school, plays his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five tackles in total on Saturday before leaving, which raised his total number of tackles to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when buying real estate in the UK. The surplus will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Conservative Party plan
The action will nullify Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
Increased stamp fees will be charged to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The federal government plans to raise 120 million pounds a year - to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when buying real estate in the UK. The surplus will be used to help the homeless. Theresa May will announce this today.
The operation will be seen as an attempt to nullify Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by promising housing at affordable prices and further taxing high-income people.
Individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK will have to pay higher stamp duty, and the surplus will go into government action to help the homeless.
The increase - which is in addition to the current stamp fees, including the increase imposed two years ago on second homes and real estate purchases for rent - could be up to three percent.
The government estimates that the increase will raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new buildings in London are purchased by foreign parties, but this causes price increases and makes those who want to buy real estate for the first time more difficult to enter the market.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" due to the number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged May to cancel quotas on homes at affordable prices to fix Britain's "housing shame".
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of perceived improvements to housing, including rent control and the end of expropriation from rent-free housing.
He also wants to give more power to build a new home.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate myself to the restoration of the British dream in my first period – that every new generation should enjoy a better quality of life.
And that includes fixing our worthless real estate market.
The doors of Britain will always be open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it may not be right that it is as easy for foreign entities as for companies headquartered abroad to buy homes and for diligent British nationals.
For many, the dream of their own home has become far too distant, and the shame that comes with homelessness is still too real."
Jack Ross: 'My main goal is to coach Scotland'
Jack Ross, Sunderland's coach, says it is his "main goal" to become Scotland's coach at some point.
This 42-year-old Scotsman now enjoys the challenge of breathing new life into the North-East club, which now sits third in the First Division, three points from the top.
He moved to Sunderland this summer after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Premier League in the final season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was injured on my knee and thus it was finished," said Ross in an interview with Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden often with my dad as a child, and there’s always something that’s pulled me back.
But that opportunity would only come if I manage well to coach a league team."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's coaches include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic club coach said he felt no fear of following in the footsteps of such famous names at such a large club, but he had previously turned down coaching positions at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"As it is, I will measure my success by thinking, 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
This club undoubtedly has a home in the Premier League due to its structure and facilities," he said.
"It's not an easy job to get him there, but I would probably only consider myself successful here if I get the club back up there."
Ross has only three years of experience, as a coach, after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of a coaching staff for Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from falling into the third division, and converted St Mirren, who was at the time falling through the division, into a league champion the following season.
Ross claims to be more confident now than he ever was during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real breakthrough," he says of the season when he became Alloa's coach.
“I really believed that the coaching job suited me, even more so than playing.
It sounds strange, because I went well, I had a decent income from it and enjoyed a mediocre success.
But change can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot every week.
I still go through it in terms of stress and pressure from the job, but the coaching job just seems right for me.
I always wanted to train and now I do, I've never felt better about myself in all my adult years."

The best time for beer is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays, according to a poll
This summer's heat wave has proven profitable for British bars that have a hard time, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
Sales at pubs and bars increased 2.7 percent in July, but sales at restaurants dropped 4.8 percent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, of the business consulting firm CGA, who compiled the figures, said: “The continued sunshine and unexpected success of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the month of June, when bar sales increased by 2.8 percent, except for what restaurants sold even less.
The sale fell by 1.8 percent at restaurants in June and worsened again in July.
Poppies and bars, aimed mainly at drinks sales, fared best with more upswing while restaurants went downhill.
People who sold food also had difficulty in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems like people just want to go out and drink.
Sales of drinks at pubs and bars increased 6.6 percent by the month, while food sales decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, from RSM, said: “These results are a continuation of the swing we’ve seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of important social or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales in non-domestic markets.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still experiencing difficulties, although a sales reduction of 4.8 percent between months is particularly painful on top of continuing pressures caused by costs.
This long and hot summer could hardly come at a worse time for dining places and only time will reveal whether the temperate temperatures, as we have had in August, will improve the situation."
The total growth in sales at pubs and restaurants, including at newly opened locations, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the pace of openings.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the monitoring company with sales in the British pub-bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyzes data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of 9 billion pounds and is the industry benchmark for the sector.
One in five children have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents
One in five children, as young as 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to the results of a survey.
A poll of 20,000 students showed an increase in 'fake Insta' pages
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students say they have a "primary" account that they show to parents
One in five children, as young as 11 years old, create secret accounts on social media that they keep a secret from adults.
A poll of 20,000 students showed a large increase in "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to the Instagram website.
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "primary" account to show parents, as well as having secret accounts.
One mother, who fell on her 13-year-old daughter's secret website, found a teenager who encouraged others to "rape me."
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Council of Private Schools Commissioners (HMC), showed that 40 percent of children aged 11-18 had two accounts, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: "It's a concern that so many teenagers are tempted to create an area online where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voice of athletes' on the Scottish Athletics Sports Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the board's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful free sportswoman and Ian Beattie, the committee's chairman said the nomination was a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her extensive experience in the international arena over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect within sports communities in Scotland, the UK and internationally, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would make a lot of money getting her on the committee," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am very interested in speaking on behalf of athletes and hope that I can contribute and help lead the sport forward in Scotland."
The American, who won among the ananr 200 metres and 400 metres races at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, but has a total of four Olympic golds, and is now a regular guest at the BBC, was paralysed after suffering a transient hemorrhage.
He wrote on Twitter: “One month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would tell if I recovered and then to what extent.
It’s been a hard work but I fully recovered, learned to walk again and do sports exercises today!
Thank you for your encouragement!”
Breast pump advertisement, comparing mothers to cows, causes online disagreement
Companies that produce breast pumps are now being talked about online because of advertisements that carry milking mothers to cows that are milked.
The company Elvie published a bundled ad to mark a presentation of what is said to be "the world's first silent breast pump that can be worn on the outside". The ad is inspired by music videos and is supposed to show the freedom that the new pump provides mothers who are breastfed.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cow we song with lyrics such as, "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail on me" and "If you didn't notice, these aren't jugs but my breasts."
The appendix continues: “Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I pump milk from the jugs.”
However, the advert, which appeared on the company's Facebook page, has caused online publicity.
The video has a 77,000 ratings and hundreds of reviews and has received varying responses from viewers, who say many people associate it with the "horror" that accompanies the milk industry.
“It’s a really bad decision to use a cow to advertise this product.
Just like us, they have to become calf-full and bare to produce milk, except what the calves are taken from them just a few days after they are born," said in one of the remarks.
The Elvie breast pump fits comfortably into the Elvie/Mother breast pump.
Another observer wrote: “Obviously difficult for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breast pump for mothers who get to keep their babies?"
Another added: “This ad is completely out of step with time.”
Others came to the defense of the ad, and one woman admitted that she felt the song was "awesome."
“I think it’s a great idea.
I would have bought this if I still had a baby.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping milk.
It’s a little crazy, but I took it the way it is.
This is a brilliant product," one of the viewers wrote.
Another said: “It’s a fun advert aimed at mothers who pump milk (often at work or inside a toilet) and feel like ‘cows.’
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the commercial, the women's group shows that they were all dancing with the breast pumps hidden in their bras.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is that many women say they feel like cows when they pump milk.
However, the Elvie pump is quite quiet, has no wires or cords and fits comfortably on top of a bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and head of Mother, said: “The Elvie pumpkin is so revolutionary that it deserved a prominent presentation that would bring publicity.
By simulating women as cows, we wanted to focus on breast pumping and all of its challenges, and even show in a fun and familiar way how much freedom the new pump would provide.
This is not the first time the Elvie pumpkin has been on the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a two-child mother appeared at a fashion show for designer Martha Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to camp near Texas border
The number of immigrant children in detention has increased suddenly even though the number of those crossing the border on a monthly basis has remained roughly the same. Part of the reason is that harsh speeches and policies put forward by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to get the children into temporary foster care.
Usually, the foster parents have been unregistered immigrants themselves, and have feared jeopardizing their chances of remaining in the country, by volunteering to foster a child.
The risk increased in June, when public authorities announced that potential foster parents and other adults within the household would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, an immigration and customs officer, testified before the Senate, saying that his institution had arrested a number of people who applied to foster single children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not on a criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or in foster homes are in the country illegally, and many of them are illegal immigrants on the criminal record.
“We’re still looking for them,” said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to process the children's cases more quickly, representatives announced new rules requiring some of the children to appear in court within a month of being placed in custody, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous criterion, according to staff working in the proceedings.
Many of them will come through video conferencing, rather than in person, to argue their legal position before immigration judges.
The children who are sentenced to ineligible for entry into the country are sent out of the country quickly.
The longer children are in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent or refugee attempts, according to the staff of the refuges and reports published by the system over the past month.
Proponents said that these problems are even more likely in a larger institution such as Tornillo, as it is likely that no one notices even if a child is having a hard time, due to the number of them.
They added that moving the children to the tent city without providing enough time to prepare them spiritually or say goodbye to friends could add to a shock that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria says U.S., France and Turkey's 'military' forces to withdraw immediately
Walid al-Moualem, the foreign minister, also said in his speech to the UN General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even if the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays the role of deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegal in Syria, under the false assumption that they are fighting terrorism, and that "they will be treated accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told parliament.
Moualem staunchly claimed that the "war on terror was almost over" in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to wage this holy struggle until we clear all Syrian areas" by both terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign parties."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, with most of them training and advising both Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
As for the issue of refugees, Moualem said that conditions were good enough for them to return and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading a causeless fear" that encouraged refugees to stay away.
"We have called for an international community and humanitarian organization to facilitate their return," he said.
“They make politics out of something that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funding for reconstruction in Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The U.N. says that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up neutral territory with the last major stronghold of the resistance has created an opportunity to continue political dialogue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a major attack by Syrian forces sponsored by Russia, on the region where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the deal had a "clear final deadline" and expressed the hope that military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front, who have links with Al-Qaeda, and that they "would be eliminated."
Staffan de Mistura, the UN ambassador, hopes to be able to come to the first meetings with a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition, to draft a constitution for Syria after the war and pay the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, and said that its work should be limited to "exceeding the provisions of the current government," and warned against any interference.
Reasons why Trump will win another election season
According to that reasoning, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 re-election, unless charges and scandals end his presidential career, as many liberal observers are likely to hope.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end to a presidential career ever!"
As it is, the audience bears no fatigue marks.
Since 2014, ratings at best have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN, and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its best, an increase from 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's show, "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped the ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers on important news nights.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to, because this is something that we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the ABC drama show's co-director of "Designated Survivor" about an employee within the government who becomes president after the Senate is completely destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell, experienced comedy writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another hypothesis.
She remembers a trip in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Ms. Scovell said to me.
There is an entertainment value in the mess.
However, unlike what is shown on television, the stories from Washington could determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether families of immigrants can unite and the health of the international economy.
Only those viewers who enjoy what the greatest privilege can afford to stop watching.
And yet this is more than being an enlightened citizen when you look at the sixth time a group of experts argue the use of Bob Woodward's "very close" sources for his book "Fear," or a $15,000 jacket made of ostrich leather worn by Paul Manafort ("a garment lined with arrogance," said the Washington Post) and a derivation of Trump's exactitude.
I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does and makes you feel like this is like a reality show, is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the show "Pawn Stars", as he discussed the staff turnover in Trump's show and daily changes to the storyline (e.g., starting a fight with N. KimL.

He could not tear himself away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.

Money to flow outside the narrowest elections of the mid-term
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district sees the money flowing to it, thanks to a rescheduling of electoral districts that led to two delegates competing for the same seat.
The newly reorganized Pittsburg area sends out Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a second-choice district in a special election last summer.
Lamb offers himself against fellow Representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now representing the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which overlaps greatly with the new 17th District.
The maps of polling areas were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old polling areas were organized in favor of Republicans and that it violated the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th district has been the start of a race in funding election campaigns between major funders of both parties, the Democratic Select Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Select Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election in March for the 18th District of Pennsylvania, but many followed that election.
Republicans had previously defended that seat for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the ballot by a 20-point margin.
Political experts have given Democrats a bit of an advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for its support of China, but then withdrew.
Government officials noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little objection from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until co-owners drove the Trump coalition management team off.
Representatives of the State Department decided to call back the U.S. ambassador to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to a "recent decision to recognize Tævan no longer," said Heather Nauert, the ministry's spokeswoman in a statement early this month.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million from the United States for aid efforts in 2017, including for drug control, development, and economic support.
The penalties, which included a reduction in financial support and restrictions on the issue of residence permits, would have been painful for the Central American country, where high unemployment rates and homicide rates are high.
As insider meetings continued, U.S. and Central American representatives suspended a conference on security and economic success and were to follow a similar meeting held last year that was considered to be a step forward in measures to prevent people from moving to the United States.
However, in mid-September, top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and as a result ended all speculation about sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now to address the conference, scheduled to take place in mid-October, as a sign of how important it is in the eyes of the government, the diplomats said.
The three U.S. ambassadors also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to discuss in more detail the discussions described by the three U.S. Representatives, including two ambassadors, who agreed to discuss the inside arguments against being allowed to remain anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst who works closely with the board and also spoke about the case against anonymity.
Learn the story
The next scandal could be Robert Mueller's report, a special prosecutor, on Mr. Trump's possible actions to obstruct justice, but for that accusation there is a wide range of public evidence.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller reverses his investigation also into whether Mr. Trump's election campaign worked with Russia in its attack on our election.
If the Senate becomes run by another party, Trump may have to take responsibility for it, at the time he prepares to meet with his voters again, and perhaps jury-appointed his peers.
This is very uncertain, however, and I don’t want to suggest that Trump’s case is unambiguous, nor his colleague’s case in Europe.
We all need to choose, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the struggle will be.
In 1938, German advisers were ready to plunder Hitler's power, only if Western countries had resisted and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of disaster that followed.
The story revolves around such important points and faster or stalls for the unstoppable progress of democracy.
The United States is facing some such important points now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who is in charge of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this paper reported that last year he had proposed making secret tapes of the president and discussed whether he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times news is not correct.
“How will we respond if the recent FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not thorough or fair, or if he is confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote for Congress in the midterm that will let Mr. Trump take responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have to endure a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia and was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime and used to sit in my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I but look positively to our future?"

Graham Dorrans, Rangers team, optimistic for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win against the Austrians will put them in a strong position to get out of the European G Group. Rangers made a magnificent draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month.
An injury to the knee prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing his first game of the season until the game against Villareal which ended in a 2-2 draw, but he believes the Rangers can make use of those results as a springboard for better results.
"It was good to get this point for us, because Villarreal is a strong team," said Dorrans, aged 31.
“We started the game in the belief that we could achieve something and ended up taking one point.
Perhaps we could have squeezed a win at the end, but overall a tie was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came strong in the second half and played better.
Thursday is another important night for the European league.
Hopefully we can reach three points but it will be a difficult game because they went well in their last game. But with the spectators supporting us I am sure we will endure this and get a positive result.
Last year was difficult, both because of my injuries and the changes that occurred in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling on the spot.
The team is good and the boys are enjoying themselves, the training is good.
Hopefully we can go further now, put the last season behind us and succeed."
Women lose sleep because of fear of losing their retirement savings
Although participants in the poll had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide survey, said they discussed with their partners the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they would discuss this with their children.
"People want a family member to care about that, but it doesn't take the right steps to have those conversations," said Holly Snyder, deputy director of Nationwide's life insurance department.
Here's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t make your wishes clear in advance.
Talk to your counselor and your family about where and when you receive care, because these options can change a lot in terms of costs.
Get your financial advisor involved: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care are traditional life insurance with long-term care, mixed life insurance that pays out in cash, to help pay for expenses, or self-insurance with your own money – as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: Prevent legal disputes in advance.
Get a manager for your health care so that you can nominate someone you trust to oversee your health care and ensure that health care professionals comply with your wishes if you can't say them directly yourself.
Also, consider getting a procurator for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your accounts are paid if you can't do it yourself.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in an emergency and is on the way to a hospital.

Man shot multiple times with air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air gun as he was on his way home on foot after being outside having fun.
The victim is a man in his fifties and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Representatives describe the shooting, which occurred at about 2:30 a.m. local British time, as a "random attack."
The victim did not see his attacker.
The man was not injured and police have called witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died after a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the number of dead is expected to rise.
As all communications are down, relief workers have been unable to provide any information from Donggala County, an area north of Palu and located near the center of the earthquake, which was 7.5 on the Richter.
More than 16,000 people were left homeless in Palu after the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province and is located for the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The estimated number of inhabitants was 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a county that covers more than 380 km of coastline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is a province-controlled area, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main industries in the Central Sulawesi region, especially in the Donggala coastal area.
Nickel mines are also important in the region, most of which are in Morowali, which is on the beach facing Sulawesi.
Floods have washed over Palu and Donggala several times in the past century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, over 200 people died when a tsunami struck and hundreds of houses in Donggala were destroyed.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia sits on the active fire ring of the Pacific Ocean, where earthquakes are regular.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Aceh region in northern Sumatra struck on December 26, triggering a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people across the Indian Ocean coastline, of which more than half were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes crossed the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds die on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 on Richter struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 on Richter struck near the city of Padang, the capital of a province in western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 on Richter struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, and raised up to 10-metre high tsunamis, destroying a number of villages and killing around 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck Pidie Jaya County in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunamis were generated this time, but over 100 people died as buildings collapsed.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing over 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, a former Alaskan governor and presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for trying to prevent a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report by the Alaska State Police, published on Saturday.
According to a police report, Palin took the phone off her friend when she tried to call the police to report an alleged crime.
Palin is being held at Mat-Su station, where he is being heard in court, and he is being held against $500 bail, according to a report from KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring that he was "not guilty, indeed" when asked to declare guilt or innocence, according to the news station.
Palin is charged with three Class A crimes, meaning he could be sentenced to up to one year in prison and face a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B offense, which is punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaskan surrender court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, for obstructing the notification of domestic violence, and for carrying weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend has claimed he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of surrendering soldiers in 2016 after she blamed a traumatic stress disorder on her son's violent behavior, after his military service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Richter triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications systems are down and the number of dead is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the center of Sulawesi Island, which lies northeast from Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos that show when the incident happened now go around on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the beach.
Prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attacker in New York City
Prosecutors in New York want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of having participated in a terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people. This is a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for violating federal law since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is believed to have hired a Home Depot truck to attack people on a bike path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan. He drove down there walking and cycling pedestrians in October.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and caused serious bodily harm "intentionally", according to the will statement to use the death penalty, which was filed in the Southern District Court in New York.
Both of these charges can lead to a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Many weeks after the attack, the federal judge charged Saipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for criminal purposes, which is usually used by prosecutors in charges against organized crime organizations. Also, Saipov was charged with violent crimes and for destroying a car.
The attack involved "significantly planned planning," prosecutors said, describing Sapiov's actions as "horrible, cruel, and immoral."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov suffered injuries, injuries and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
The five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the southern region of New York last resorted to the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in a New York court case in 1953, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The couple were both euthanized in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed no signs of remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he was doing well with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he had got the idea for the attack after watching videos from ISIS on his phone, as stated in the indictment.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has declared his innocence in all 22 counts of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the official defendersSaipov, said that they were "of course disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea against life imprisonment without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma caused by this event for all concerned," Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative Party MP says NIGEL FARAGE should lead negotiations over Brexit.
Nigel Farage promised to "activate the people's army" today at a protest at a Conservative conference.
This former leader of Ukip said that politicians must "feel the pressure" from EU sceptics, at the same time as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative leader Peter Bone said at the Birmingham protest march that Britain "would be out" now if Mr Farage was the leader for Brexit.
But the challenge that May faces in reconciling deep differences between her own team members came to light even more as Conservatives, who want to remain in the EU, took part in other anti-Brexit protests in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers plan on track and is under criticism from those in favour of Brexit, those opposed, and the EU.
The Allies claimed that she will continue to fight to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition - and force those opposed to Brexit and the Labour Party to choose between her plan and "disruption".
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave protest march in Solihull that he wanted to "disengage from the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been allowed to participate and take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out now,” he said.
The MP from Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit but we have to get rid of the Chequers plan."
He explained his opposition to the EU, saying: “We did not fight in world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone dismissed evidence that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British public has changed its mind and wants to stay is completely false."
Andrea Jenkyns, a conservative supporter of Brexit, was also on the protest march, telling reporters: “I simply want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers program is unpopular among the public and the opposition will not vote with it. It enjoys unpopularity among our party members and activists who are on the streets voting for us.
Please, cancel the Chequers program and start listening."
In a direct message to May, she added, "Prime Ministers keep their jobs as they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage said that the politicians must be allowed to "feel the pressure" if they were to evade the decision made following the 2016 vote.
"This is about trust between us - the people - and our political party," he said.
“They want to try to cheat Brexit and we’re here today to say to them, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with this.’
He added in his message to the crowd: “I want you to feel pressure from your political party, which is betraying Brexit.
We are active in the public army in this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing, proud Great Britain."
At the same time, EU supporters held a protest march in Birmingham, which ended with a two-hour protest rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved the Conservatives' flags against Brexit after the group was set up this weekend.
Lord Adonis, of the Labour Party, made fun of conservatives due to security issues raised in the party's telephone program when the conference was opened.
"These are the people who tell us that it can have all the computer systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for border without barriers, for free trade with Ireland without borders," he added.
“This is a complete scandal.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he said.
Warren is going to "consider seriously" to run for the presidency.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she plans to "consider a serious run for the presidency" after the November election.
A report from the Boston Globe says that the Democrat from Massachusetts discussed his future at a citizens' meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has infrequently criticized U.S. President Donald Trump, is running for reelection in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was a co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been the centerpiece of the speculation that she could run against Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke this afternoon was her 36th meeting in the form of a civil meeting with residents of her district, since Trump took office.
One of the people at the meeting asked her if she would like to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington and fix our government, and then a woman is also needed as a leader."
Arrest after deadly shooting at Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that she had arrested one suspect in the case of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, but he was shot dead on Friday.
Baton Rouge police reported the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
She had previously posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a person seen on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died from it," said Murphy J. Paul, police chief, to the media on Saturday, according to a report from 247sports.
Wayde came to the defense of his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to having been on the scene, with weapons in his possession, and admitted to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested troublelessly and placed in custody at the eastern Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was a two-yard tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, he played in 32 games, 10 of which started in the last season and played an average of 17.4 minutes, scoring 5.6 points, and achieving 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after Sebastian Vettel gives him the winning seat by order of their team.
It was evident from the fact that Valtteri Bottas took a seat in front of Lewis Hamilton at pre-launch on Saturday, that orders from Mercedes' team would play a major part in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start, leaving Hamilton almost behind as he defended his position in the first two turns, inviting Vettel to fight his teammate.
Vettel went first in the pit, leaving Hamilton to drive into the round at the end of the group, but it should have been able to determine the outcome.
The Mercedes car went into the pit one lap later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton emerged after a close encounter where Ferrari's driver was forced to leave the inner side after risking being left behind, after defensive attempts in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started in the rear of the group and was seventh at the end of the first round, on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the race as he postponed changing tyres to try to finish quickly and surpass Kimi Raikkonen and reach fourth place.
He eventually went to the pit for lap 44 but could not increase the speed in the remaining eight laps, and Raikkonen took fourth.
This is a difficult day because Valtteri was doing well all weekend and was a true gentleman to let me go.
The team has done tremendously to achieve this result," said Hamilton.
It was a really bad body language.
U.S. President Donald Trump joked about Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday, over her claims that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but did not directly discuss the testimony of Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead, he said that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "bad and cruel and untruthful."
"The only thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and cruel and untruthful," he said.
“When you see the impressions and leaks and then say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you enjoy this?
Do you remember her answer... did you miss the document-- oh, huh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Just wait a little.
Let's... No, we didn't lie it," he said, mimicking the senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, stating the allegations made by Ford against Kavanaugh, and so it was leaked in early September. Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't lie to her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to a report from The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it in confidence and I did as she asked.”
But her denial did not seem to go well with the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday: “I’ll tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't lie, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued his defense of Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women, and insisted that Democrats were taking advantage of the allegations.
“They are determined to regain power, no matter what methods need to be used.
You see the cruelty, the cruelty, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to elect over to take power and control," the president said, according to a report from Mediaite.
Elite League Division: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars improved for their loss on Friday in the Elite League league against the Belfast Giants, with a win in the following game, 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were given an early two-goal lead after goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized for the locals, but Dwyer then brought the Giants back over.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee and two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen then secured their victory.
This was the third losing match of the season for Adam Keefe's team in the Elite League league, but it had won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth game between the teams in the season, and the Giants had won the three games before.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the fourth minute when the clock showed 3.35, after a stint from Kendall McFaul. David Rutherford then came with a stint when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
There was then a lot to be done in the first few minutes and Sullivan brought the locals back into the game when the clock showed at 13.10 and Cownie then leveled after a stint from Matt Marquardt in the fifteenth minute.
Dwyer made sure to get the Giants over before halftime when he scored his second goal of the game at the end of the first third of the game.
The home team folded, and Bouchard re-balanced after a goal when they were one man over in the 27th minute of the second game third.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together and helped Nielsen get Dundee over for the first time in the game late in the second quarter, and he secured his team victory with the fifth goal when half of the last quarter was over.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure hundreds of passengers on plane escape earthquake
Indonesia's air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after he died ensuring a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a flood.
Large aftershocks continue to plague the area, and many are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
The 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, despite the fact that his colleagues had fled the control tower that surged violently at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained there to ensure that the Batik Air aircraft number 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake struck, could safely take off.
He then jumped from the control tower when he thought he was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to a report from ABC News in Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We’re very sad to hear that,” he added.
Authorities fear that the number of dead could exceed a thousand, as the country's disaster agency says access is restricted to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"It is estimated that the number of dead is still rising because many bodies are still under rubble and cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Up to six-metre high waves have caused massive destruction in Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
The military and passenger aircraft are working to bring relief supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance comes with a body.
There is very little clean water.
The small markets have been robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said in an interview with CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to find survivors but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Joko Widodo, Indonesia’s president, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, earthquakes struck Lombok, Indonesia, killing over 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says missing after plane crashes into lagoon
The airline, which had a plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, now says that one person is missing, having previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in an announcement that as of Saturday afternoon, it did not know about the demise of one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about details of the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it attempted to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and that the condition of all of them was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and what the exact sequence of events was.
The airline and U.S. Navy both said the plane had landed in the lagoon just ahead of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had gone too far over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the aircraft's approach had been extremely low.
“It was really good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others were able to wade deep into the water and reach emergency exits in the sinking aircraft.
He said that the airmen had been frightened and shouting and that he had suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who were at work a short distance from repairing a dock also helped with the rescue by using an inflated boat to ferry people ashore, before the aircraft sank into approximately 30 feet of deep water.
Data from the Air Safety Agency show that 111 people have died in PNG-registered plane crashes over the past two decades, none of which were related to Air Niugini.
An expert describes the timeline of the evening in which a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors closed their case on Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert from the U.S. Department of Justice, was in the courtroom for many hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile phone records to puzzle together the journeys of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said she received location data from several cell phones showing Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to his previous claims, according to a report from The Clarion Ledger.
When evidence showed that his cell phone was with Chamber at the same time he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he had not been in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said it was "a lie, because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said she had known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted text messages, phone calls, and her contact information from her phone.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
The defenders are scheduled to deliver their final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be submitted to jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
Hip hop trios want to fight against negative attitudes towards the music genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop was removed from its origins as it contained political messages and dealt with social issues.
They want to seek the origin again and make consciously hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen recent booms in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York foster parents sue couple over expulsion after 'prejudiced' text message
Foster in New York is suing a couple for illegal expulsion after she accidentally received a text message from her mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The pair therefore refuse to be prejudiced and liken the lawsuit to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed displeasure when she learned that her new foster mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first showed up for work in 2016.
"NEEEEEIIIII OTHER BLACK MAN" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
After discovering her mistake, Ms. Maurice's "disgraceful" fired Plasco-Flaxman, saying that their ex-fiancé, who was black, had done poorly, and that she had expected to get a Filipino woman, according to a report from the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her one working day and then sent home in an Uber car.
Maurice now sues the couple and wants to receive compensation for the expulsion, in the amount of $350 a day for the six-month job she had originally been hired for, although no contract was signed.
"I wanted to show them that you shouldn't do that," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have objected to the accusations that they are prejudiced, saying that it was the right thing in the case to fire Maurice, because they felt they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent me a message she didn’t want to say.
She's not prejudiced.
We are not prejudiced people," said husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
“But who would trust their children after showing that kind of rudeness, even if it was a surprise?
His newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco likened the lawsuit to "extortion," saying that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in "very difficult circumstances."
Are you going to attack someone in this situation?
It's not very nicely done," said Plasco, who works in the investment sector.
The case is still in court, but the public has spoken harshly about the pair on social media and shamed it for its behavior and reasoning.
Paddington's publishers feared readers would find it difficult to like the talking bear, says a new letter.
Karen Jankel, daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
"It's very funny now that we know of Paddington's enormous success."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book about a small toy bear, had taken the rejection of his work with calming positivity, adding that the book's sixty-year anniversary was "sweet" after his death last year.
As for Paddington, which she describes as "a very important family member," she added that her father had shown silent pride in his eventual success.
"He was a very quiet man and not used to boasting," she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child who accomplishes something. You’re proud of it even if you haven’t done anything yourself really.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although Paddington was a creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington credit to himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her through the phone
When she landed, her daughter had been taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but without success.
"Nad called regularly and told me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to survive," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me and said she would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given her to maintain her heart rate were gradually losing their activity and being excreted from the body.
She had died a short time before and this was her body giving up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all happening.
I couldn’t bark or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to be in control.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving for her dead daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers who knew none of the difficulties she experienced.
“Nobody knew anything,” she said.
“My head was falling and my tears were falling all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a lot of sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving women hang up messages to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who had loved ones who committed suicide are now trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted a message on a bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and phone numbers that people can call and get help.
Tyler, the son of Miss Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I have to feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said her son had been a successful cook with a contagious smile.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could light up any room."
He stopped working before he died, because he was "sunk down in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, at the age of 11, found his brother dead after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said: "I am constantly concerned that there will be a aftermath of it."
Ms. Davis created the message “to let people know that it is possible to go and talk to others, even a friend.
Don’t sit around and say nothing – you need to talk to someone.”
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Ms. Davies for years, lost Mark, her husband to age 15, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He was up at his worst on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents he didn't look into their eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a shock to them, but that they had to work their way up: “This is tearing the family apart.
This will tear us apart.
We have to keep going and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on a thread as the FBI has its investigation
"I thought if we could get something similar to what he asked for - a study with limited time and scope - we might be able to achieve a little bit of reconciliation," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was "falling apart" in the midst of a conflict between the parties where everything was in a backlock.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican Party supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their delay is due to the timing.
The midterm elections are in just five weeks, on November 6. If the Republicans fail, as expected, it seriously weakens their efforts to get their man elected to sit in the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush has been calling on senators to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife Ashley through him, who was Mr. Bush's private secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its investigation report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sitting.
It is not yet certain whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, but that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break up the tie and confirm him in the office of Supreme Court Justice.
The number of those fleeing North Korea 'reminiscent' under Kim
The number of those fleeing North Korea and going to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a member of parliament from South Korea.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted data from South Korea's Unification Council, saying that 1,127 people had fled last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border protection between North Korea and China and higher fees charged by smugglers with people are key factors.
Pyongyang has not issued any official statement.
The vast majority of those fleeing North Korea are offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee to China, but it has the longest border with North Korea, and is easier to cross than the well-maintained neutral zone between North and South Korea.
China sees the refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused mainly on postponed nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This was after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to roughly work together towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's foreign minister blamed U.S. trade bans on the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about the security of our country and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to unilaterally take down our nuclear weapons first," Ri said in his speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "motherfucker" and says he is unfit to serve as a Supreme Court justice
Nancy Pelosi, the minority's leader in Congress called Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee of the Supreme Court judge "maternal" and said he was too temperamental to be able to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi dropped these words in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever acted like this, she would have been called hysterical," Pelosi said of his response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied, out of great feeling, allegations that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was extremely emotional, sometimes driving it close to shouting and getting a cookie in his throat as he discussed his family and school years.
He also publicly denounced Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him "disgusting and orchestrated manslaughter" that was orchestrated by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because he showed that he is biased towards Democrats.
"I think these claims and how he attacked the Clintons and Democrats show that he is unfit for the job," she said.
Pelosi did not respond when asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh fired if he is confirmed and if the Democrats reach a majority in Congress.
"I'll say this: if he's not telling Congress or the FBI the truth, he's not only unfit to be on the Supreme Court, but also on the court that he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh now serves as a judge on the Washington, D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Abortion Act Roe v. Wade, in which he is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing, Kavanaugh turned away from questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is no time for a hysterical, biased person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say 'much is wonderful.'"
Women need to take advantage of it.
This is a righteous saying, months and years of fury springing up out of it, and it does not come forth without weeping.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, but you?”
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager somewhere and said she was crying too when she got angry, but she had developed a technique so when she got angry and started crying, she said to her interviewer, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed to express anger in part because they are fundamentally mistaken.
One of my clearest memories from the previous job I held in an office with men in the majority, where I started to cry with rage that I could not express, an older woman came and took in my neck dream. She was a cold boss that I had always feared a bit and she dragged me into the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’re glad you got in.”
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart when he was running for president, at which time she was a Democrat from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught cheating on a boat named Monkey Business (Apaspil) and withdrew her offer, Ms. Schroeder, full of frustration, thought there was no reason why she could not consider running for president.
"It wasn't a good decision," she said laughing at me, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone gave this the name "Melt White and the Seven Dwarfs.""
Since the campaign was long overdue, she was behind in terms of fundraising, so she vowed not to volunteer unless she was able to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" she wondered.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not formally present herself, she was so overcome with emotion – gratitude to the people who had supported her, resentment towards the system, which made it so difficult to raise money and direct her vision to voters instead of representatives, and anger at the gender inequality – that she burst into tears.
“You might think I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder said as she recalled how the media reacted.
“I thought Kleenex was my sponsor.

Why a trade war between the U.S. and China could be good for Beijing
The first shots of the trade war between the United States and China were arduous, and although the war is far from over, the gulf between the countries could be favorable for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing a tax on China's main export products, including solar batteries, steel and aluminum.
The biggest rise came this week with new tariffs covering $200 billion worth of goods (150 billion pounds), and taxing as much as half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has responded in the same currency each time and recently imposed a 5 to 10 percent tariff on US products worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to respond to the US tariff, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will soon succumb.
In order to get Washington to rally, it would have to yield to demands, but it would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, China's president, to publicly bow to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing holds the cards correctly, pressure from the trade war with the United States could have a positive impact on China in the long run, by reducing the mutual need for both economies for each other.
"The fact that a quick political decision either in Washington or Beijing could lead to a situation leading to an economic downturn in either country is actually much more dangerous than the audience has previously acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, an investigator who focuses mainly on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for refugees to return willingly to the country and is seeking help to rebuild the country, which is now in a bad state after a seven-year war.
Walid al Moualem, the foreign minister spoke at the United Nations General Assembly, saying that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to establish normal conditions by building up areas that were completely destroyed by terrorists.
Everything is now ready for refugees to return willingly to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic decisions aimed at their daily lives and jobs.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of aid.
Al-Moualem said that Syrian authorities would gladly accept assistance in rebuilding the country.
However, he stressed that they would not accept aid depending on conditions or aid from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the United States team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 points on the Le Golf National field outside of Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team, led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, achieved the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled most throughout the race, hit his starting shot into the water on the 16th hole, a par 3, and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone brightly in all his games and became 1 of 4 players to get the result 5-0-0, since the race began using his current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 against Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, who was at the bottom of the European team's ranking.
Dustin Johnson, who is at the top of the list of the world's best golfers, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who possibly played in his last race for the Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times for the Ryder Cup, became the most successful European of the competition with a career-high 25.5 points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t do anything else.
It has been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and it was my pleasure to be able to help," said emotional Garcia after Europe's victory.
He hands his country the John Rahm torch, but he defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singles match on Sunday.
“I was incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and is now listed with 13-21-3 in competitions for the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange conclusion for one of the best players in history, who has won 14 major titles and is only in second place after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find themselves on the field, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a good game throughout the race.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after disappointment with his team's performance, "I'm proud of them, they fought.
It was sometime in the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him down.
I'll take it down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players play very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with the PGA in the U.S. and the Ryder Cup committee, and we'll continue.
I love these 12 men and am proud to be their captain.
You have to take it down.
“They played better than us.”
