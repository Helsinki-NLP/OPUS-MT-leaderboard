Biden leads polls in three key countries
With only 100 days to go, Democratic candidate Joe Biden enjoys an advantage in three key swing states.
CNN reports today that Biden was transferred to Florida, Arizona, and Michigan.
In Florida, Biden has a 51% follow-up to the president's 46%.
In Arizona, the score is 49%-45% Biden at will, and in Michigan, heading for Biden's overall victory, where he leads by 12 points, 52%-40%.
To win the November election, after 100 days, Trump needs to turn all of these states around, and indeed more.
Trump sits up these days with a coronavirus epidemic that is increasingly being taught by his countrymen, saying the vast majority of respondents to the federal government have reacted badly, or very badly, at the beginning of the epidemic.
In addition, Trump has come out of the protests and riots that sprang up at the death of George Floyd.
Trump and his administration have failed miserably.
To corroborate Trump's problem, he now faces serious criticism for ordering FBI agents to crack down on protests in cities where mayors or governors are Democrats.
It has created a huge wolf population among the cities, and that anger is contagious to other Americans.
Photographs of federal police cracking protesters into unmarked cars have also not helped the cause of the United States.
The Lincoln Project's advert drew attention to this very point, but it can be seen below.
Trump won all three states in 2016, but with very little vote.
In fact, Trump defeated very many states by a small margin of vote and won the election by a minority of votes.
Michigan, for example, won by only 10,704 votes.
That’s less than 0.5% of the population.
Almost all the polls that political commentators say significant are showing the same result, Biden being taken over.
A new CNN survey in Arizona shows that Biden's advantage is now out of the scope of the survey.
The same is true of CNN and Quinnipiac University's surveys of Florida.
Even Fox News, which leans well to the right and declared support for Trump in 2016, has published surveys of the same substance in its media.
The president's last hope, according to the results of the polls, is that Trump could hope to regain a following in important places within swing states if attention in the campaign is focused on the economy.
The U.S. economy took a heavy hit following the COVID-19 pandemic, but voters do not seem to be linking the economic shock to the coronavirus pandemic.
That is to say, the vast majority of voters seem to blame Trump for having failed to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, but trust him more to deal with the economic shock that the state currently faces.
However, Trump has not been very successful in campaigning for the presidency.
Following the riots that have flamed almost continuously since the news was heard of the video disturbingly in which four police officers killed George Floyd, Trump tried to steer the discussion to law enforcement and its importance.
Law and Order, became his motto.
It seems to have failed miserably, as I said earlier.
As polls lean more on Trump, more and more Republicans are more likely to resign from Trump and declare support for either Biden, or someone else, who is then Biden without specifically naming him.
They do this because of the arrangement in the United States to vote in multiple elections on the same ballot.
Thus, a voter can simply label the second party in the presidential ballot portion of the ballot, and make it stand alone as a vote for all other candidates of that party on the ballot.
Thus, Republican Party candidates in other offices are tempted to break away from Trump's slacker gang and achieve independent results in the election.
Youth Olympic Games in Dakar postponed to 2026
The Youth Olympic Games were scheduled to take place in Dakar next year, but they have now been postponed to 2026 due to the coronavirus pandemic after the International Olympic Committee and Senegal reached an agreement on it.
However, the suspension of the first Olympic Games to be held in Africa is a shock to many young athletes.
Volunteer arrested for burning in Nantes
A volunteer at Nantes Cathedral in France has been arrested in connection with a fire that completely destroyed the church.
Le Monde has stated that the suspect, a Rwandan refugee who served as an overseer in the church, has admitted to setting the fire.
The man's lawyer says in a conversation with another media outlet that the man big-eyes his actions.
Among the destroyed by the fire were a 17th-century organ and historically depicted windows of the church.
The 39-year-old volunteer, who has not been named, was arrested shortly after the July 18 fire, but he was then released.
He was then remanded to report yesterday and subsequently placed in custody.
“No way out of this.”
I am well received at the home of Baltasar and Kristjana Samper in Kópavogur.
The occasion of my visit is a new art exhibition by Baltasar and his daughter, Mireyu, which will be opened on 1 August in Hlaðan at Little Kambi on Snæfellsnes.
This is the first time the band has shown up together.
I am led down to Baltasar's workshop where a magnificent painting confronts me.
Large and dreary images of hags of the past but also of flying creatures; an eagle on one, shadows birds on the other.
From the workshop is out in the garden of the home.
“We had a horse with us that bit the grass,” says Baltasar to me.
“The horse works much better than a lawn mower on these hills and hills that we have.”
Mireya is with us Kristjana and Baltasar and she tells about how her work rhymes with the works that are here.
“Insertments, a combination of paperwork and art sculpture.
They're all very white and in contrast to what my dad's doing, where I'm working with the light and stuff like that," she says.
It’s been a year since this idea came up.
Then there were certain works that I was working on and would have liked to show there, but they got stuck in Tokyo out of Covid.
When my father had begun painting and I saw where he was going, I reconsidered my part," says Mireya, whose work Baltasar has strongly promoted in Icelandic folk tales about women's choirs and choirs.
“When I saw that my dad was doing these paintings with the girls, I thought it was ideal to make a piece of jewelry related to them,” says Mireya, but she works with Sigurd Inga Bjarnason, a goldsmith in Sign’s shop.
“I’m going to take a breather out of it.”
Last year Mireya attended the exhibition of 72 artists of the Academy of the Perception at Snæfellsnes, including in the barn at Little Kambi and found the building fascinating.
"This is a new space, an old load that has just been repaired," says Mireya, who chatted there with Baldvina Sverrisdóttir, who suggested that Mireya and Baltasar put on a show together.
“She wanted us both to show and then we thought:
“Why not?
That's a good idea."
Born in 1938 in Spain, Baltasar Samper attended the University of the Arts in Barcelona before going on a world tour to study art museums and conduct research.
He came here in Iceland in 1961 and was fascinated by the country and the nation.
He came back here a short time later, met his wife, Kristjana, and has lived here continuously since 1963, for 57 years.
Baltasar is a prolific artist, has held dozens of private exhibitions, and exhibitions with Kristjana widely.
He is best known for his large murals, including a mural in Flateyjarkirkja and a fresco in Víðisðakirkja.
“What affects what I do is the bitterness that Iceland has and no other place,” Baltasar says.
“This low sun and these shadows that stretch and stretch.
As soon as I got here, I thought, “Wow, you can work here.”
Mireya is the eldest of the children Kristjöna and Baltasar, born in 1964.
“There was one thing I knew, it was quite clear, that I wasn’t going to be an artist,” she says, asking if she wanted to follow in her parents’ footsteps.
“So I went to high school and did everything I could to get away from it.
Then I realized I was running away.
Then you just have to give up," Mireya says and laughs.
She, like her father, has shown the world around her.
A lot in Japan, to take a picture.
All the children of Baltasar and Kristjana have followed the art path.
"I call it a virus," Mireya says.
“There was no way out of this.”
Icelandair says it has been in a grey area when flight attendants were dismissed
The Minister of Social Affairs believes Icelandair had been in a grey area when the company dismissed all flight attendants in the middle of a dispute.
He then said he had asked for a law that would allow firefighters to enter a residential building to be considered after the fire on the Brother City Trail.
On 17 July, Icelandair announced its intention to terminate all 38 of the airline’s employees while the airline’s core business was still on the board of state mediators.
There were comments on whether Icelandair had been able to take action on these terminations and was prepared for the case to be resolved before the Social Court.
To this end, however, the airlines and Icelandair reached together more than 24 hours after the layoffs.
However, Asmundur Einar Dadason, the Minister of Social Affairs, says that in his mind, Icelandair’s decision was in a grey area and was taken on the right of wage earners.
“I think it’s a right to protect employees.
When you’re in a conversation, when you’re inside a settlement partner, it’s not an option to go this way.
It is quite clear in my mind that this would not have happened.
I think it is quite clear, in my mind, that men had entered into a grey area there what this touched," says Asmund.
He will not argue that other companies go the same way as Icelandair.
“You also now see a dangerous discussion that it is only natural to start shoving this system up to reduce this right, and that’s why I’m totally opposed.”
At Explosive this morning, Asmund was also asked about the government's reaction to the fire on a fraternal city path at the end of June, where three people died.
The Minister says the investigation of the matter is now on the table of Housing and Civil Engineering, to which he has addressed recommendations.
“Today, it is illegal for firefighters to enter a building.
I have asked the Housing and Construction Authority to look specifically at whether there is a reason for going to any legislative changes.
I am ready to come forward with the legal changes that are needed to reduce the likelihood that this can happen again," says Asmundur Einar.

US says increased pressure on contractor Nord Stream 2 - RT Business News
The US government has made further efforts to force European companies to abandon the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project led by Russia, according to Welt am Sonntag, citing people familiar with the issue.
According to the newspaper, State Department, Treasury and U.S. Department of Energy officials have contacted European contractors to ensure they are aware of the consequences of continuing the project.
Up to twelve officials are to have held at least two online meetings with representatives of the companies in the last few days.
Those who witnessed the talks said that the Americans had in a "friendly" tone stressed that the United States wanted to prevent Nord Stream 2 from becoming a reality.
"I think this is a very, very serious threat," one of the tourists told the German media.
These threats are consistent with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's comments last week, warning that companies involved in the project would best "get out now" or face penalties under the 232 parts of the infamous Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
In addition to the Russian energy giant Gazprom, which oversees the development of the project, five European companies participate in it.
These are French company Engie, OMV from Austria, British-Dutch company Royal Dutch Shell as well as Wintershall and Uniper from Germany.
In a conversation with Welt am Sonntag, a representative of the latter company said that U.S. efforts to undermine "an important infrastructure project" were a clear intervention in the sovereignty of European countries.
Earlier this week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed an amendment to the National Defense Act designed to expand U.S. sanctions against companies involved in the installation of the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
According to one of the movers of the Act, the resources can be directed towards companies that pay for or provide a ship, insurance, port facility or connection service for such ships, as well as those that offer certification for Nord Stream 2.
Both European companies and public officials have reiterated their disapproval of the United States' attempts to interfere with European energy by applying sanctions against Nord Stream 2, and some have even called for Brussels to work on data-driven measures.
Moscow officials have also harshly criticized the operation from Washington, calling it unfair competition.
Earlier this week, the spokesman for the presidency, Dmitry Peskov, said that Russia would come up with a new plan on how the project will be completed if Washington officials keep the new sanctions to a halt.
Preparing for further transport of public institutions to land
The Minister for Social Affairs and Children intends to move more public institutions out of the country in the near future.
The Department of Housing and Civil Engineering will move north to Sauárkrók this fall at the Minister's decision, but experts within the department have previously stated that they do not intend to move livestock north.
Asmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children, said in Explosives on the Wave this morning that it was important for the countryside that public institutions are transferred there.
There is also a lot of value creation that also creates diversity.
“It’s important, we’re trying to build everything around the country.
Employment structure, currency-creating structure, whether in tourism, agriculture, industry, some form of natural exploitation, and this type of work as a public job, they are very supportive of that structure," says Asmundur.
“Creating increased diversity, creating better foundations for this resource exploitation and currency creation of the nation.”
Asmund's decision to move the fire-fighting area of the Housing and Civil Engineering Institute has been heavily criticized by its employees and the National Association of Firefighters and Medical Transporters.
Six men who have expertise in firefighting and work in the department are all living in the capital area and none of them intend to move to Sauárkrók.
"I think it's clear that there are political differences of opinion as to how hard to go about this.
My view is, and always has been, that we should engage in radical measures to better distribute the public works," says Asmund.
“We see that our neighbours, the Norwegians and Danes have been doing this successfully.”
He says he is convinced that the vast majority of the people want to see more distribution in public institutions around the country.
“I think we need to make more political decisions about moving public services out of the country, just like I did with the Housing and Human Resources Agency.”
He takes an example of the transfer of the Icelandic Food Agency on Selfoss, Iceland’s Land Survey to Akraness and Unemployment Insurance on Skagaströnd.
“There’s a lot of work going on today that’s important to this community.
I think we need to take another step in this direction.”
“I’m taking another step in this direction.
Further transportation."
Five arrested in Seattle
Systematic racism and the decision by the President of the United States to send federal police forces to cities to dismiss riots were widely protested yesterday.
A fifth of the protesters were arrested in Seattle.
Seattle police used flare bombs and pepper spray in a crowd protest there yesterday, which police have described as rioting.
21 policemen were injured and at least 45 protesters were arrested.
Two months have passed since a protest against systematic racism began in the United States after a policeman killed George Floyd.
There was a blow to the protests to show protestors in Portland solidarity.
There have been repeated fierce clashes between police and protesters after the U.S. President sent troops of federal police officers, who have driven around on unmarked cars, to unappreciated authorities.
Thousands gathered in Portland over the weekend, using police tear gas and rubber bullets when clashing between them and protesters.
I had a miracle child at 47.
U.S. reality star Kenya Moore is doing well by empowering people in need of tech fertilization.
Moore, who is known for his participation in The Real Housewives of Atlanta, had his first child at the age of 47 after tech fertilization and calls his daughter the miracle baby.
“Almost my whole life I waited to have a baby,” Moore told People.
“So I know the anxiety that people feel, especially women, thinking that I might not be able to have a child.”
Moore realized she was running out of time when she turned 40.
“I didn’t want to have a child.
I didn’t want to be a single mother.
So I waited and after forty, I looked up and thought to my God," said Moore, who did not meet her father-in-law until she was 46.
A year later, they had a daughter.
The reality star says her daughter is a miracle child in more ways than one.
In addition to Moore being older than most of the originals, her daughter came into the world a month and a half before the set date.
Moore went to an imperial section, which proved difficult and took much longer than a traditional imperial section.
"I call it a miracle burn because it was a child that everyone said there was almost no chance for me to have," Moore said in the interview.
Fathers arrested in Mizoram with a face value of 15.4 million rupees of heroin
The heroin's worth at home market was about 15.5 million rupees, and so was smuggled from Myanmar, according to police
A man and his son were arrested with 1.9 kg of heroin in the Hnahthial district of Mizoram, near the border with Myanmar, police were reported on Sunday.
The heroin's worth at home market was about 15.5 million rupees, and so was smuggled from Myanmar, according to police.
Duhkima (62) and his son Remthangpuia (33) were arrested with the drugs on Friday night in the village of Ngharchhip, police said.
They also lost about 280 grams of heroin, worth about 1.5 million rupees, when they swam across, on their escape from police, as noted by the office.
According to police, this is believed to be one of the largest quantities of heroin ever seized in the state.
The defendants were prosecuted under the relevant articles of the Drugs and Narcotics Act (NDPS) of 1985.
Even though the border between the states and Myanmar is closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, there is no passing of drugs and other commodities, according to police.
Assam riflemen recently seized 25 trucks loaded with betel nuts smuggled from Myanmar, worth about 40 million rupees.
The doctor ran 35 miles with a mask
British doctor Tom Lawton ran 35 miles with a face mask to show that oxygen saturation did not decrease with the use of a face mask.
Lawton is a doctor at Bradford Royal Hospital and has worked there during the pandemic.
To disprove the theory of oxygen saturation and to encourage people to wear a face mask, Lawton decided to run to work and back with a mask.
Prior to his departure, he founded a collection of GoFundMe for The Trusell Trust, which handles food donations in Bradford and across the UK.
“I’m a big supporter of everything that keeps us safe.
That's why I've been shocked by the wrong information that has been received between people that face masks reduce oxygen saturation in people," Lawton said.
Lawton said that he had previously competed in three races, but while the pandemic was raging, his toleration had diminished.
On Monday, he ran 35 miles.
“I never took off my mask (no food or drink) and my oxygen saturation level was 98% every time I looked,” Lawton wrote on Twitter.
Prince Joakim still in hospital
Prince Joakim of Denmark is now located at the University Hospital in Toulouse, France, and his condition is stable.
The prince underwent brain surgery yesterday after being diagnosed with a blood clot.
“The situation of Prince Joakim is still stable.
The Prince was blessed by professionals in time and feels comfortable after events.
It is too early to say how long he will be in the hospital at this moment," says Lene Balleby, an information officer for the Danish royal palace, in a written reply to Danish state radio.
Only a few days have passed since the royal family celebrated the 18th birthday of Prince Felix, his second son.
The birthday was celebrated at the Queen's vineyard, the Chateau de Cayx in Cahors, southern France.
The family was still there on vacation when Joakim was admitted to the hospital yesterday.
Joakim, aged 51, moved to France last year where he is studying at the military school Ecolé Militaire, the first Dana.
He works as a defence expert at the Danish Embassy in Paris.
The prince's relationship with France is strong, as is his late father, Prince Henry, French, and his wife, Princess Mary.
Sells the apartment she's been living in for 30 years
Actress Susan Sarandon has sold her home in New York City.
Saradon has lived in the apartment for the past 30 years and raised all his children there.
The house that her Sarandon apartment is was built for World War I and is in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.
The price of the property is a small $7.9 million or just over one billion Icelandic króna.
The apartment is 560 square meters and is on the 7th and 8th floor of the house.
Sarandon bought the house originally in 1991 with her ex-husband, Tim Robbins.
When they divorced in 2011, Sarandon was given the house.
Sarandon and Robbins had Jack and Miles together, for whom she had a daughter Eve.
All three children grew up in the apartment.
It has six bedrooms, five and a half bathrooms.
The apartment is bright and beautiful and exceptionally beautifully decorated.
A plane crash in Utah killed a child and two adults in a backyard crash
Six people were aboard a Piper PA-32 plane that crashed in a backyard in the city of West Jordan on Saturday afternoon, according to Allen Kenitzer, a spokesman for the United States Aviation Administration (FAA).
Three of those on board died, including the 43-year-old pilot Lee Wyckoff, his 9-month-old child, and Milda Shibonis, 36, according to police authorities in West Jordan.
The pilot's wife is in danger of death and a 2-year-old child has a severe burn wound.
A 12-year-old girl was treated and discharged from a nearby hospital, said Jennifer Worthen, a spokesman for the West Jordan Police Department, in an interview with CNN on Sunday.
A 72-year-old woman who was in a house that was hit by the plane is in danger of death, according to a Twitter post from the police department on Sunday.
Three houses were also damaged in the crash, according to Tauni Barker, a spokesman for West Jordan City.
The cause of the crash has not been determined.
The case is being investigated by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Accident Investigation Board (NTSB).
Gottlieb warns that the non-stop spread of the coronavirus in a community is making it "very difficult" for schools to open this fall
Washington – Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, warned on Sunday that it will be "very difficult" for a school district to open in a new academic year if the coronavirus spreads without delay within these communities.
“I think the school authorities need to look at the distribution within the community.
If the virus spreads unhindered in the community, it will be very difficult to open in that condition," said Gottlieb in "Face the Nation".
As the fall semester is due to begin in the coming weeks, the Trump administration had urged school authorities to open their schools to students and offer tuition at the schools five days a week.
However, these efforts by President Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos come a week after Trump warned that the coronavirus epidemic would likely "worse before it improves" and confirmed that school districts in the places where the situation is worst may have to postpone school opening for a few weeks.
Nevertheless, the Centers for Disease Control issued guidelines on Thursday on how the safest way to open a school to students was to open a school.
Among other things, the guidelines call for distance between people in schools to be guaranteed, for students and staff to be advised to use face protection, and for students to be divided into defined groups to reduce the number of transmission routes.
However, the Centers for Disease Control did not issue criteria for school administrators as to when they should close schools if coronavirus infections go up, which Gottlieb says has been "unfortunate".
“As this uncertainty reigns and detailed instructions have not been given on how schools will be opened, I think more parents will be careful,” he says.
“That’s why I think it’s very important to get accurate information about what the metrics are exactly, which the disease prevention centers didn’t provide in their guidelines.”
Gottlieb said school districts must think about the proportion of positive infections in the community, local spread and testing capacity when making decisions about whether to keep schools open or switch entirely to online teaching.
If between 5 and 10% of analyses yield a positive result, "the issue is going to be a problem" but over 10% is the "threshold when careful consideration needs to be given to whether to close the school districts."
"This is a sign that the epidemic has gained a foothold in the community," said Gottlieb, adding that this would make parts of the state of Florida, which is the center of the coronavirus epidemic in the United States, difficult to open for school instruction next month.
Coronavirus infections have increased in more than 30 states and the Colombian region, while the epidemiologic center of the epidemic is currently located in the solar belt on the southern coast of the United States.
However, Gottlieb said there was evidence that there had begun to slow the increase in cases in some states, including Arizona and Texas.
However, despite Gottlieb's saying that there were "clear signs" that the epidemic was beginning to slow in some states in the solar belt, the "heat in the coals" is beginning to "heat" in others, including South Carolina, Alabama, Indians, and Illinois.
Many governors have enacted rules obliging people to use masks in public spaces and halting phased reopening to counteract the spread of the coronavirus.
Gottlieb said that states should consider closing bars, limiting the number of people in restaurants, closing cinemas and other places that offer indoor entertainment, and setting rules on masking to overcome the epidemic, which are measures that allow states to avoid resuming the strict restrictions imposed in the beginning of the epidemic.
In addition to the mandatory use of masks by various states, various companies have required people to use face protection.
McDonald's is the newest company to make use of face protection mandatory, so it is added to a group of companies such as Walmart, Starbucks and others that have set their own rules for masking.
Gottlieb said he expected more companies to take up a mask duty with him, especially since the risk is considered high.
“If we can really control the epidemic as winter progresses until we get a vaccine or some kind of treatment that changes the clinical process of this disease then we can do it with masks, it’s relatively simple, something that we can all do but that doesn’t directly change our lives and allows us to keep what’s very important to us, like keeping it open to some of us.”
Although Donald Trump last week said he did not want to make masking a duty throughout the country, he urged Americans last week to use face protection, saying at a White House press conference that "they had an impact".
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson: 'It's tidings to be expected'
Crystal Palace's supporters received a plaque for the summer when Roy Hodgson, the club's manager, declared the applicant's insolence Wilf Zaha wanted to leave the club.
The elephant striker has been playing at Selhurst Park for more than five years and now appears to be on the move, but he has previously been spoken to by teams such as Arsenal and Bayern Munich.
As he is now 27 years old, it is yet to be revealed whether a team of that quality is still willing to pay high sums for him, especially during the financial uncertainty of the sport this summer, after a season in which Zaha scored four goals and made five assists for a Palace team that caused some disappointment.
In an interview with Alex Crook at TalkSport after the last game of the season, Hodgson said that "news was to be expected" regarding Zaha's possible departure after confirming that the applicant had "clearly stated" that he saw his future elsewhere than at the club.
There are still three years left of the petitioner's contract with Palace, and last year the company indicated that 100 million sterling would be needed for the company to hand him over.
Hodgson's team finished the season with seven consecutive losses and a draw on the final day of the season, causing the team to drop to 14th place.
Zaha found the net mesh only once from mid-December to the end of the season with a long shot in a loss against Chelsea.
He was reported to have asked for a sale last summer as he tried to get out of the club, but no offer was received to tempt Palace to sell.
Zaha changed his agent in January, apparently to increase his chances of leaving the club, and over the next few weeks it will no doubt be his priority to secure a social change.
Zaha is the player who played the most minutes in the English Premier League for Palace during the season and was the team's only player under the age of 28 to play 1100 minutes or more, showing how much rebuilding of the team might be necessary with the funds available for the player.
Hurricane Hanna: Coronavirus-stricken Texas State Faces High Risk of Disaster Floods in 'Double Shield'
Weather reporters have predicted "a disaster flood" in southern Texas after Hurricane Hanna hit the country twice, resulting in heavy rains and wind gusts of up to 40 feet per second.
By the time he reached the coast on Saturday, he was classified as a first-degree storm (the lowest point on a five-point scale) and he has now been brought down to a tropical storm, but rain could still reach 150-300 mm on Sunday and wind could reach 26 metres in seconds.
In some areas, rain has already reached as much as 230 mm, including in Cameron County on the Mexican border.
Hanna was the first hurricane of the Atlantic hurricane season in 2020, and meteorologist Chris Birchfield advised residents to be well on guard: “This is not nearly over yet. We are still expecting disaster floods.”
Over the past few weeks, Texas has faced a huge increase in coronavirus infections.
Governor Greg Abbott issued a disaster report for 23 counties that will be on the road of the storm, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston, and Brazoria.
“All hurricanes are a huge challenge.
This challenge is complex and even more difficult as the hurricane passes through an area that has become worst off due to COVID-19," said Greg.
The hurricane first arrived on land at 5:00 p.m. on Saturday, 24 miles north of Port Mansfield, which is about 210 miles south of Corpus Christi.
The second time was not far from, in eastern Kennedy County.
More than 43,700 people in South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen, and Brownsville, were without power Saturday night.
Emergency services in Corpus Christi set up parks near intersections to allow them to be used if there is much flooding across streets.
US President Donald Trump said in a tweet that the government was monitoring Hannah and Hurricane Douglas, which was heading towards Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean.
Sherry Boehme, who lives on the beach in Corpus Christi, said the storm approaching had heightened the anxiety she felt as a result of the pandemic.
This 67-year-old woman had remained mostly at home due to health problems associated with chronic lung disease.
She said: “It’s almost like a double hit for us.
I think a lot of people are unsettled.
We'll get through this.
They’re all good and strong and stand together.”
Immersion on a bluesy voyage to the South
The weather in the south of Iceland has been unusually good this summer, as the weather has been favourable to farmers.
Most are finished with the first stroke, the second stroke is widely started and then it is expected that someone will reach the third stroke at the end of the summer.
The weather has been playing with Sunni farmers like other residents of the region this summer and not spoiling the run for on the farmyards.
The hearing has gone well.
Sigurdur Augustsson, a cow farmer in Birtingaholt in Hrunamannahreppur and a developer in haystacks is happy and happy.
“Yeah, it’s just been really good, I think the farmers must just be steep, it’s been going really well, it’s been really good weather for the last six months.
The food is very good and the quality of the food is very good," says Sigurd.
Sigurd says that it moves in growth, not least in cow farmers that they breed in flat pits or conditions, which have been very successful, but there is by far the most to be done in the rolling haystack.
"It's very lively, yes, it's actually been very comfortable now for the last six months or three weeks, it's been so dry and good and then it's so comfortable to deal with this.
It remembers everything, there is less stress and can be stored until morning sometimes what could be done today, so it is brilliantly comfortable.
Did you know that some farmers are going to make it three times?
“Yes, I could believe it, the first ones.
We started on June 17th, it could be that those who were first have to take three things."
The Wolf's Solution - How to Prevent Injuries
Edgeman Adama Traoré, who plays with Wolves in the English league, is an extremely fast player.
His opponents have had it in their hands to make sure he can’t get past them.
As a result, his shoulders have fallen off several times, but now the wolves have come up with a solution to the problem.
The Sun knows about it.
In Wolves' game against Crystal Palace, a paramedic could be seen smearing something on the shoulders of Traoré.
"This is something we had to do to protect Traoré," says a source within Wolves, but what was being carried on him was baby oil.
"Making him more slick makes it harder for defenders to catch him and that way we can prevent further injuries."
Traoré's shoulders first fell off the team when Wolves played against Tottenham in December.
Since then, the shoulder has dropped out of the team four times, most recently against Sheffield United earlier this month.
Prince Harry of England: A friend of the Duke of Sussex protests claims in a new book that has been between the teeth of people
Stott said in a conversation with Sky News that the content of the book about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was in no way different from the content of the gossip magazines, the only difference being that the book was hardcover.
The former soldier wants the sea to be increasingly focused on the positive contributions that those couples have made, such as their charitable work.
Stott said, "I think what's out there is no different from what we read in the gossip magazines, except just now in a hardcover book."
“There’s a story out there, there’s no way it’s coming from them.”
“I think it’s just another attack on them, just like the gossip magazines that are persecuting them.”
“I realize they’re in the spotlight and people want to know what they’re doing, but I wish it was more about all the good they’ve done and their charity, rather than their personal issues.”
“They’ll never get away with it, of course.”
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's support overshadowed other members of the royal family, according to an expert in the history of the royal family.
Dr Kate Williams told Sky News that the royal family had failed to exploit Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's star popularity for their benefit.
She added that the order of power within the royal family was fixed, but that the weight of public interest could not be controlled.
She also said: "The fact is that everything they did in support of the Queen tended to overshadow other members of the royal family, and this was seen as a problem."
“They are very popular.”
"They had less weddings than most of the siblings in the same position, Andrew had a huge wedding, Anne had a huge wedding, too."
“But even though Harry and Meghan’s wedding was smaller in size than William and Catherine’s, it was just as much newscasting because of the global interest in the couple.”
Donald Trump admits he often regrets his tweets
Donald Trump has admitted that he often regrets his posts on Twitter that fueled a war.
In an interview with Barstool Sports on Friday, the President of the United States said that his unchecked replays of Twitter posts – some of which have contained content from white racists – would get him into the most trouble.
When journalist Dave Portnoy asked him if he regretted his posts, Trump replied: “Often, too often.
It was so in the old days, before this came, that you wrote a letter and said that this letter was very big.
You put it on your desk and then you came back the next day and said, "Oh, how I'm glad I didn't send this," right?
But we don’t do it on Twitter.
We send it out right away, we feel great and then you start getting calls – “Did you really say that?”
I say, "What's the matter?" and you find out.
Last month, Trump caused a lot of anger after relaying an entry (shared content from another account) with a video of his supporters in the Villages area of Florida where an elderly couple called "White Power!" or "White Power!".
And in 2017, Trump reiterated three posts directed against Muslims, published by Jayda Fransen, leader of the right-wing Britain First party.
The president told Portnoy that the rebirths that had gotten him into the most trouble
Trump said: “You see something that looks good and doesn’t research it, you understand, and you don’t know exactly what’s on the helmet, which is tiny and you don’t grow it, sometimes – I’ve found that it’s almost always the flashbacks that get you in trouble.”
The president often shares praise for himself, raves about his opponents, and conspiracy theories with 80 million of his followers on Twitter.
Trump says Twitter is helping him get through the so-called "fake news" on TV shows and newspapers, which he says is permeated with falsehood.
But the president’s own lies have often found their way under the microscope, and now Trump’s tweets are misleading.
The GPS system may be unsafe
Many states are working to establish a location technology other than the GPS system.
An engineering associate professor says there may be a reason to worry about the security of the GPS system, which is owned by the United States Army.
The old Loran system has gone into a renewal of life.
The GPS technology accompanies us with every footing.
We use it when flying, sailing and driving, in surveying, in industry and leisure.
Most people think of it as a military device owned by the United States Army, which first opened it to general use in the 1980s.
GPS technology uses coordinates from a satellite at an altitude of 20,000 kilometers above the ground, and therefore conditions in nature have little effect on it.
“It’s very easy to disturb her.
And malicious people can easily interfere with the reception of these signals,” says Sæmundur E. Þorsteinsson, Associate Professor of Engineering at the University of Iceland and expert on risk management and telecom safety.
He also says it's easy to send an error mark with the wrong location, for example, in warfare.
“The GPS system is owned by the U.S. Department of Defense.
They have assured the public that the system is in place at all times.
But surely they can turn this off if it pushed into the head of a very eccentric president to have such a thing done, then he could probably do it," says Sæmundur.
Therefore, many states have begun to consider other systems and location technology.
Both Russia and China operate their own satellite systems, and the European Union is launching the Galileo location system.
“The Galileo system is primarily built for civilian use.
It has perhaps more precision and is naturally under the control of the European Union.
It is not just one government that controls it, but many,” says Sæmundur.
But many are also starting to look back at the old loran technique.
It is based on radio waves and was used from the 1960s until GPS technology took over.
The Loran signals are transmitted on very long waves from transmitters on the ground.
“It is then a new version of the Loran system called eLoran, which stands for Enhanced Loran, men are seriously considering it in many countries to have it as a system to spare, because it must be a bit different laws to interfere with it, it is much more difficult than interfering with a satellite system,” says Sæmundur.
However, it is probably safest to have access to most location systems.
Former MP Vern Buchanan has died of the coronavirus.
"Gary was a professional forward in fingerpicking and a loyal servant of the public," Buchanan said on Facebook.
He touched the lives of so many and was loved and admired by those who knew him.
I will never forget how uplifting he was, the sense of humor and the singular joy he got from helping others."
Buchanan's office released a statement in a tweet earlier this month stating that Tibbetts had not had any recent dealings with others in the office.
Tibbetts, who served outside the office, had been working for Buchanan since 2011.
The state of Florida has reported 414,511 cases since the beginning of the pandemic, which is more than the 411,200 cases in New York, according to health authorities in the states.
State health authorities data show that hospital admissions have increased by 79% since U.S. National Day, July 4.
The data also shows that at least 50 intensive care units in Florida reached tolerance levels on Saturday.
"We were informed that this could have an impact," DeSantis said in June.
“At the same time, police work and imposing sanctions could have the opposite effect.”
Fly from Hornafjörður to Cape Town
Turkey pigeons, roosters, ring pigeons, crossbills, canopies, and weepingbirds are among the birds that have flocked to this country this summer.
On the website of the Bird Observatory of Southeast Iceland you can almost daily see brief news about the wanderers, where they have been seen and sometimes their breed.
There are a lot of bird lovers in Iceland.
This includes a large number of people who like the Facebook page Icelandic bird species.
The members of the group number about 14,600.
It shares images of birds and it is obvious that Iceland is rich in good photographers who have the patience to make birds.
Brynjulfur Brynjólfsson is one of them.
Binni, as he is known, is an employee of the Southeastern Bird Observatory and the Southeastern Nature Center, and closely monitors the bird life in that area.
He speaks beautifully about these animals that enrich the life of Iceland and play an important role there, and it does not matter if the bird is a large and large bird of prey or a small sparrow.
The Bird Observatory was established in 2005 on the birthday of Half-Dance Björnsson at Kvískerir in Öræf with the aim of maintaining and continuing the significant nature studies he conducted since 1940.
“Half-dance was thirteen years old when he began to learn about birds,” says Brynjúlfur in a conversation with Kjarnan.
“We at the Bird Observatory are not doing exactly the same thing Halfdan did, but we are building on his data by counting and marking birds.”
Halfdan was a farmer and universal scientist, born on March 14, 1927.
He wrote a number of scientific articles on plants, insects, and bird life.
He died on 10 February 2017, aged almost nine.
Half-dead and his siblings at Kvískerir aroused the interest of many whom they met in Icelandic nature.
That group includes Björn Gísli Arnarson, the "employee" of the Bird Observatory.
Bjorn grew up on Reynivallar in the South and received a rich natural appetite from his neighbour, Half-Dan at Kviskerir.
But what exactly is the South-Eastern Bird Observatory doing?
Around 20 March each year, the Bird Observatory sets up a special bird network in Einarslundi, a tree grove just outside Höfn in Hornafjörður.
There are standard markings on the birds that come into the nets.
The nets are taken down around May 10th when the lay time begins.
The internet is up every day, at least from about six o’clock in the morning until noon.
They need to visit every hour.
The birds in them are marked, measured, and then released back into freedom.
Every hour, a reporter asks.
“We’re going to share it with you and me.
Since we now have to work for us, this can be a considerable puzzle, but somehow we manage to do this," says Brynjúlfur.
The networks are then re-installed during the period August 1 to November 10 – every day as weather permits.
Between guarding the nets and during the periods when they are not up, Brynjúlfur and Björn are marking crits, scum and various moths as they reach them.
In addition, they take on a number of special tasks.
One of these projects is carried out in collaboration with the Icelandic Institute of Natural Sciences and is about collecting forest mites from birds.
“The forest mite jumps on the birds at their winter stations and then takes them to the country in the spring.
This happens shortly before they leave, which is why these ticks are not big when they come to Iceland.
Then he jumps off the bird and tries to find some other host when he needs it."
But enough about the mites.
Asked how the birds of the Southeast are doing this summer, Brynjúlfr says that the wreath of the crown seems to be doing well – as it is over the head of the wreath.
“The main cast of the crown is here at Hala in the South and everything is going well.
But there is no warp to be found anymore at Jökulsárlón, where a few years ago there was a huge warp."
He says that a few years ago there were over a thousand pairs of crowns, but that they can now be counted on the fingers of one hand.
“When we look at birds, I think it’s diminished in the last few years what you feel about them.
“But there’s always a change between years.”
What can explain this major change, according to Brynjólf, is most likely about the supply of food.
“It’s all about food.”
Then the work of men can also have its say on the progeny of birds and other animals.
But some birds seem to be doing well in the Southeast this summer.
“One of the things that I think is positive is that the number is increasing again after a lot of lows,” says Brynjúlfur, “but in the meantime the pressure has dropped terribly in the last few years and decades.”
From sparrows, it is reported that the marjoram seems to be going well in its nest this summer as it did last year.
Forest thrushes and duvet ticks had decreased somewhat, but Brynjúlfur says it will not be revealed until this fall how this summer has turned out for them.
But let’s get back to the scammers.
They often attract a lot of attention, especially if they are very rare and even colorful.
These two interesting features have one of the most popular twists of the summer: the Rosestar.
"Otherwise it has been relatively quiet in the summer in the wanderings," says Brynjúlfur, but mentions that in the countryside there are now grey doves and then doves have been seen and are beginning to nest here.
When Brynjúlfur and Björn get in touch with wanderers, they also mark them, just like other birds.
Meanings are international and they are practiced all over the world.
The markings include where the birds’ winter stations are, where they nest, and what their passages are.
“You can even see how long they’re on the move,” Brynjölfur points out.
This information is useful in many ways, to form when it comes to epidemics such as bird flu.
“The knowledge is always increasing.”
If anyone in the world finds a bird that has been tagged by the Southeast Bird Observatory, the information is sent to the Icelandic Institute of Natural Sciences.
“We’ve recovered everything from Cape Town in South Africa.
There was a box that we had marked.
One of our crayons was later found in the United States."
One bird is Brynjúlfi especially the mind and that is the scum.
“The screen is our bird,” he says, pointing out that the Bird Observatory and the Southeast’s Nature Center are tasked with monitoring his progeny – which has become quite sluggish and is now on the agenda.
It is difficult to say what caused a collapse in the stock, but one theory is that the scum has made itself a sea catch that was previously thrown by fishing boats and into the sea for good, but that it is now being used much better and it affects the scum.
Are you looking for the best place in the world to watch birds?
“You don’t naturally make me say no,” Brynjulf laughs, adding: “Since we’re also chasing stray birds, I guess we need to go further.”
But the Southeast is certainly special when it comes to bird life.
“This area is like being pulled into the country from Europe, but then the birds spread out from here.
Being here to see migratory birds and migratory birds is very interesting, but here there is less to be found of laying birds than in many other parts of the country.
It is not far from the fjord and to the glacier, so the area as such is well suited for bird observation."
What is your favorite bird?
He thinks for a moment before answering.
I find the question difficult.
“I’m a bird because I’ve found nine of the ten that have been seen on the land,” he replies.
“I think it’s a lot more fun to take pictures of horses.
So it’s always nice to find birds that haven’t been seen before in Iceland or are rare, so I’m not talking about finding a new species for Europe.”
But the two of them have done so.
If you want to better monitor the work of Binna and Bjössa at the Bird Observatory in Southeast Iceland, you can follow their work on Facebook and on the web Fuglar.is
Saudi Arabia – The sun beach of the future? No alcohol or bikini
The tourism industry has grown enormously around the world in recent years, and now authorities in Saudi Arabia want their share of the cake.
Imagine the authorities spend equivalent to about 60,000 billion ISK to create a tourist paradise in the country.
The Guardian reports on this.
But this tourist paradise will not be in the style that we Icelanders should get used to in the south of Europe.
Alcohol will not be available and women will not be allowed to sunbathe in bikinis.
But how to attract tourists to this strict Islamic country?
This is to be done, for example, by building a new city where there will be white beaches, moons (of course created by humans), drone rental cars, and robots that serve people.
The Guardian says it is Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia who wants to invest in this investment.
The money will of course be collected in the country’s oil reserves.
The Crown Prince says that it is not a matter of debate that women can avoid covering their shoulders and knees in public places, but at the same time admits that it is not a simple matter to create a tourist paradise in the country because it is too hot where the sun is high in the air and can not be relied on wind cooling.
However, you may wonder if it will also reduce the interest of future tourists if they cannot buy alcohol.
Francois Bozize, formerly deposed by the presidency of the Central African Republic, announces a presidential run
The former president of the Central African Republic, Francois Bozize, who had been deposed, announced on Saturday that he would present himself in the December presidential election despite the United Nations applying him sanctions and that an arrest warrant has been issued for his alleged crimes against humanity.
He announced his presentation in a speech before a large group of supporters at his party's congress, Kwa na Kwa ("work, only work"), in the capital of Bangui.
This 73-year-old former general and military commander was removed from power in 2013 in a rebellion by an alliance of mostly Muslim insurgents from the north who plunged the mostly Christian nation into a violent civil war and a severe and prolonged humanitarian crisis.
"The country needs a man with experience, peace and conviction," Bozize said in a speech critical of the current president's tenure, Faustin-Archange Touadera.
Bozize first took power after a coup in 2003 and held the presidency for 10 years before fleeing the country in 2013.
The new government sought to arrest him for alleged crimes against humanity and for inciting genocide, but he has not been arrested since his return from exile in late last year.
It is not clear how the arrest warrant or foreign sanctions affect its availability.
In January, Bozize said he would ask the United Nations to lift the sanctions imposed in 2014 over alleged support for armed Christian groups Anti-Balaka.
Touadera is leading the country today with the support of the extensive UN peacekeeping force that counts more than 13,000 military and police personnel.
He was elected in 2016 and is expected to run for a second term, but his candidacy has not been confirmed.
The first round of the election will be on December 27.
In February 2019, the government signed a peace agreement with 14 armed groups that usually claim to defend the interests of certain communities or religions.
Since then there have been fewer violent crimes, but there are still bloody incidents, usually caused by conflicts over resources, but the majority of this diamond-rich country is not under the control of the government.
The violence has forced more than 1.5 million people to flee their homes.
Gareth Bale's position at Real Madrid is 'unacceptable for everyone', says Toni Kroos
Toni Kroos, Real Madrid midfielder, says Gareth Bale's position at the Spanish team is "unacceptable for everyone".
Bale did not take part in any of the team's last seven games and he took little part in Los Blancos' LaLiga celebration, and this summer has come up with the pitfall that the player intends to stay and let his contract expire, but the club hopes he will disappear on track.
"There is no way to avoid the situation becoming unacceptable to everyone," said Kroos in the podcast Lauschangriff Endlich was mit Sport.
“He wasn’t bought to play as little as he is now.
I think he actually wanted to leave the club last summer and that the club actually said 'yes' but then said 'no' later.
I don't know if he's still a bit angry about that. It's a tough case."
When asked if the situation had had a negative impact on Real’s atmosphere, Kroos said: “Not as much as you might expect.
I’ve known him for six years and we’ve done some important things together.”
China to give 2,000 face masks to Reykjanesbær in support of the fight against the coronavirus
Chinese Ambassador Jin Zhijian handed the mayor of Reykjanes town two thousand face masks in the past week.
The occasion was the Mayor's visit to the Chinese Embassy on 22 July last.
The news broke first.
The mayor's reason for visiting was to repay the Chinese ambassador's visit to Reykjanesbær, where he visited the town hall and met with the mayor.
Vík news reports that there has been talk of strengthening a friendship between Reykjanesbær and Xianyang city, but the municipalities started their cooperation between 2014.
The gift, 2,000 face masks, is rooted in this friendly town partnership, but the city authorities in Xianyang wanted to give masks, thus supporting the fight against the coronavirus epidemic.
According to news reports, the masks will be used in sensitive establishments and workplaces in Reykjanesbær for both employees and other visitors who come there.
In addition to the flag of Iceland and the People's Republic of China, an inscription on the face mask box reads "Beer is who behind it, except brother is not."
Thompson wants to leave the KR - Counts on a reduction in wages
Tobias Thomsen is going to try to get home to Denmark, from the Icelandic champions KR, next month and says he feels an interest from partners in the Danish First Division.
Thomsen has played in Iceland since 2017 and has been champion of Iceland with both Val and KR.
However, this 27-year-old asylum seeker says he has begun to miss Denmark and wants to move there with his girlfriend, Stefania Jakobsdóttir.
Danan's contract with KR is valid until the end of this season, so it is clear that a Danish club would have to negotiate with KR for a purchase price to receive it in August, before a new season begins in Denmark.
Otherwise, Thomsen would have to wait until the winter to get to Denmark.
“Yes, I know that the Danish leagues will start again at the end of August.
It means of course that I would have to cancel my contract with KR-ings but I have told them that I miss Denmark, and they have a full understanding of it," Thomsen told bold.dk.
He added that he had a very good relationship with coach Rúnar Kristinsson, who would have shown the position full understanding, and Thomsen said he did not believe that the purchase price would be a big problem.
“I’ve also had conversations with two First Division clubs after that league was over and the teams knew where they were going to end up.
There has been a bit of interest already regarding the upcoming season so it may well be that I will go to Denmark before the Icelandic division leaves," said Thomsen, adding that it was clear that there are not many companies in Denmark that could buy up his contract with KR.
“It’s not clear now, but it’s been interesting.
I also need to find the best option for me and my girlfriend, who is from Iceland and comes with me.
This depends on a few things," said Thomsen, claiming to look primarily to Copenhagen.
Thomsen told KR-ings not to worry that he did not give himself all the training and games, even though he missed Denmark.
“KR knows what it gets from me and that’s that I do things 100 percent.
I can completely overlook the fact that I miss Denmark when I am in practice or in games," said Thomsen, who says clearly that he will lower his salary by leaving the Icelandic champions in the second-tier league of Denmark.
“I will probably have to reduce my salary a little bit, because of the coronavirus crisis that seems to have affected the Danish companies a little more than the Icelandic ones.
But I am also in education and one solution could be that a company provided me with a job.
Most of the members of the 1st Division have agreements with sponsors.
I'm learning sports management through the players' organization and I'm finishing my bachelor's degree," said Thomsen.
Thomsen has only been on KR's starting team in two games in the Pepsi Max division this season, but has been involved in five games and scored one goal.
He started 21 games for the team last year and scored seven goals.
KR is equal to Val at the top of the Pepsi Max league and has a good game, but the team will meet KA in Akureyri today.
Coping with the coronavirus on board a bus when a driver gets into a hot argument over a face mask
The video shows passengers and drivers on board an Arriva bus in Liverpool dealing with masking.
The driver is heard explaining to a woman that it is not in his business to tell passengers to wear a mask.
The driver said, “It’s not in my business to tell everyone who gets in the car to wear a mask.”
Witness said this about the incident: "A man and an older woman began to indulge her and a great controversy broke out."
“The driver had to get out of his seat and came to ask what was really going on and he told one woman that she wasn’t even wearing the mask right.”
"That woman then rushed out of the car and said she was going to report the incident."
Arriva’s spokesman said: “The safety of our customers and our employees remains a priority for us.
“Our customers are still required to wear masks when using public transport (exceptions apply).”
“Clear guidelines and labels for customers regarding this and all other distance rules are on board buses, on social media and on our website.”
A mask duty has been in effect in public transport since June 15.
More than 16.3 cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed worldwide.
More than 650,000 have died.
More than 9,900,000 people have recovered from the coronavirus worldwide.
Most cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed in the United States, or more than 4.3 million.
Octavia Spencer calls for Hollywood to hire people with disabilities more often in roles
The actress participates in a new effort to increase the participation of people with disabilities in the recreational sector.
The campaign is underway at the same time as 30 years have passed since the passing of the U.S. law on the rights of people with disabilities, which carries out on Sunday.
In the video, Spencer discusses the importance of people seeing themselves and their lives reflected in a realistic way on the screen.
“Nothing can replace personal experience and genuine appearances,” she says.
"That's why it's so important to hire a suitable actor in a suitable role."
Spencer discussed the effects she experienced from seeing skin-darkened people on screen when she was a little girl watching the episode "Good Times".
These, shown on CBS between 1974 and 1979, were created by Norman Lear and they paved the way as the first comedy shows to feature two parents both of African descent.
Anti-Hunger Organization Pushes Yoho to Side After Parliament House Incident
WASHINGTON (AP) – An independent Christian organization that wants to end hunger said on Saturday that they had asked Senator Ted Yoho to resign from the organization's board of directors, and that he had complied, after what they called a "attack" on Senator Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio-Cortez, a New York City Democrat, accused Yoho, a Florida Republican, of using low-key and male-friendly lameness when he rebuked her when they met on the steps of the House of Representatives last Monday.
Yoho claimed that he had not used the words quoted, but a reporter who witnessed the incident confirmed that the wording had been as it was described.
Bread for the World said in a statement that the organization's board of directors had met with Yoho on Friday and sought his resignation to "correct our commitment to standing with women and skin-deep people, domestically and globally, leading us towards a world of increased participation of all races and increased justice."
The website of Bread for the World states that their "communist voice" pressured Congress and government to end hunger in the country and globally.
“As Bread for the World is an independent Christian organization whose goal is to reduce hunger and poverty through solid public policies, the organization upholds the respect, dignity and concern that Jesus asks us to show when communicating with people in positions of power, wherever they are on the political spectrum,” the statement said.
"In our opinion, the recent actions and words of Senator Ted Yoho, reported in the media, do not reflect the moral requirements made to our board members."
At the time of processing the news, Yoho's spokesperson had not responded to the email with an offer of response.
In an extraordinary speech at the House of Representatives last Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez dramatically commented on the incident, directing her words against what she called a male-remnant culture as "congratulating violence and violent speech against women".
More than a dozen of her colleagues endorsed her statement that the incident was an example of all-too-common male behavior.
Yoho described the incident as a brief discussion of policy and that "none would have been bothered, bullied or attacked".
He said he regretted having shown a "relentless attitude".
The 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez is in her first season as a progressive congressman and has received both praise and laud for her clean-up.
The 65-year-old Yoho is one of the most conservative members of the House of Representatives, and he will be sitting in a holy stone after his fourth term.
Wait until the 98th minute of the final to score the first goal of the season
Jesse Lingard had not scored or retired in the English Premier League this season, until he scored against Leicester today in the 98th minute of the league's final round.
Lingard had not scored in the English Premier League since scoring twice against Cardiff in December 2018.
He came on as a substitute today for Manchester United when the team faced Leicester in a final for a Champions League seat.
When over seven minutes had passed the usual playing time, Lingard fouled the ball off Kasper Schmeichel's goaltender Leicester and scored an empty goal.
A long-awaited goal for Jesse Lingard.
Real Madrid players are exempt from the rules on quarantine
Zinedine Zidane and his disciples at Real Madrid will be able to face England in their second match at Manchester City, in the Champions League of Europe, without having to go to a two-week quarantine.
The British government has decided that tourists from Spain need to go to a two-week quarantine, in order to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
However, there are exceptions, as in the case of competitive teams at the highest level of sport.
This confirmed the Ministry of Sports at Sky Sports.
The Ministry states that the persons exempt from the rules will only be in restricted areas, for a closed door.
This applies to sports stars, judges, coaches, medical teams, and media professionals.
The Madriders can therefore face Manchester City on 7 August without having to stay long in England, but they are 2-1 under in the duel after losing at Santiago Bernabeu on 26 February.
The winning team will advance to the 8-point finals taking place in Portugal.
Raining and raining over the country over the weekend
From news of overcrowded hotels and camping areas to judge, in the least south, it is clear that Icelanders have been keen to travel domestically this summer.
Those who have landed have at the same time been very lucky with the weather and the weather forecasts DV on one issue that the summer has been just plain beautiful, so far at least.
But now it’s time for a shopping weekend that has been the biggest travel weekend of the year so far.
However, it is unclear how it will be this year, compared to other weekends, since it is now the case that events that in the ordinary year have drawn a large number of people to not be held.
Let’s take a national holiday as an example.
The weather, of course, will play a major role, but now there is an appearance of torrential rain throughout the country, but especially to the south and southwest.
The weather agency forecasts torrential rains from Thursday night and at least until Saturday night.
It should be noted that long-term predictions are not a sacred truth here in the northern Atlantic and can of course change.
Einar Sveinbjörnsson, a meteorologist, says in his prediction of his weather web, Bliku, that the weekend of shoppers is to be expected.
He says: A draught in the atmosphere with associated cold that too often also reaches down to the surface, leads to the fact that when warmer air from the southwest tries to approach, only a depression is formed with wind and precipitation.
Of course also warmer air that 'moves' here north over.
Einar publishes his prediction map in support, saying: “A small wave from America is transmitted to the east and with it a summery air.
As it approaches, it reaches "flowering" in the form of a lowering air pressure and a perceived summer drop."
The large prediction model, the European computational center on the left of the map, and the U.S. GFS prediction on the right are somewhat congruent with this trend.
According to the forecast, the trail will cross late on Thursday and early on Friday with sharp A-way and rain on most of the country.
The lay center of about 985 hPa is then followed.
This time, there is some warm air in the North and East on Saturday and even Sunday as well.
However, it could blow the joint.
A man seriously injured is a car with cattle rolled in Wexford
A man was seriously injured in a traffic accident earlier today at the Ferrycarrig Bridge in Wexford.
A cattle truck rushed to the bridge and rolled over to a manless stationary car.
The 34-year-old driver suffered serious injuries in the accident, which occurred at around 13:50 today.
He was taken to the hospital in Wexford, where he lies heavily held.
The police technical department is investigating the scene and the bridge has been closed and bypasses have emerged.
A number of cattle were killed in the collision.
The police encourage anyone travelling by road from 13:45 to 14:00, as well as others who were in the area and may have witnessed the incident, to contact the Wexford Police Station on telephone 053 916 5200, the police's confidential telephone at 1800 666 111 or another police station.
Law and Order all the way to New York
"I was shot in it as you get such a childhood shot," says Birna Hrönn Björnsdóttir of Marisku Hargitay, the lead actress of the show Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
She was so captivated by the actress that she came to the scene of the show and waited for her for hours together, just to be able to say hi.
Like many Icelanders, Birna Hrönn Björnsdóttir, owner of Pink Iceland, watched Law and Order: Special Victims Unit from the turn of the century.
Birna tells the story of her encounters with the actress in the episode Love Stories on Channel 1.
When Birna was a teenager herself, at the age at which many people begin to develop an overconfident love shot, she did not experience it as her peers did because she was in the strictest position to suppress her own feelings.
She pretended to be interested in boy bands and young magical heartbreakers from movies, but did not have it at all.
“I was cutting out pop magazines and hanging pictures on the wall of Backstreet Boys and Jared Leto.
But there was nothing behind it, it was just me hiding that I was a lesbian."
She says that sometimes it is said that when people come out of the closet, they go through a late burst.
“We spend our teenage years suppressing these youth motivations, these shots, and so on.
I think that was one of the things that drew me to her," says Birna about the actress.
“There was something about her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm and I was just shot in her shoes."
The actress was born in New York City a few years ago.
One of her best friends, Erlingur Øttar Thoroddsen, was shooting a movie in that city and got Birna and their friend, Gunnar Helga Guðjónsson, to help with the filming.
“We were working on 30 people and spending a lot of time with strangers.
This is a naturally intimate atmosphere when you spend such a long time together every day so there was talk of everything and nothing."
One day, it turns out that he’s a big fan of Marijuana.
One woman on the camera says her friend is familiar with the actress because he was on the camera team of the show.
Unable to stop thinking about that fact, Birna regularly asks her new friend how her friend likes to work with the actress and whether Birna can get to meet her.
"She tells me to stop, she doesn't know if she can let that happen," says Birna.
When the film is finally finished, the group toasts and Birna tries for the last time to convince the woman to try to get the meeting around.
“She’d had a few drinks and said she’d just do it.”
A few days later, Birna sends the woman a message and asks if anything is going on in the case.
The woman does not answer and Birna decides to give up.
One morning she wakes up with a long message.
I look at the phone and scream.
Gunnar Helgi wakes up with a scream and I say: I have to take a shower and I have to make myself nice and go down to town."
The woman had then written to Birna that her friend, actors, and filming team Law and Order were present in a hotel in Times Square.
“I don’t know when they start or when they stop, but this is the name of the hotel, good luck,” says the message, and Birna dresses up in a hurry. She asks in the reception where the shooting takes place and takes the elevator to the 45th floor where the group is gathered.
Birna gets up and waits until a woman in the staff comes to her and asks this uninvited woman if she can help.
“I said I was looking for Jason and asked the woman to tell him that Birna from Iceland had arrived.”
When the friend finally arrives, he looks at Birna in amazement and asks how she got all the way to the set, as it was supposed to be a strict security guard.
Birna explains that she has now just taken the elevator and asks to meet Mariska.
“Yes, I don’t know.
Sit here," says the friend and Birna tullir.
He sits next to her and they start talking.
“I say to him, ‘I’m a fan, but you?’ ” says Birna.
“I played it like it was the most normal thing in the world.
Time is running out and the bear is waiting.
The actors appear regularly when a break is made, they get a snack and Birna looks around and searches for Mariska who is nowhere to be seen.
At last the friend comes and tells her that he is sorry to leave.
She asks him to get into the hands of another employee, but he doesn’t want her to leave immediately.
Surprisingly, the friend agrees and reaches for another employee.
"He comes with another friend and says, 'This is the woman from Iceland who would like to meet Marisku.'
Then he goes.
After two hours of waiting, the new friend comes running to Birna.
He said, “Quick.
These are unusual circumstances today, there are journalists with her so she will not stop.
She takes the most direct route in a car with them so you have to take the chance and go down and find her trailer.
It's white and it's white.
Hurry up.”
"So I look to the right and lose my face" Bear rushes off and takes the elevator down to Times Square.
There she finds about forty caravans, some marked and some not.
However, she does not find Mariska's bike house, and then despair begins to creep in.
“I feel the pain because I’ve spent half a day doing this, but I’m thinking, ‘Well, I tried.’
It was fun."
Vondauf holds Birna back towards the hotel where she looks in through the window the camera crew looks at her with spring eyes, realizing that Birna did not succeed in her intention work.
The bear accepts the fate and it begins to rain.
“I’m going under a shelter to cover myself from the rain.
Then I look to the right and lose my face."
No one but Mariska Hargitay stood there in the pantsuit she wears in the show, and Birna knew her way around – but Birna could hardly move with emotion.
“I look at my body and my hands and I think now you have to move.
Now you have to go to her.”
Bear does so and summons himself to tap the actress's shoulder.
She looks at me and I can’t say anything.
But I just say hello and say hello," recalls Birna.
“I’m from Iceland and I’m a big fan.
She said, “It’s great to meet you.”
The conversation didn't go much further because Mariska's car is there and it's whistled at her.
Mariska turns to Birna and says, “I have to go, but it was really nice to meet you.”
Bear bids farewell to the idol, watches the car drive away and then collapses.
“I called Erling and Gunna and they thought it wasn’t working.
But I was weeping with excitement and joy.
I said yes, you have to meet me now.
Then we toasted in soda water and tequila," says Birna.
She doesn't regret anything though she admits she probably wouldn't repeat the game.
“It’s like this once in a lifetime, spending so much time and energy to make it happen.
I’m always going to be a fan of this woman.”
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Birna Hrönn Björnsdóttir in the episode Love Stories on Channel 1.
The police did not spread the virus.
There is no reason to worry that the coronavirus can be transmitted by alcohol meters used by the police.
This is what a police officer in the police traffic department in the capital area says in a conversation with mbl.is.
Tips have been received, among other things, from people who are concerned that the same mouthpiece is being used for all drivers when the police approach, place themselves on a traffic street and let everyone who has a way through blow.
Police say they are taking care of the clean-up.
"It's not really a special mouthpiece, but we do recommend a cup that people blow into," a police officer said.
“Some people want to put their hands on it, but we’re instructing people to keep a little distance, up to a few inches.”
He asked if it was enough, the officer said.
If it turns out to be positive, the police use a different measure.
It has a mouthpiece, but it comes from a sealed plastic bag and is only used once.
The abdomen: Among other things, anise can be infused to reduce pain
The relationship with depression is not a coincidence.
Individuals suffering from intestinal inflammation, a disease characterized by abdominal pain, cramps, temblor, wind, constipation, and diarrhea, often experience anxiety and depression, which can lead to worsening symptoms according to the United States Anxiety and Depression Association (ADAA).
“This is because the colon is partially controlled by the nervous system, which responds to stress,” explains ADAA.
If the temperature is not reduced, there may be food intolerance.
Judge tries to stop ruling that children be released from immigration authorities
In his ruling on Saturday, Judge Dolly Gee invalidated the expected deadline by saying that immigration and tolling authorities in the United States do not need to release children if it cannot be done by any of the three means described in her previous directive.
However, Gee also stressed in his directive that immigration and tolly authorities still had a duty to release the children without undue delay.
The three routes proposed by Gee are to have families detained by immigration and tolling authorities freed together, to place children in the hands of a responsible person, or to have families freed from federal court orders.
Shalyn Fluharty, director of the agency Proyecto Dilley which provides legal services to families, condemned the decision, saying it was in the hands of immigration and tolly authorities to decide whether to continue to have children in custody.
"The main thing I feel is that children are being held indefinitely and they don't get out unless the immigration and tolling authorities approve it or families agree to be disassembled," Fluharty said.
Families are held at three locations of immigration and customs authorities in Berks, Pennsylvania, South Texas (Dilley), and Karnes County, Texas.
The children in these places are between the ages of 1 and 17 according to lawyers and representatives who provide legal assistance.
Gee, who oversees the implementation of the Flores Convention on the Care of Children in Custody, said in June that since "rules on masking and social distance would not be followed or badly followed" it would be urgent to move children from these establishments.
969 people detained by immigration and customs authorities have been diagnosed with the coronavirus and are in solitary confinement or surveillance as of July 23, according to immigration and customs authorities.
Of these, 25 are confirmed cases in Karnes, one in Dilley and two in detention centres for families.
In total, more than 3,700 cases have been confirmed in detention
I will look into the independence of the board.
The Prime Minister does not say it is abnormal that pension funds set standards in their investment policy on the rights of working people.
The Governor’s comments on the need to ensure the independence of pension fund directors, possibly by law, will be considered.
After Icelandair broke off negotiations with the Icelandic Airline Association and dismissed all flight attendants, the board of VR announced that the board of directors appointed by VR to the Board of Directors of the Icelandic Merchants’ Pension Fund was shunning or voting against the pension fund’s participation in the upcoming share issue of Icelandair.
Ragnar Thor Ingólfsson, chairman of VR, said that the board members would be replaced if they did not comply with the recommendations.
Ragnar Thor withdrew his statement three days later and so did the board of VR.
Asgeir Jónsson, Governor of the Central Bank, said in the news on Friday that the independence of pension fund directors needed to be ensured in the fund’s approvals and possibly through a legislative amendment.
Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir says it is important that pension fund directors are independent, but already believe it is guaranteed by law.
"Now the Governor of the Central Bank, who is of course going with the Financial Supervisory Authority, who has to do with this, has said that it needs to look specifically at the regulatory framework around this independence, we will of course take it into consideration if something needs to be reviewed there," she says.
Katrin says that according to the law, pension funds set themselves moral standards in their investment policy.
It is desirable that it address the social and moral norms that they want to emphasize in their investments.
“I don’t think it’s unusual for pension funds to set guidelines in their investment policy on the rights of working people.
But I think it is natural that such decisions are made through policy, not through individual investment decisions," says Katrin.
"The city's suffocating traffic jams at Ölfusárbrú," says the President of the City Council of Årborg.
Helgi S. Haraldsson, the president of the municipality of Årborg, says that traffic congestion, which is formed at Ölfusárbrú in Selfoss, is daily completely intolerable.
He hopes that a new bridge over Ölfusá will take place in the autumn.
Now that Icelanders are traveling around their country and there is heavy traffic on the country's highways, a daily traffic jam is created at Ölfusárbrú when drivers are on their way to Selfoss or through the municipality.
Long rows are formed at the edge and can take on the patience of the drivers to wait in a row.
“Yes, it’s absolutely intolerable, it’s a traffic jam here and not just on Fridays because it’s just on weekdays as well.
There are long queues, sometimes quite up on Hellisheiði for those who want to get here on their way east and those who are coming west, so it gives an eye that we need to get a new bridge and no later than yesterday," says Helgi S. Haraldsson, President of the local government in Årborg.
Helgi says that the local authorities in Årborg recently had a meeting with the CEO of Vegagerðin and the designer of Vegagerðin, and that meeting was very positive.
“If you’ve ever been optimistic that you’re working on these issues, I think I can say that now because you’re really working on this and we should be able to see a new bridge being offered this fall.”
But does Helgi have any advice for those drivers who are waiting at Ölfusárbrú every day during the summer?
"Yes, you can go through the narrowness and through the Eyrarbakki, it speeds up but those who are going eastwards, it is not possible to point them to go the Lyngdalsheiði but those who are going to the uphills should use Mosfellsheiði, Þingvellir and Lyngdalsheiði".
Helgi S. Haraldsson, President of the Municipal Council of Årborg, who says the traffic jam, which is formed at Ölfusárbrú at Selfoss is intolerable.
Long queues are formed every day at Ölfusárbrú and drivers often have to wait a considerable amount of time to cross the bridge.
Then the only advice is to take a deep breath and think something positive.
The future of koala bears in northern Brisbane goes to planning court
The city government said that in addition to the area being a vital home for koala bears, flounders, and the grey geese, it was an important link between the natural areas of Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek.
Commissioners have appealed the rejection of the municipality to the Court of Planning and Environment on the grounds that the structure is in line with the City Planning Act of 2014, would meet planning and community needs that have not been met to date and "could be carried out without unacceptable effects".
There is a great deal of opposition to these planned projects in the immediate environment.
The Commissioners argue that although the proposal is fully in line with the scheme, it could be amended if it does not meet requirements, rather than rejected.
Currently, the project includes many stages, including a service center, child care, and 39 residences.
Public submissions were more than 120 at the time of consultation, and most objected to the proposal as it was too large and inappropriate for the area.
The minority leader of the Brisbane City Council said the city would need to buy the land to protect the koala bear.
"[The mayor] Adrian Schrinner needs to stop wasting taxpayer funds in a fight with developers in court and buy this land to protect Brisbane's natural and wildlife," said City Commissioner Cassidy.
“This is one of the most important homes for koala bears in the Mountain to Mangroves natural area, and there are a lot of koala bears there.”
Schrinner said this week that the municipality wanted the home of koala bears in the area to be protected.
"We didn't think the proposal was suitable for the area," Schrinner said.
“I understand that this is now going through the court system and obviously we hope that it will result in a good and positive outcome that will ensure that the home is preserved.”
Schrinner said that mapping the homes of koala bears is the joint responsibility of the municipality and government, but that the government is responsible for accurate maps of the homes of koala bears supported by local authorities when they take applications for implementation for treatment.
The next step is to win something.
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, coach of Man Utd, was hoping a matchup with the team securing third place in the English Premier League today.
The team will play in the European Championship next season.
United needed a draw or a win against Leicester today and was the result of the Red Devils' 2-0 victory.
“It’s a great achievement for the players to be in third place, given the way things have been during the season.
I think we guys may have gotten over a mental hurdle by winning such a big game, as we have lost twice in the playoffs this season.
We knew we needed a final today, now we can start the next chapter that is with these boys winning titles," said Solskjaer winner.
Manchester United still have a chance to win a title this season, but the team will play in the European League in August and are as good as 8th place there.
Armistice begins at midnight in war-torn eastern Ukraine
Kiev, Ukraine – The Ukrainian army and forces of resistance in eastern Ukraine are now preparing a "complete" ceasefire to begin at midnight and as representatives hope to be the first step towards peace after a conflict for 6 years.
Representatives of opposition forces said on Sunday that they had given orders to their soldiers to cease-fire and issued a decree banning the use of weapons.
Ukrainian forces said their forces had "sea preparations" for the ceasefire.
If successful, it would "facilitate the way for the implementation of other provisions" of the Minsk Peace Accords, according to a statement by the office of the President of Ukraine earlier this week calling the ceasefire a milestone.
The goal of the Minsk Peace Accords, made in 2015 by France and Germany, was to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and the separatists who are enjoying Russia's presence, but that conflict began in 2014 after Russia's annexation of the Crimea and its support for the separatists.
More than 14,000 people have died in the conflict.
The presidents of Russia and Ukraine both welcomed the ceasefire in a call on Sunday, stressing the importance of implementing the agreement reached at the Paris meeting in December.
Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, expressed concern about Kiev's call for the Minks agreement to be revised, saying that Volodimir Selensky's position, the President of Ukraine, on the "transparency of the Minsk agreement, which he once again expressed in this call".
Selensky, however, stressed the need to take "further action" to free the Ukrainians who are prisoners of insurgents in Eastern Ukraine, on the annexed Crimea and in Russia, according to a statement from the President's office.
According to the 2015 agreement, Ukraine can only gain control of borders with Russia in the areas under the control of the separatists once they have gained wide autonomy and once elections have been held in the areas.
The agreement eased conflict, but Ukraine's army and rebels have continued to exchange shots.
When the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris in December to have other talks, support for the Minsk Accords was expressed and agreed to restart the peace process.
Selensky, who won the 2019 election with promises to end the conflict, wanted Ukraine to gain control of the border for the first regional elections, but the Kremlin government demands that the agreement be implemented without change.
The new ceasefire agreement was reached on Wednesday for the endorsement of a three-way cooperation group, appointed by representatives of Russia and Ukraine as well as the European Security and Cooperation Agency, and was therefore welcomed by EU officials.
At the traditional Sunday Blessing on St. Peter's Square, Pope Francis also mentioned the truce, saying that it would be necessary to "rebuild trust and lay the foundation for a very necessary and long-awaited reconciliation with the people".
Police: Man shot dead in Texas protest
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) – A man was shot dead in a protest in Texas when he approached a car and the driver of the car fired his weapon, according to police.
Police spokeswoman Katrina Ratliff told reporters early Sunday that the shooting occurred just before 10 p.m. at a protest in Austin.
The man was taken to hospital where he was later pronounced dead.
The car had whistled, turned down a road, and then speeded the trip towards protesters, said witness Michael Capochiano to the Austin American-Statesman newspaper.
The man, who had a rifle on him, according to Capochiano, approached the vehicle and was shot by the driver.
The driver then drove away, Capochiano said.
Ratliff told reporters that early reports indicated that "the victim may have had a rifle" and added that the suspect was in custody and was willing to cooperate with police.
According to news agencies, the group had gathered because of the Black Lives Matter protests on Saturday.
The protestors were streamed live on Facebook and there could be heard in the whistle of the car and several shots fired.
The first win in July
Breiðablik won their first league win from 29 June when the team fielded IA, 5x3, in the men's Pepsi Max division at Kopavogur tonight.
The Tigers lost their third game in a row.
After winning their first three games in the league, Breiðablik played five games without a win and had lost three in a row for the game to IA tonight.
It was, therefore, enough or kill for Blika to come into the game with great force.
Alexander Helgi Sigurðarson put the team in the lead with a nice turnout in the 11th minute after Kristinn Steindórsson had sent him through IA's defence.
Six minutes later, Kristinn then doubled the lead after a very beautiful preparation by Gísli Eyjólfsson from the left edge.
The Skagamans did not make it to land or beach in the first half, as high-pressure locals made it extremely difficult for them to link transmissions together.
Blikir had all the power on the field and scored the third goal in the 36th minute when Daninn Thomas Mikkelsen rattled in Höskuldur Gunnlaugsson's corner kick.
Then Kristinn Steindórsson scored his second goal and fourth goal Blika just three minutes later.
But the first half didn’t end there.
The Skagamen were hopeful for the latter when Tryggvi Hrafn Haraldsson scored from a penalty kick shortly before a game break, but Kwame Quee had then clumsily broken Viktori Jónsson within Blika's teig.
4-1 was therefore the score for Breiðablik when the half-time batting bludgeoned.
Only three minutes had passed of the second half when the Skagamen scored again.
Hlynur Sævar Jónsson was then alone and unbeaten on Blika's mark and easily steered the ball into the net after the corner kick of Tryggvi Hrafn Haraldsson.
However, Hlynn became a criminal within a teigs IA just three minutes later when he broke on Alexander Helga.
A penalty shootout was judged, and Thomas Mikkelsen scored from safety to come over the widening 5x2 when only seven minutes had passed of the second half.
Five minutes after Mikkelsen's goal, the Skagamen scored again.
Anton Ari Einarsson, goalkeeper of Blika, then came under pressure from Viktori Jónsson, gave the ball to Viktor's foot from which the ball turned down in the net.
Unbelievably a 5x3 score hit when less than ten minutes had passed of the second half, but it slowed down the subsequent goal scoring.
Despite the fine chances for both teams to add a margin, including two death-rows of Kwame Quee from the Bredabliki, they made no more and a 5-4 victory of the Bredablik final.
Breiðablik thus won his first win in less than a month, from 29 June, and is the team after the win with 14 points in third place, two points from Val which is a place above and three from KR's top team.
Both sides have a game inside of them.
The IA has to accept the third consecutive loss in the league, but the team has ten points in eighth place, five points from a drop seat.
The dog is not in danger despite the White House's comments
The producers of the Puppy Squad commented yesterday that they should not stop showing the children's material in the near future.
The statement follows remarks by Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, that the factors that include law enforcement dogs were victims of "cancel culture".
Canadian producers of the show were quick to respond to McEnany's words, publishing that their fans would not have to worry about the future of the Puppy Squad.
A number of television series dealing with police work have been taken out of show in the United States recently following a protest against police violence.
However, the Puppy Squad is not included, despite the fact that it carried the reputation of that content on social media.
In a press conference at the White House on Friday, McEnany said that US President Trump was opposed to "a culture of exclusion" and especially when it came to the police.
The term refers to when comments or actions by individuals or businesses evoke a harsh response on social media, calling for the party to be boycotted in protest.
“We saw it a few weeks ago that shows on the Puppy Squad, a children’s issue about cops, were stopped.
Likewise with Cops and Live PD," McEnany said on Friday.
She then added that the Danish toy manufacturer Lego has taken a law enforcement kit out of sale, but there is no leg for that claim, according to Lego's defenders.
However, it is true that the reality shows Cops and Live PD were recently taken from a show there on the west coast.
Both episodes include controversy for showing footage of actual police work without obtaining permission from individuals appearing there.
Together for 29 Years - Sometimes Jealousy and Suspicion
Kristín Tómasdóttir, a family therapist, answers questions from readers about issues related to the family, children and love in Family Corner DV.
This time, she responds to readers who have never been single.
We have been together since we were 15 years old, have been together for 29 years and have two children.
We know nothing but being together and feeling good, but we have both felt like we are losing something.
We have never been with other people and have no comparison as to how this could be different.
This has sometimes caused jealousy and distrust in relation to whether the other party is looking around, is thinking about adultery or even divorce, and is changing.
When we talk about this, we agree to cultivate our relationship, but this is the kind of nightmare that always hangs over us.
Do you have any advice?
Thank you for the wonderful question and I am glad that you are able to communicate so openly that you can discuss your complex feelings in relation to the relationship.
What would frighten me would be if you were thinking this separately in each corner, could not discuss this and even take some steps that you could then later regret.
It’s all on the table, isn’t it?
Strong self-esteem has the most predictive of happiness in the future and the stronger your self-esteem, the more likely you are to acquire a spouse with a strong self-esteem.
The reasons why relationships that begin in adolescence do not always last a lifetime, is often that people grow up in each direction, but in cases where there is a complementary effect, the individuals can become stronger as a whole than many others.
As your connection begins to form during your greatest formative years, you may conclude that you have matured together and had a positive impact on each other's self-image.
We are connected by the relationships we are in.
The way I talk is shaped by the way you listen.
The way I look at myself depends on how you look at me.
Relationships define who we are.
Could you reverse the example and think: What do we have that others don’t?
What do these years give us?
I can assure you that the benefits can be much greater than the drawbacks.
You’ve been shaping each other for years, and as a result, you can say that you’re tailored to each other.
That’s more than many people can say.
It's worth it?
You’re talking about experiencing that you’ve missed something, but it’s important to remember that big changes like divorce and a new relationship also come with companion fish that you’re not necessarily excited about.
You may be missing out on a fresh start, learning to be alone again, getting to know a new person, and putting families together.
This brings with it new challenges, different problems, and possibly something new and exciting.
But this doesn’t just come with a pink cloud and happiness, oh no, at your age, this can become a darn complex project, which can possibly never crumble as well as you’ve already done to each other.
Is it worth it?
Would it not also be wise to focus on what you can do to increase excitement, unpredictability and innovation in your relationship?
You haven’t put your shoes on the shelf.
There are so many things you can do to make this long-term relationship even deeper.
What kind of experiments can you make in this regard?
What do you need from your spouse that you are not getting?
What can you give your partner that you have never done before?
You may need to sit down and re-establish your relationship.
Do you want to spend more time alone or together?
Do you want to try something new?
Today, there is considerably more tolerance towards various forms of relationship, and couples are beginning to define their relationships in a number of ways, such as open relationship, multiple love, or deciding to temporarily break up.
I am not at all telling you what to do, not even an expert in your solutions, but it would possibly ease this heavy weight that looms over you, if you look into this and think in solutions.
What do you need to lose faith and fear?
You've been together for 29 years, which means you're capable of a lot of things together.
Use it as a strength and stay in your hands towards your solution.
We encourage readers to send their questions and concerns to Kristín at: hjonabandssaela@gmail.com.
The questions will be answered here in the Family Corner, of course anonymously and in complete confidence.
Lost the cup and smashed it
Despite the vast experience Branislav Ivanovic has of lifting cups and celebrating titles, he lost and broke an impressive medal in cheers after becoming a Russian Cup champion yesterday.
Ivanovic won a number of titles as a Chelsea player between 2008 and 2017 but then went home to Russia and joined Zenit's ranks.
There, he has now become Russia's champion two years in a row, and yesterday the team secured the cup championship with a 1–0 win over Khimki, with the winning goal coming from Artem Dzyuba's penalty shootout in the 84th minute.
The medal in the Russian Cup is made of glass and when Ivanovic, who is captain of Zenit, dropped the cup into the ground so it broke, as can be seen.
Ivanovic and his partners did not let it go and continued the celebration until the night.
This is war!
Coleen Rooney hires lawyer Johnny Depp in the "Wagatha Christie" rhyme with Rebekah Vardy
Coleen Rooney has asked David Sherborne to defend himself against allegations of injury against Rebekah Vardy
After discussions between the footballers' spouses went out of business, their acquaintances expect a dramatic showdown
Coleen Rooney has hired the star lawyer in Johnny Depp's controversial injury case to defend himself in his so-called "Wagatha Christie" legal dispute with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday mimics that Rooney commissioned David Sherborne to defend herself against allegations that she had an injury to Vardy, with claims that personal information was leaked to the media by her closed Instagram account.
The news comes a few days after evidence was submitted to the Supreme Court, stating that Rebekah Vardy, who is married to parishioner Jamie Vardy of the Leicester City football team, suffered physically and mentally after the claims of Coleen Rooney.
The paper states that the mother's five children, aged 38, "had severe panic attacks and anxiety attacks so she was afraid to go out of the house" and that Vardy, who was then seven months pregnant, "had been hospitalized three times ... because of a panic attack attributed to the post and its consequences".
In addition to being Depp's lawyer in his injury case against The Sun, due to allegations that the actor beat his wife, Sherborne, aged 50, goes with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's case in their private case against Associated Newspapers, the publishers of The Mail on Sunday.
After reconciliation talks between the two football owners failed, those familiar with the dramatic outcome in the courtroom are expected.
"If you thought the Depp trial was a spectacle, don't underestimate the upcoming war of the football owners," said a source.
“Now it’s a real war. Coleen doesn’t give up, and neither does Becky. It’s going to be emotional.”
Coleen Rooney claimed that someone who used Rebekah Vardy's Instagram account leaked fabricated stories about her to a newspaper.
She was named "Wagatha Christie" after revealing how she spent five months gradually limiting the number of friends who could see updates to her Instagram stories, until only Vardy's account was left.
Coleen then claims to have posted an uproarious story on Instagram, which would then have appeared in a gossip magazine.
In Vardy's case, which denies membership in the case, she claims that she was made a scapegoat after Rooney published the allegations "overtly, with the aim of causing much harm and immense suffering".
Coleen's lawyers have questioned these words, saying that statements about her suffering are only made to the media, drawing attention to the facts of the case.
A source said: "The documents from Becky are misleading, it's all fabrication."
It is Paul Lunt, a lawyer at Brabner's law firm in Liverpool, who is handling Coleen Rooney's case, who has four sons with former England champion Wayne Rooney.
Vardy is at the Kingsley Napley law firm in London, it is uncertain if she has hired a lawyer yet.
Coleen Rooney's spokesman refused to give an interview.
Biden's election team denies "Fox News Sunday" interview one week after Chris Wallace's interview with Trump
In Trump's interview with Chris Wallace last week, President Trump doubted that the future Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, would handle the flood of questions that Wallace had dropped on Trump.
We may never get an answer to that question – at least not for now.
On Sunday, Wallace informed viewers that Biden's campaign team had told Fox News that he was "not available" in an interview.
"In our interview with President Trump last week, he doubted that his opponent in the Democratic Party, Joe Biden, would plummet in a similar situation," Wallace said.
"This week we both asked Biden's campaign team for an interview and they said the former vice president was not available."
"We keep asking every week," he added.
Trump's campaign team has for months criticized Biden for avoiding election meetings and press conferences while he attends interviews during the coronavirus epidemic.
Although Biden has recently restarted his campaign, Trump and his associates have continued to mock the former vice president for "hiding" at his home in Delaware.
However, Biden's reluctance to attend public events has not been marred by his availability, as recent polls show that Biden has a good advantage over Trump both nationally and in major fighting states.
Real Clear Politics averages indicate that the president was 7 percent under in Florida, 6.7 percent in Pennsylvania, 8.2 in Michigan, and 6.4 in Wisconsin.
Trump won in all four states in 2016 when he turned them over to the Republican Party when he won the fight for the White House.
In the latest Fox News Poll, Biden has an advantage in Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, outside of the margin of error in all cases.
Surveys also indicate that Biden has a slight advantage in Ohio, North Carolina, and Arizona, three other important fighting states in this election.
And polls suggest that states that used to be trusted strongholds of Republicans, such as Texas and Georgia, are now divided between Trump and the former vice president.
Presidential elections in which the incumbent president bids for a second term in the White House are often a vote for that president – and that seems to be the case now in 2020 in the fight between Trump and Biden.
The most pressing issues have been the coronavirus and the economy that is in decline due to the epidemic – and the performance and history of the president in both case categories.
Kanye West and his mental health problems
Kanye West apologized to his wife, Kim Kardashian, for his remarks.
The head of Mental Health believes he is drawing on his creativity in mental health, but a psychiatrist says it is important that people take medication to keep the disease at bay.
The rapper Kanye West is not only one of the most original and influential musicians of the time, but he is no less famous as the husband of reality show star Kim Kardashian.
His private life has largely been conducted in open-air settings.
It drew a lot of attention when he announced earlier this month that he was running for president of the United States, and gave an emotional and dispassionate speech.
Later, a strange tweet appeared from him on Twitter, claiming, among other things, that his wife was trying to have him hospitalized.
Kim Kardashian later posted a statement on Instagram asking people to show understanding to her husband and family; he had bipolar disorder, and it would be difficult for his loved ones to help him if he did not want to seek help himself.
He has since publicly apologized to her.
This famous family is not alone in facing this problem.
It is estimated that about one percent of people have a mental illness.
Ferdinand Jónsson is a mental health specialist at a hospital in London, and knows the disease well.
“This disease can cause such unbearable distress for individuals and especially for their families and loved ones.
This mania or mania can ruin relationships and work and cause unbearable grief.
And then the other side, the depression, it's often very dangerous, because there's a high rate of suicides in that group.
I thought it was great that she said that.
And it's just human and human," says Ferdinand.
Héðinn Unnsteinsson, chairman of Psychiatry, has himself struggled with mental illness – and is a fan of Kanye West: “He seems to have a very vivid imagination.
If we are four strings of earthly double bass, then he is a hundred strings of heavenly harp.
And he is so overly creative, overpoweringly powerful and smart in his powerful connection thinking, because one becomes aware of this connection thinking that we who have had to try it to go into a maniacal state know so well."
Kanye West does not want to take psychotropic drugs, because he believes they reduce his creativity.
He has covered the psychedelics, including on the album Ye.
He said it was his choice not to take any medication.
“Many people feel that this creative element is constrained by this unbridled connection between thought and the unmitigated creative power of fire that he has, but then there are the natural flaws of it, often great suffering, and wave-numbered and dark cellars and darkness.”
However, Ferdinand says it is important that people with bipolar disorder receive treatment.
“If you have a lot of mania, you’re not making great things, you’re just on the side.
And just like when people go into severe depression, people are completely paralyzed by that condition," he says.
So you would advise Kanye West to take medication?
"Finally," says Ferdinand.
“And especially working with someone to find the right dosages and this way to balance the best of medicine with the best of his ability and creativity.”

Delhi Metro casts first pillar on fourth stage of construction
Delhi Metro reached an important stage in the fourth phase of construction when the first pillar was cast for the route between Janakpuri West and R K Ashram Marg, which is being laid, according to employees on Sunday.
The pillar was cast in Keshopur and on a raised section between Keshopur and Mukarba Chowk on Saturday night.
"Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) stepped another important step in the fourth stage of construction as the first pillar at this stage of the train system's expansion was cast for the route between Janakpuri West and R K Ashram Marg," said in a statement by DMRC.
This "important implementation phase" was achieved despite a high labour shortage and other organizational challenges caused by the pandemic, according to employees.
The average height of the pillars on this route is 10 metres.
However, the pillars will be at a height of 20 metres at Madhuban Chowk, where the route overlaps with Route 1, and 25 metres at Haiderpur Badli Mor, where the route meets Route 2.
At Haiderpur Badli Mor will be the bridge road at 28 metres, which is the largest floor in the history of the Dehli Metro as stated in the statement.
The highest point of the train system is currently located at Dhaula Kuan, where a bridge road leads 7 reaches a height of 23.6 metres.
In the context of structural engineering, pillars are vertically load-bearing structures that support the adjacent ends of two tracks.
They form a vertical structure that carries the elevated bridgeway of the train system.
This train system pillar can be seen on the countless major railways that underlie the Delí train system tracks.
The number of pillars now plays an important role as a landmark for addresses in the Delí metropolitan area.
The 28.92 km long route from Janakpuri West to R K Ahsram Marg is an extension of the Magenta route, and it will have 22 stations.
21.18 km of the route will be elevated and 7.74 km will be underground.
Construction of this section began in December last year.
On 17 July, work began in the underground section of the route when construction of a curtain wall at Krishna Park Extension railway station was started.
On 24 June, the DMRC began to ply a U-carpet piece that would later be placed in the elevated part of the route.
In the fourth stage of construction, 61,679 km of new train tracks will be laid out for three different routes with 45 train stations.
These new parts will offer connections between the parts of the train system already operated by Delhi Metro.
Of these, 22.35 km will be underground, while other parts will be elevated.

India, which is in third place across the countries worst affected by the coronavirus pandemic after the United States and Brazil, has gradually increased its screening capacity for COVID-19 and has conducted more than 420,000 tests in one day, the health ministry said on Saturday, saying this achievement is explained by the proliferation of laboratories.
The pandemic has killed more than 633,000 people worldwide since its outbreak in China late last year, and more than 15.5 million people have been infected, according to the AFP news agency.
"A vexed" ambassador wants a gun, armored car and an injection vest - Said subordinates to be ambassadors of the "deep state"
U.S. Ambassador Jeffrey Ross Gunter has said he wants to carry a gun in CBS News.
As CBS reported, “Despite being located in one of the safest states in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter is ‘sick’ about his safety since arriving in Reykjavík last year.”
Refers to CBS in 12 diplomats, government officials, and former representatives as well as individuals familiar with the case.
Gunter's conclusion was to demand from the U.S. Department of State that they request permission for the ambassador to walk around armed in this country.
He is also said to have requested an armored car that traveled with him between locations in Iceland and an injection vest.
The U.S. State Department refused to comment on whether any threat was posed to the ambassador's security, however U.S. government officials said that the ambassador was expressed that Iceland was a safe country and that he was safe here.
However, it would have been advertised for bodyguards in Icelandic newspapers, says CBS, and is part of becoming a part of the ambassador's demands.
CBS reported that the Icelandic Foreign Ministry did not wish to comment on the matter with CBS.
However, the U.S. news agency for its sources in this country has stated that no request has been received by the local government of that substance.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter was spoken of walking around armed as it would offend the host state, Iceland.
The ambassador was rewarded for generously supporting Donald Trump's campaign in the 2016 presidential election.
Previously, he was a dermatologist in California.
Since taking office in May, Gunter has said he has created an "impossible" working environment in the embassy and has already had seven subordinates, the so-called Deputy Chief of Mission, subordinates of the ambassador who are at the same time diplomats.
They were all diplomats from the U.S. State Department.
The first was sent away by the ambassador "because he did not like his appearance."
I’ve been preparing for a year and learning Spanish.
The next one lasted only six months.
As a result, staff rotation was created and the idea was to let Gunter match as many people until he looked at one of them.
Furthermore, CBS reports that Gunter loved the embassy's staff to go on the errand of the "deep state" and to have undermined him with the State Department in Washington, D.C.
The heads of the D.C. Ministry of Foreign Affairs are well aware of the situation at their embassy in Reykjavík, but have been hesitant to intervene in the embassy's anarchy in light of Gunter's connection to the White House.
Gunter is also said to have had difficulty following the orders of the Washington State Department, and is said to have refused to return to D.C. during the Covid-19 outbreak.
He left the embassy in the hands of his employees for several months.
He is said to have intended to work from his home in California unless ordered by the Secretary of State himself, Mike Pompeo, to return.
Finally turning back
Having finally received the order, Gunter returned to Iceland in May.
His new subordinate, Michelle Yerkin, then came to the country this month.
CBS has not received any answers to their inquiries to the U.S. State Department.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not wish to comment on CBS, nor on DV's inquiry.
Gunter is one of the many politically appointed ambassadors of the Trump administration who has attracted attention for unusual behavior over the past month.
Woody Johnson, for example, had a strong reaction when it came to the day that he was trying to have the British Open championship in golf transferred to a golf course owned by Trump.
The ambassador to South Africa has also been accused of firing her number two man and then attempting to appoint her son to the job.
42% of U.S. ambassadors are politically appointed.
30% were politically appointed to the Obama administration, and 32% to the George W. Bush administration.
Protestors and police in high regard in Seattle over Trump's plans to send FBI forces there
Seattle police used flare bombs and pepper spray on protesters who set fire to work trailers at juvenile detention centers on Saturday, following outrage among the public over President Donald Trump's plans to send federal police forces into major cities.
Repeated bomb blasts raged through the streets of Seattle City, Washington, and smoke came from the site where protesters had carried fire to trailers in a construction area at the juvenile detention center.
Opponents slashed car tires and broke windows in caravans.
A riot police campaigned against protesters, some of whom were holding umbrellas to defend against the pepper spray caps raining over them.
The Seattle Times has reported that 16 people were arrested on suspicion of assaulting police officers, for obstructing police work, or for refusing to leave the area.
Poland to withdraw from European Convention on the Prevention of Violence against Women
Poland's right-wing government says it will withdraw from the European Convention on the Prevention of Violence against Women.
The Istanbul Agreement is the world's first binding law that aims to prevent violence against women, while Poland's Minister of Justice, Zbigniew Ziobro, describes the text as "harmful" in that he demands that schools teach children about gender from a sociological perspective.
Ziobro said over the weekend that on Monday he would begin to prepare the formal process for the country to withdraw from the deal.
“This ideological factor relates to attempts to change education in schools and leisure activities, in terms of the study, attitude and conviction of a young generation of Poles, based on the conclusion, which in our opinion is wrong, that biological sex is old-fashioned and that everything is really about socio-cultural sex.”
Ziobro believes that the provisions of the Convention on the Education of Children and Young People as well as family ties in the context of LGBT people are unacceptable.
"We also reject the LGBT program in the debate over family ties, because this is an opinion held up by left-wing activists or groups of gay people who want their views to become binding laws," he said.
The Council of Europe said on Sunday that it was "disgusting" that Poland was considering withdrawing from the agreement.
In Warsaw on Friday, around 2,000 people, including groups of women and other groups of rights fighters, protested outside the offices of the right-wing organization Ordo Luris, which supports the country's withdrawal from the agreement.
"We will not be victims," they called.
Protests also took place in other cities in Poland.
Poland signed the Istanbul Agreement to prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence in December 2012 and ratified it in 2015.
Maurice Petty, mechanic at the Hall of Honor, dead at 81
KANSAS CITY, Kansas (AP) - Maurice Petty, who was part of a quarter mile driving empire that includes his father Lee and his brother Richard, and who was the first mechanic admitted to the NASCAR Hall of Honor, died on Saturday.
He was 81 years old.
Petty's family did not give up his cause of death.
His funeral has not been reported.
While his other family members were praised for their skills behind the wheel, Maurice Petty earned the nickname "The Boss" for his skills with the screw wrench.
He helped his family win 198 races and seven titles in the NASCAR Grand Prix, and also built engines that guaranteed the Honor Hall partner Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal and Pete Hamilton victory.
"The manager was one of the most agile mechanics in NASCAR history," said Chairman and CEO Jim France.
“He brought the power that helped Petty Enterprises achieve its sporting excellence.
Although Maurice was known for his work under the hood, he also performed various roles behind the scenes and did what it took to get his cars on the winning track."
Maurice Petty was born on March 27, 1939, in Level Cross, North Carolina.
He followed his father to the race track when he was little, and his knowledge of mechanical engineering soon became a crucial factor in landing Lee Petty's win in 54 races and three championships.
He competed 26 times in the NASCAR Cup between 1960 and 1964, being seven times in the top five and 16 times in the top 10.
However, he soon decided to focus on what happens under the engine cover rather than behind the steering wheel, which turned out to be a charm for his older brother, who relied on his engines during his triumphal march.
Richard, then known as the "King", won the first championship along with the Governor in 1964 with a Plymouth car.
They won again in 1967, then two consecutive years in 1970 and 1971, and achieved three more titles before the 1980s were over.
With these seven titles on their backs, they share the record in the greatest number of titles with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson.
"Maurice Petty was one of the true pioneers of NASCAR and during her career at Petty Enterprises was instrumental in building one of the top teams in NASCAR," said Winston Kelley in a statement.
“Although Petty’s wins are listed as 212, he claims well over 250 wins if all the machines he built for his rivals are taken.
The board will forever be remembered as one of the best engine makers in NASCAR history."
Lee Petty died in 2000 and Patricia, Maurice Petty's wife of 52 years, died in 2014.
He was also an uncle of the former driver and pressman Kyle Petty and Trent Owens, a team captain in the pickup race.
"While we now bid farewell to Maurice Petty, one of the true and energetic pioneers and heroes of NASCAR, his legacy and name will be kept in our memory, kept aloft and preserved throughout the future," Kelley said.
"We send our deepest condolences to the Petty family."
"Want to see" continued stay in prison
The police in the capital area had in various ways turned today.
Among the tasks that the police received was to arrest a man at the police station on Hverfisgata this morning.
He had been released from a prison cell shortly before, but refused to leave, repeatedly came back and did not obey police instructions to leave.
"He earned a continued stay with the police," says a police diary.
Other police tasks included reporting a physical attack in Breiðholt at 11 a.m. this morning and having police involvement with two men because of it.
At that time, the police had involved a woman in a shopping center in Kópavogur, she had been sitting there eating but did not have the funds to pay the bill.

Pedro's Chelsea sales confirmed and teammates say goodbye to him with a song in the dressing room
Frank Lampard, manager of Chelsea, honored winger Pedro Rodriguez after he played his last league game for the club on Sunday.
The 32-year-old player agreed to extend his contract temporarily to finish the season at the club, but will go on free sales to AS Roma at the end of the season.
The Spanish national team, who came from Barcelona in 2015, has been in a secondary role at Lampard during this season, as he has only been in the starting line-up eight times in the Premier League and played a total of 21 games in all competitions.
The manager of the Western Lundin team blue-clad confirmed Pedro's departure after the club secured a spot in the top four with a 2-0 win against Wolves, with the racer coming in off the bench to play his last game.
"Pedro has played his last game with the club," Lampard told Sky Sports.
“The boys adored him in the dressing room, and it’s deserved when you look at his career as a whole and with the club.
This was his last major league game, but he has put his mark firmly on the team.
I would like to thank Pedro very much and wish him success in the future.
He will stay here for the remaining games but with him goes away a great player, and the socialite I witnessed after the game was quite special.
Pedro posted a farewell message after the game on his Twitter account, writing: “My last game at Stamford Bridge.
I want to thank every fan for their support over the years, the club for giving me the opportunity to be blue-skinned, and my teammates.
You will always have a place in my heart.
Let's go get the FA Cup!!!
THE BIG BLUE MOUNTAIN COLD."
Pedro, who previously played as a forward at Barcelona, now leaves Chelsea after being with the team since it won the title in 2017 under Antonio Conte, the FA Cup in 2018, as well as the European League a year later under Maurizio Sarri.
He received another arrest.
A man was arrested for the second time in a short time this morning after refusing to leave the police station when he had been released.
The man was arrested last night due to drunk driving and he was saved in a detention facility overnight.
When he was released this morning, he refused to go away and reportedly came back to police several times.
He did not repeatedly obey police orders to leave and "earned" a continued stay with the police, according to a police diary in the capital area.
A restaurant that keeps the two-meter rule
It is wonderful to see how restaurants maintain the two-meter rule to keep their restaurants open and respect all the rules that have been set.
Here are some pictures from around the world, where the atmosphere is a little different than in this country.
Troops destroy camps and bring down fighters in Zamfara State
Air strikes carried out by the aviation division of Operation HADARIN DAJI have destroyed a new military camp of a fighting group under the so-called "Dangote" in the Doumborou Forest in Zamfara State.
Lieutenant-Colonel John Enenche and a defense representative said that the air raid, in which a number of fighters also fell, had been carried out as a result of HUMINT data acquisition and a number of air patrol missions for confirmation.
Lieutenant Enenche said that the intelligence data revealed that members of the force had moved with supplies, motorcycles, and hundreds of stolen livestock from their former residence to a new location through a rocky mountainous terrain inside the forest.
Enenche said that as a result, the air force had sent a special-strength squadron of fighter planes and armed helicopters from the Nigerian Army to attack the area.
He is quoted as saying: "The attack plane fired accurate shots at the area and killed some of the fighters.
Many others, seen trying to escape the area in the confusion, were dropped in further attacks."
Along with commending the operation's air force HADARIN DAJI for its professionalism, Air Force Chief of Staff Sadique Abubakar urged the air force to give in to air strikes on fighters.
The military council commander assigned them to continue their air operations in support of land operations, in order to eradicate all fighters and restore calm to the north-west and central areas of the north of the country.
Suspected of First Coronavirus Infection in North Korea
North Korea’s state news agency reported last night that the first COVID-19 case was most likely detected in that country.
According to the report, the infected man who fled the country three years ago returned to North Korea last week.
The man was in the border city of Kaesong when he was diagnosed with the coronavirus and the city has been isolated and a curfew has been placed on the residents.
Kim Jong-un, the dictator of North Korea, was invited to an emergency meeting with senior officials, where a response to this tumultuous news was planned.
The state television report states that Kim ordered that "maximum security measures be taken" to curb the spread of the virus.
He also ordered an investigation into how the man came undetected across the well-guarded border of the two Koreas, warning that those responsible for it should "harden punishment" over their heads.

Serbia wants to increase military aircraft in growing tensions in the Balkans
BELGRAD, Serbia (AP) - Serbia will strengthen its military and seek to buy more military aircraft as tensions mount in the Balkans, the president of Serbia said on Sunday.
President Aleksandar Vucic said that "certain efforts" were underway to buy a fleet of fighters, and accused the United States and other Western states of having armed the neighboring states of Serbia that are in NATO, as well as Kosovo, a former province of Serbia.
"The Americans, the Turks and the Germans think well of their beloved offspring," Vucic said, referring to Kosovo.
He said that the United States had recently handed over to Kosovo security forces a number of armored cars.
During a tour of the Serbian Army's tank squadron, Vucic said his people cannot compete with NATO's "contributions" to the armaments of their neighbors and that "that's why we're up on ourselves".
Vucic did not specify what type of military aircraft Serbia was planning to purchase, but the media loyal to the government say his government has publicly requested the delivery of 20 attack aircraft from the United States.
Washington has not responded to the request from Belgrade, and if it is rejected, it is likely that an attack aircraft of the Sukhoi-25 type will be purchased from Russia.
Serbia, which maintains a policy of neutrality in military affairs, has recently been supplied with an advanced anti-aircraft system from Russia, which has also provided fighters, assault helicopters and armored vehicles.
China, which is also Serbia's coalition nation, has handed over drones to the state for use in warfare.
U.S. officials have openly discussed bringing sanctions against Serbia if more weapons are brought to the country from Moscow, especially weapons that could jeopardize the security of nearby NATO member states.
In the West and in neighbouring Serbia, people are concerned about the armaments of Russia and China in Serbia.
Tensions are now increasing in the Balkans, where there was a civil war in the 1990s.
The Atlantic Alliance intervened with Serbia to stop Serb bloody actions against separatist Kosovo Albanians in 1999.
Despite formally seeking to join the European Union, Serbia's populist leadership has further strengthened its political and military ties with the Kremlin and Beijing.
Serbia, as well as Russia and China, do not recognize the independence of Kosovo, which the United States and most Western countries have recognized.
Heart attack: Probability of this deadly disease can be reduced by eating chocolate once a week
A new study suggests that certain goodies may be good for the heart muscle.
What is it? And how could it reduce the chances of a heart attack?
Scientists have made a meta-analysis of coronary heart disease covering more than five decades.
The main symptoms of coronary heart disease (also referred to as coronary heart disease) are three: chest pain (angina), heart attack, and heart failure.
Other symptoms of the disease may include palpitations and severe shortness of breath.
“Chocolate contains nutrients that are good for the heart, such as flavonoids, methylxanthine, polyphenol and steric acid, which can reduce inflammation and raise good cholesterol.”
Good cholesterol, also referred to as high-density fat protein, collects "bad" cholesterol – a type of cholesterol that narrows the arteries of the heart – and transports it to the liver.
The ‘bad' cholesterol (low-density fat protein) is broken down in the liver, and is then excreted from the body.
However, the new study does not examine the dosage or type of chocolate consumed.
It is not clear if participants ate dark chocolate, milk chocolate, or other cocoa candy.
The results were based on an earlier study that concluded that the consumption of cocoa (found in chocolate) reduced the likelihood of a heart attack.
Scientists believe that flavonoids found in chocolate lower blood pressure and improve vascular function.
Vascular function refers to how well the blood distributes oxygen and nutrients throughout the body and carries waste away.
There was no mention of lifestyle factors in the results of the new study.
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein said of the data that those who had admitted to eating chocolate were more likely to have a healthy body weight.
She added that they could exercise regularly and feel less stress.
“Each of these factors could have an independent impact on cardiovascular health,” she added.
Coles Trades Plastic Toys for Books in New Collections Promotional Campaign
“We’ve really listened and that was a key element in the preparation of the project,” Ronson said.
“We don’t believe that people want to recycle books – we think they’ll want to have them, but they can recycle them at home if they want to.”
Ronson said the new promotional campaign had been in progress long before COVID-19 came along, and despite the epidemic, she believes the timing of the new campaign was "rather good" because of the amount of time parents now spend with their children.
Analysts have expressed concern that consumers are getting tired of the ever-growing toy-collecting campaigns of the biggest supermarkets, but Ronson says no signs of fatigue are yet seen.
"We haven't seen anything like this yet, but we're always keeping our eyes open for this," she said.
“We analyze a lot of data, from week to week, month to month, to make sure that what we give away finds harmony with our customers.
It was Cloes who paved the way for fundraising campaigns such as Little Shop in Australia, the first of which in mid-2018 was the driving force behind the best quarterly supermarket sales from the start.
Woolworths followed suit with Lion King Oosheis, which also helped the supermarket grow its sales, and most recently, the environmentally friendly Discovery Garden promotional campaign offers customers free herbs and flowers for planting.
However, the new fundraising campaign could have less impact this time around as UBS analysts forecast increased sales at supermarkets in Australia during most of the 2021 financial year.
Ronson said customers can expect more diverse fundraising campaigns in the future, and that campaigns such as Little Shop will most likely be less frequent.
“There’s a lot of fundraising campaigns around the world that we look at, and we’re constantly getting inspiration from other countries,” she said.
“We need to do that to make sure we’re doing better with our customers.”
I’ve had five trips around the country this summer.
The photographer and fabricator Jón Ragnar Jónsson, often known as Jon From Iceland has been more or less a wanderer around Iceland since the pandemic hit.
Jón completed his undergraduate studies in business at the University of Reykjavík a few years ago, but is now working to travel and produce marketing materials for individuals and companies.
The summer started early with Jon, or in April, when he went on a trip all over the Westfjords and stayed in his car.
For the rest of the year, he has made about five or six laps around the country.
In addition, he has taken countless day trips here and there.
What journey has come up?
“For someone like me who is always on the move and has seen everything, it’s hard to name a favorite place.
It’s more the weather and the company that matters.
It has been a long time since the roads opened in June.
They are always on the road because there is so much adventure to be had.
The last trip there is possibly our favorite trip of the year, but then we went 25 together on 5 large cars up by Fljótshlíð and from there to álftavatn."
What’s ahead for you this summer?
“It’s very exciting for me, but I just finished a diving course with DIVE and now I’m taking diving trips here and there around Iceland.
Then I added a surfboard to my "dota box" so I'll be more into the sea than before.
I’m going on a 10-day “solo” trip with everything I need behind my back, but it’ll be revealed later in the summer wherever I go.
Otherwise, I’ll be in a lot of high ground in the near future as it’s not possible to explore that area all year round.”
What is your favorite place in Iceland?
“It’s always hard to choose one place, but it’s been a part of my life since I can remember.
My family and I went to a farm every summer at the foot of Breiðamerkurjökull, and since then I have always felt good in that area.
“I think I’ve been there more than a hundred times.”
What places in Iceland do you recommend people visit?
“I’m going to bring one pearl from each part of the country, but there are: Mulaguljúfur in South Iceland, Stuðlagil in East Iceland, Aldeyjarfoss in North Iceland, Rauðasandur in Westfjords, Snæfellsjökull in West Iceland and last but not least... Mælifell on Hálendi.”
What is essential for the journey?
“I don’t go out on land unless I have the following in my car: a good flashlight, a hammock, a loafer, a knife, a firecracker, a cooler, and a sledgehammer...those who know me know what I’m talking about.”
Search for 24 Rohingya people who are afraid of drowning off an island in Malaysia
COPENHAGEN, Malaysia (AP) – Authorities in Malaysia said on Sunday that 25 Rohingya refugees feared drowned after jumping off a boat off the tourist island of Langkawi, northern Malaysia.
Zawawi Abdullah, a senior official with Malaysia's National Security Service, said that initial police information showed that only one of the 25 Rohingya men who had jumped off the boat had been able to swim to shore.
The man who survived sought police assistance late Saturday and has been detained while the case is being investigated further, according to Zawawi.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslim Rohingya have fled Myanmar due to military action, many of whom live in overcrowded refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Muslims are the majority of the population in Malaysia, which has been a frequent destination of boat parties promising refugees a better life in another country.
Zawawi said that two ships and aircraft were used in the search.
He said that the Coast Guard will also alert the area's sailors and authorities in neighboring Thailand so that they can assist in the search.
He gave no further information about the boat.
Last month, authorities in Malaysia detained 269 Rohingya refugees and found bodies aboard a boat suspected of being used for smuggling off the coast of Langkawi, but they claimed he was deliberately damaged so he could not go back to sea.
Malaysia's Coast Guard later said that the 269 individuals had been transported from a larger ship with dozens of people believed to have died and that their bodies were thrown into the sea.
Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said Malaysia could not accept more Rohingya refugees as it is struggling with economic depression due to the coronavirus pandemic.
He said, however, that those already in the country would not be sent back out to sea.
In Malaysia, more than 2 million illegal immigrants live in addition to about 180,000 refugees and asylum seekers – including 101,000 Rohingya – who are registered with the United Nations Refugee Agency.
Residents of Aswan collect, monitor and return cargo of chocolate to Sudan after a car crash
A transport vehicle bound for Sudan carrying many tons of chocolate rolled on the international road between Aswan and Abu Simple on Sunday, at the intersection with the village of Wadi Karkar, when the driver fell into a coma due to a heat stroke.
The townspeople rallied to assist the driver as he lay and rescued the goods that had been stolen.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, expressed his view that the driver was "passing our village; we couldn't just stand by.
We have to help people in need, no matter where they come from.”
He added that villagers had arrived on an ambulance to pick up the driver and then tried to save the cargo of the truck, valued at three million Egyptian pounds.
Bahr said the villagers had been at the scene from morning to night, saving as much of the cargo as they could.
"What we thought was most important was saving the driver's life, protecting the cargo and reopening the international road," he said.
The villagers were willing to provide water and shelter for the injured driver, Bahr said, adding that they just wanted to make sure he could get to and from the village safely.
There were already crooks in the Senate. The coronavirus could make them worse.
"The pandemic alone is a call to our elected representatives for the leadership and vision we expect in times of difficulty," said a report prepared from an interview series held by Leonard Steinhorn, professor of communications at American University, and Mark Sobol, author and expert in organizational development and management.
“But we also face other debt defaults that revolve around the inherited sin of our people and the racial inequality that has plagued our country since its founding.”
The study examines familiar topics associated with the deplorable state of parliament: the lack of real inter-party relations, the agenda that limits opportunities for communication, the excessive compression of power in leadership positions, the constant demands for funding, the determination of inter-party cooperation, the negative effects of the media biases on the functioning of the parliaments.
It is also warned that Congress is moving more into the cyberspace as a result of the pandemic, as such a system, which allows elections with the help of deputies in a House of Representatives without the need for delegates to travel to Washington, could still exacerbate the existing problems.
If the idea of teleconferencing reaches a foothold, it would be a serious setback for efforts to increase inter-party communication, according to the report.
"The pandemic caused the Congress to be forced to move most of its activities to the Internet and we certainly understand why," the report says.
“But even if it was necessary, it should not be interpreted as a virtue.”
The document states that the parliament needs "more but not less communication between members of parliament, face to face".
They need to study each other's districts better, have polite conversations to find common ground, and build relationships based on trust that can lead to increased understanding and solutions."
The call for courtesy was particularly relevant this week, when Ted Yoho, a Republican congressman from Florida, attacked Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York with remarks, and his fellow Republican Party members banded together to attack Liz Cheney, a Republican congressman in Wyoming.
Senator Val Demings Talks About Vice President's Office, Lets Trump Hear It For Graces
Senator Val Demings (democrats, Florida) was not shy about discussing her interest in serving as vice president in Joe Biden's possible government and expressing sincere gratitude for being admitted to the office.
This respected member of the black parliamentary group was interviewed by BlackPressUSA live for the #FIYAH! live show and told about her story, her energy and the commitment that has put her in the place she is today, starting with the words "You know all my story. I grew up as a daughter of a maid and a housekeeper in Jacksonville".
Demings was one of four attorney generals in the January trial of Donald Trump in the Senate.
Regardless of whether the Senate acquits Trump, it will be recorded in history that he is the fourth president to be charged.
In an interview with NPR of his office at Capitol Hill, this former Attorney General was quoted as saying: "Was this worth it? This has been worth every single day".
She added that although the ruling had been disappointing, Democrats would have been required to follow suit after its outcome.
In the interview, Demings clearly stated that she opposes Trump's pardon of Roger Stone's prison sentence, who was convicted of lying before Congress (adding to other crimes) as well as his pardon of other criminals convicted of similar crimes, as she said "The lack of modesty to reach your friends, those who have lied and cheated".
Deamings is at the top of Joe Biden's list of potential candidates for Vice President, which also holds Karen Bass Chairman of the CBC (Democrats, California), Stacey Abrams former Georgia Senator, Senator Kamala Harris (Democrats, California) and Tammy Duckworth (Democrats, Illinois), Keisha Lance Bottom's second mayor
However, she noted that only one person would decide who bids with Joe Biden this fall.
"It's Joe Biden."
Then she put her hand to her mouth as she laughed and pretended to whisper to those watching the live broadcast, adding "If you want to call ... you can do it for me".
There is no doubt that, regardless of the political views of each, history books will regard this period as a time when developments in American politics and attitudes occurred.
This did not happen to Demings.
She mentioned that the number of women coming forward for a run for vice president of the United States is an opportunity to break through the rest of the "glass roof" – especially for women of African descent.
“It’s precisely these opportunities that I work so hard all my life to create for young boys and girls who have heard that their color is wrong, that they don’t have enough money or that they are of the wrong gender,” she said.
The congresswoman resolved to ensure that the Democratic Party National Committee and Biden's election team would advertise and work with the Black Press of America to get as many people to vote as possible.
“I’m going to call Tom Perez (Democrat Party chairman) and I’m going to put this at the top of my list,” Demings said.
She agreed that this would have to happen now rather than later in the campaign.
When she responded to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's words that Trump might refuse to leave the White House, he loses the election, and another editorial saying that the president is preparing to pardon himself, came alive over the Demings: "So much that suggests pardoning myself makes me uncomfortable".
But who would ever do that other than Trump?
I think he hates this job.
It is not possible to break the law and ignore the Constitution in this work.
I think he hates the job, but he hates losing.
I can totally believe that the president won't want to leave the White House, but we have our way of taking care of it, and if that happens, I just want to be with those on a team that makes it happen."
Bottles on foot for children
There are bottle heads for those children who want to toast their parents from an early age in bottles that fit the table on better days.
Now there are no doubt some parents who are celebrating, or those parents who have been bored with childish ornaments.
But it’s not just the children who pick up their parents’ glasses, because they find it more exciting to see on their feet.
This glass was found on the site modernhouseessentials.com, which contains various gems.
The bottles have a good nozzle, stable foot and tolerate well heat - therefore, kids can enjoy the soak whether it is hot or cold.
Each bottle holds about 150 ml.
Those who want to take a closer look at the bottles can visit the website HERE, but the bottles are on sale these days at a small ISK 3,400 Icelandic.
Jack Ma and Alibaba have filed a lawsuit against a former employee in Gurugram.
Gurugram, July 26: The company Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma, have been tried in Gurugram after a former employee of the company claimed that he had been fired for protesting censorship and fake news in the company's programs.
The case is dealt with in Gurugram District Court, and private court judge Sonia Sheokand has issued a policy for Alibaba, Jack Ma and more than 10 others, asking them to appear in court on July 29, according to news.
The judge has also requested written answers from the company, according to Reuters.
Parmar, who served at UC Web's office in Gurugram until October 2017, is claiming US$268,000 in damages according to court documents.
“We stand by the company’s commitment to the Indian market and the well-being of its employees, and its policies are in line with applicable law.
We cannot comment on the ongoing litigation," said UC India in a statement.
"The lawsuit also includes a 'list of sensitive words' containing passwords in Hindi and English such as 'the border of India and China' and the 'war between China and India' claimed in the lawsuit that UC Web uses to censor content on its systems in India," according to Reuters.
Last month, the Department of the Interior banned 59 Chinese mobile apps, including UC News and UC Browser, in line with increased tension between the two countries.
New York City firefighter's representative says it's "absolutely" okay to exempt a white firefighter from honors
A representative who deals with issues of diversity at the New York City Fire Department says it is "absolutely" okay to keep a white firefighter from honorifics so that flag bearers can all be black, according to a new report.
White firefighter Daniel McWilliams has filed a racial discrimination suit after he was taken from a group of flag bearers at a memorial mass in November 2017 to commemorate fallen members of the Vulcan Society, a fraternity of black firefighters.
The fire department's chief officer for diversity and accessibility, attorney Cecilia Loving, further defended the decision in the New York State Department of Human Rights hearing, according to the New York Post.
McWilliams is one of the department's three firefighters whose historic image is seen lifting the U.S. flag at Ground Zero in the days following the September 11 attacks.
According to McWilliams's complaint, the Fire Department's staff had chosen him to be one of the flag bearers in honor of the memorial.
Being a flag bearer at this ceremony was a "great honor and privilege" for McWilliams, according to the lawsuit, according to CNN.
However, when he attended the ceremony, he was barred from participating in the medal of honor by the then president of the Vulcan Society, Regina Wilson, for it is claimed she had asked that all flag bearers at the Mass be black.
She then asked McWilliams – a 29-year-old employee of the New York City Fire Department – to help in another way."
Among the claims that she asked him to do is to provide escorts for civilians and set up uniformed firefighters away from the mass.
McWilliams claims in his lawsuit that he asked Wilson if she was taking him from the Medal of Honor because he was not black.
She confirmed that it was so, he said.
Wilson, who has served with the New York City Fire Department for 21 years and who also took part in the September 11 rescue effort, will have replaced McWilliams with one of the members of the Vulcan Society.
McWilliams claims he left the memorial "to spare further embarrassment, humiliation, and shame," as friends and colleagues heard what went on between them, according to the New York Daily News.
When Loving, who is black, testified in court, McWilliam's attorney, Keith Sullivan, asked her the following: "So asking for everyone to be black in honor is not discrimination?"
"No, it's not," said Loving, according to the New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Loving if it was okay to ask that everyone be black in honor, to which she replied, "Absolutely."
Loving explained that it was okay to replace a white person with a black person to "hedge up our uniqueness and different origins to create pride, solidarity and support for each other".
McWilliams first filed a racial discrimination lawsuit with the New York City Fire Department in January 2018.
He then filed a lawsuit against Wilson, the New York City Fire Department, New York City, and unnamed individuals in May 2019.
Sullivan said that after McWilliams filed his complaint, Wilson's supporters retaliated against him and threatened him.
At one point, one of her supporters will have laid hands on McWilliams, saying, "I've heard about you, they told me you'd behave like that, and now you know who I am."
In an excerpt, Sullivan wrote that it had been "horrible" to exclude McWilliams from honors at the Mass and a sign that one did not apply to everyone at the fire department.
"If you're a black person and you discriminate against a white person in the workplace, you get a reminder at most," Sullivan said.
Wilson, according to the lawsuit, was "advised for one hour" because of her treatment of McWilliams.
Meanwhile, a white person who discriminates against a black person receives a "harsh punishment", Sullivan wrote.
"The New York City Fire Department has created a policy and process designed to please members of the Vulcan community, who act in a racist manner, excuse their actions and help them ... and this needs to stop," Sullivan also wrote.
He threatened the pedestrians and demanded money.
One was arrested in the city centre after an attempted robbery, threatening a pedestrian and trying to get money from the person.
The man was in a prison cell.
Police reported a man with a knife in the city.
The knife was confiscated and a report taken by the person concerned.
More than eighty cases entered the table of police in the capital area from 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. and this morning six were saved in a prison cell.
Stopped police including a driver of a car who pulled a caravan on Kjalarnes where the caravan's bicycle equipment was in very bad condition.
The trailer was stationary and its owner intended to provide transportation equipment to transport it to the town.
The police then stopped the production of drugs in the town.
Two people were arrested for the incident and were released.
There were also reports of individuals firing fireworks in the town.
They had escaped from the scene when police arrived at the scene "until they probably knew the shame of it as it is still quite a long way in the year ahead."
Thousands of Khabarovsk residents still demand the resignation of Putin
Thousands of city residents gathered the Russian city of Khabarovsk yesterday and protested the arrest of the district governor of the same province in the south of Eastern Russia and the inauguration of his successor, who has never lived in the region.
The former district governor, Sergei Furgal, enjoys great popularity and tens of thousands of city residents protested when he was arrested and placed in custody in Moscow earlier this month, accused of ordering the murder of three businessmen fifteen years ago.
In the recent week, Furgal was formally dismissed as district governor and his 39-year-old party brother, Mikhail Degtyarev, was appointed in his place, at the low affection of the locals.
Is Degtaryev said inexperiencedly and, worse, without any connection with Khabarovsk and called the city residents after his resignation the quickest.
The call Degtaryev has made as wind through the ears rush.
Yesterday's protesters were little fewer than in the first protests, or fifteen to twenty thousand, and the demands were the same as before: the liberation of Furgal and the resignation of Vladimir Putin, President of Russia.
"We want the governor to be released, because we think his arrest is highly likely to be illegal," the AFP news agency has quoted a half-thirty protester, Alina Slepova.
She claims that Kremlin agents had Furgal arrested "to defend their own interests, but not the interests of the region."
Police in Khabarovsk left protesters unharmed despite the claim being a clear violation of the current convention ban due to the Coronavirus pandemic.
In Moscow, however, police arrested at least ten people who gathered in Pushkin Square to show support to protesters in Khabarovsk, the Guardian reports.
Furgal's group, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, is a group of hardline nationalists, and is considered by political commentators to be quite dedicated to the Kremlin government in most matters.
However, the same political commentators inform the BBC that Furgal's victory in the district governor's election two years ago – which was great and unambiguous – was a considerable shock to Putin and United Russia, and although there are indications that the capture of Kremlins in the eastern regions was weakening.
Furgal was arrested on July 9 and taken to Moscow, where he is awaiting trial.
He is charged with ordering three murders in 2004 and 2005.
Two of them were gone, but the third was gone.
Sarah Rainsford, a correspondent for the BBC in Moscow, tells Furgal's followers, who are enjoying great popularity at home, convinced that the charge and the arrest have political roots.
They want to know why the government has been waiting to arrest him until now, says Rainsford, 15 years after his alleged offence.
Tree branches gave way when Hurricane Hanna struck South Texas
Hurricane Hanna fell to the strength of a tropical storm after it hit the southern coast of Texas on Saturday, July 25, but authorities warned that the storm could still cause flash floods.
The U.S. Bureau of Weather said heavy rainfall was the greatest threat in southern Texas and northeastern Mexico as the storm moved west-southwest on Sunday.
Jorge Castillo shared this video on Twitter, telling Storyful that he had taken it outside his home in Combes, Texas, on Sunday morning.
Homeless women with disabilities join the fight against COVID-19 in Chennai
Shanthi, a disabled woman educated as a dressmaker, visits 250 homes every day to identify people with symptoms in Kodambakkam, a large Covid infection area in Chennai, where around 10,000 cases have been identified.
The workday begins early with her, at 7:30, and ends at about 4 p.m.
It measures the heat in the population, asks about symptoms, and teaches them about the importance of wearing masks, washing their hands regularly, and keeping a distance from others.
Her work has even led to the diagnosis and treatment of infection in time in four positive individuals.
Shanthi is one of 16,000 Chennai City employees who do the homework but are not health professionals.
The project has reportedly contributed to a reduction in positive cases by 50 percent, in the daily count of Chennai, while increasing in other regions of Tamil Nadu.
Shanthi says that not all of the residents are cooperative.
She adds: “Most people are cooperative when a woman with a disability approaches them.
Some people get annoyed.
But this is not to worry.
I think people should be safe.
When I return the next day, the people are courteous.
It helps build a good relationship.”
And there are more women like Shanthi who stay in the city's hostel for women with disabilities and put up a fight against the Covid-19 team.
Not far from Kodambakkam, Kavitha, who also has a disability, has also participated in the effort as a caretaker.
Although Kavitha has a specially equipped bike, she starts walking to meet people and holds her hedges.
"I'm happy," she says of a reduction in infection, but adds: "I want to see them go down to maybe about 100 a day.
I’m sure we can get it.”
On the first floor of the hostel where the two live are Matilda Funceca, a basketball player who uses a wheelchair, and Manimekalai who is a teacher, and they send all the data received from approximately 40 women into the web server of Chennai city.
Matilda says she is not afraid to be infected by the coronavirus.
“When we help others, God protects us,” she adds.
When asked what measures she takes, Manimekalai says: “I wear a mask, keep my distance, and wash my hands often.
I also drink Kabasura Kudineer, a siddha drink that boosts the immune system."
A few months ago, when the coronavirus first arrived in Chennai, these disabled women spent their time and talents sewing masks for health professionals in the city.
Dr. Aishwarya Rao and the director of the shelter, as well as the Dorcas Research Center that operates the shelter, say: “They adapt to the needs of each moment.
Before, there was a need for masks, and then they did not leave their own.
Now it's time to intervene in the community and they responded to the call."
Coronavirus infection in Tamil Nadu has now reached 200,000 after 6,989 new cases in the past 24 hours, but it is also the largest number of infections detected in a single day, according to official data.
Eighty-nine have died and 7758 have recovered in the past 24 hours.
The total number of infections in the state is now 206,737.
Police try to find out the last trips of a teenager in Helensburgh
Detectives investigating the death of a teenage boy in Helensburgh are now trying to compile a timeline of his last journeys.
The body of 19-year-old Kirk Allan was found in a Johnson Court home at about 6:25 a.m. on Saturday.
A 30-year-old man was arrested and police confirmed on Sunday that he had now been charged in connection with the death.
He will appear in court in Dumbarton on Monday.
Police Inspector Steve Martin said: “Our thoughts are with Kirk’s family and friends at this difficult time.
Police officers will continue to work with the community and provide support.
Our research focuses on getting a full picture of what took place, especially Kirk's travels in the last days before his death, however we are not looking for anyone else in relation to the death."
South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox share their experiences of discrimination
In recent weeks, it has become clear that many skeletons are still in the closet in relation to racial discrimination in sports in South Africa.
Upbuilding dialogues need to take place and action is needed to ensure that everyone is welcome in sports.
Ashwell Prince, a former cricket star at the Proteas, made his white former teammates hear it and accused them of racial prejudice by saying he and other black team members are "quote players".
Prince said black players of the Proteas have been officially named "quota players" by their white teammates.
He added that it was sad that even though black players such as Makhaya Ntini and now Kagiso Rabada reached the top rankings in the sport, some people still connected them to the quota debate.
Prince, who is now the coach of the Cape Cobras team, made this comment at a United Coalition for Sport and Community Based Organizations (UCSCBO) web meeting on Thursday night.
The organization's goal is to continue the fiery debate on historical racial discrimination in South African sports.
“As I said when I took off on social media, it’s not my intention to come and pull people’s names down, but these are real incidents.
“You’re doing everything right, but you’re still getting infected.”
Paul Roberts, a former musician and craftsman who became a programmer at NASA, now works at a software company.
He and his wife, a former nurse at the Methodist Hospital who sees herself as an optimist, ran an online amateur magazine and attended Comic Con events earlier in the year.
Once a week, they puzzle with their two daughters, a son-in-law and a 7-year-old grandson and play a thrilling Uno game.
"They're amazing nerds," says Roman, 38, about his parents.
Sheryl Roberts, 65, is aware of the dangers of the pandemic – she has diabetes, asthma, and heart disease that can put her at increased risk.
Her husband has chronic lung disease and a supporting leg that keeps the previously blocked coronary artery open.
"We've been so careful, very careful, and kept away from people," said Sheryl Roberts.
Her husband started working from home in the spring, when the epidemic ravaged Washington State, New York, and other areas across the country.
Paul has occasionally gone to a supermarket in "old age" time, and their only real date over the past month was, according to Sheryl, when they started looking at wildflowers through the car window.
Their younger daughter was also careful.
But then she came home squeaking from work one day in mid-June and thought she was allergic.
Soon she developed cough, fever, headache, and diarrhea, and lost all sense of taste and smell, which are typical symptoms of the coronavirus.
"She said, 'I don't know what's going on, Mom, but I had a mask, I had gloves, I had my hands washed,'" Sheryl said.
“You’re doing everything right, but you’re still getting infected.”
Elaine Roberts, who was diagnosed with positive coronavirus infection, did not become seriously ill.
Things got worse for her parents.
Paul Roberts and his wife started to sneeze and then cough, just like their daughter, and then got heat and a lot of pain in the body.
Then he became "difficultly ill, disciplined quickly," said Sheryl Roberts.
On June 22, he became confused.
He was worried about his oxygen level.
It was low, and she asked their older daughter to take him to an emergency room, for the second time in two days.
The former royal couple felt it was "ignored" in the Queen's Christmas speech, according to a new book
MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry found his grandmother, the Queen of the United Kingdom, has "swallowed" them in her Christmas speech.
The couple's new biography, "Finding Freedom", states that they were found overlooked in the gallery that could be seen in the Christmas talk.
Images on the desk that the Queen sat at included Prince William, Kate Middleton and their three children, Prince Charles and his wife Camilla as well as Prince Philip.
But Meghan and Harry were nowhere to be seen despite Archie having been born in May, yet the boy was mentioned as her "eighth great-grandson".
The new book, released in August, also states that Meghan and Kate Middleton "were never friends" as they "didn't get over superficial politeness" and only met a few times.
Yesterday, it was claimed that Harry and his brother's discord began some years before his relationship with Meghan began, but that it peaked due to William and Kate Middleton's marriage.
The Duke of Sussex felt he was a "warrior" at events with his brother and Kate Middleton, and it is claimed that "he wanted to change things long before Meghan came along".
Conservative Party MPs accuse labor leaders of wanting to keep public employees "at home forever".
Conservative Party MPs accuse labor leaders of wanting public workers to be "home forever", after the leaders protested Boris Johnson's call for people to return to work
Labour leaders were accused of wanting workers to "stay home forever" after they protested Boris Johnson's call to people to return to work.
Members of the Conservative Party were angered when the union of public and public employees told their members to ask at their feet when their bosses ordered them to return to their places of work.
Former Minister Andrew Percy said it was "unacceptable" that essential public services such as the issuance of passports were halted while staff in the general market had worked hard to keep the community going during the coronavirus pandemic.
"It is unacceptable that people refuse to return to their jobs while workers in warehouses and factories across the country have continued to work so that public employees could eat while this has been going on," he said.
“Many of these employees now want to go on holiday but cannot because of the people who refuse to go back to their places of work, even if they are safe.
Labour leaders cannot maintain this policy of staying home forever – especially now that we know people can return to work safely."
Following a call by the Prime Minister last week, Alex Chisholm, the newly appointed Chief Operating Officer of the Public Service, announced that the Ministry was to "displace public service workers from working from home, and expedite their return to their places of work until 1 August".
The union of public and public employees expressed to its members, who number about 200,000 people, that they would not have to face this demand, and said this was about politics.
A spokesman for the union of public and public employees, the largest union of public employees in the UK, said that the requirement to return to work was "not put forward with the health and safety of our members at the forefront, or to boost the economy.
This is solely done due to political pressure from Conservative Party MPs who demand that public services be used as an example to get others back to work.
Our recommendations to members are clear: if you do your job at home and someone in your department asks you to come back to the workplace, don't take it as a matter of course that you need to do it."
The controversy stems from growing dissatisfaction with the delayed release of passports due to staff working at home, but about 400,000 people are now said to be waiting for the processing of their applications.
The Interior Ministry has now released that it will "seek to speed up" applications from the UK for travel over the next two weeks, and from those who have been waiting for a passport release for more than four weeks.
The union of public and general employees has admitted that some people had to wait up to 143 days for passports, but claims that "small and often cramped offices" make 4000 staff of the passport service difficult to keep the necessary distance.
The former government minister, David Davis, urged union leaders to "behave wisely" and seek ways to cooperate with the government to bring people back into their workplaces.
He added that if he was in government, he would ask a union leader: “What do you want? That people stay home all summer?”
However, some of the UK's largest companies have also ignored Johnson's recommendation to people to return to work.
A study of larger workplaces with a total of about 400,000 employees found that only about 40,000 of them have returned to their workplaces.
Focusing on the story can play an important role
The gulf has widened, but understanding and reconciliation should be the goal.
The school system is partly to blame for this lack of knowledge and understanding.
Too little is taught of Australian history.
The fact is that without radical action, the only teaching piece that specifically addresses our history – the 'History of Australia' for Grade 12 – will die out within the next five years or even sooner.
Last year, only 628 students in the state of Victoria completed their studies in the history of Australia out of a total of 49,324 who completed primary school, or just 1%.
Over the past six years, this number has almost decreased by half, but nearly 100 fewer students enroll in the profession each year.
The main reason why so few students choose to learn about the history of Australia in 12th grade is that little has been done in previous years of study to arouse their interest.
History is not even a unique field of study, but it falls under the broader 'science of thought'.
Therefore, students in the 7th and 8th grades only complete one short unit of "primary and island beards on the Torres Strait and their culture".
In the 9th and 10th years there is a second unit of Australia in the World Wars.
For many students in Victoria, this is all that is taught about the history of Australia in the elementary school years.
In Year 9 and 10, there is another optional unit for the period 1750-1918.
It is urgent to take three actions to save Australian history in Victorian State schools.
First, history must become an independent field of study, like English, mathematics, and science.
Since history is taught only as part of the humanities, it receives little space in the curriculum.
It is usually taught by people who have a general education in the field of cognitive science but have not trained in history.
Historical skills such as the analysis of information are complex.
We must hire more specialized history teachers to ensure that such skills are taught in an accessible and exciting way.
Third, the history of Australia from 1788 to 1914 must become a compulsory branch.
Students appreciate what they know.
So many of my former students chose not to learn the history of Australia in their 12th year of study because then they would have had to learn the material from scratch.
Knowledge of history alone does not bridge the deep gulf between races.
But without her, as can be clearly seen in the Victorian State curriculum, the project is hopeless.

Aron Elís in the final of the European Championship - Asaki parted ways in the half
Aron Elís Thraindarson has reached the final of the European Football Championship.
Isak Bergmann Jóhannesson played only the first half with Norrköping's top team against Falkenberg's bottom team in Sweden.
Aron Elís was a member of OB's team in Denmark when the team advanced to the final for a place in the European League premiership.
OB will face AGF or FC Köbenhavn in the final, but it depends on whether the teams finish above after the final round of the top half of the Danish Premier League later today.
Aron Elís played the entire game in a 1-1 draw with Horsens on the outfield today, but OB had won the teams' previous game at home, 3–1, and therefore won the single in a total of 4 to 2.
Isaac was in Norrköping's starting team which was unexpectedly 2-4 under after the first half against Falkenberg's bottom team in the Swedish Premier League.
Norrköping made a triple split at the start of the second half and Isaac was one of those who had to give way.
Norrköping managed to equalize the score, but Falkenberg came in 3–1 in the 89th minute.
However, it was still time for Norrköping to equalise at the last minute, 3-4.
Norrköping remains at the top, with 24 points, four points ahead of Elfsborg and five points ahead of Malmö, which has a good match later today.
The score was enough for Falkenberg to get off the bottom for the time being, but the team is a level above Helsingborg and Kalmar who have a good game to play.
Collects records of the National Day of Coronavirus
Anna Lilja Sigurðardóttir founded the Facebook group "My National Festival 2020" to gather sources about the national festival that the Islanders are planning to hold next weekend.
Many will camp in their gardens and rejoice with friends and relatives.
Anna Lilja talked to Hvata in the show Weekend on the Wave.
“There’s nothing coming in yet that’s very exciting, too, because there are 600 people in the group, so obviously people are going to do something,” says Anna Lilja.
Something about the Islanders going to have camp parties at home in the yard.
“People have talked about having their own [festival], maybe camping in the park and hooking up with the family like they always do at this time,” Anna says.
“People think they’re going to spend time with their friends.
However, she likely says that many people will simply not be on the spot "but still to hold some little National Festival somewhere else."
The National Festival Committee is now working hard to refund the tickets purchased, but Anna believes many locals would rather secure tickets for next year's festival.
“People are even investing now in the tickets and making them valid for 2021.”
“I’m a big festival person, I love the preparation and everything about it, but sometimes something comes into your life that you don’t control and that’s just the way it is,” Anna says.
Anna Lilja says that she has not founded the group for herself or to encourage people to keep their own National Festival, but rather to collect information about the National Holidays in the Islands this year.
What did people do at this strange time?
I'm not going to use this for one thing or anything but then come to the point of someone using such sources for something but I was just creating some area where people can put in what they're doing."
There is also a fire at the fire station, which is lit every year.
“I think a lot of people are excited about Friday night.
The only thing that obviously makes a mark in the account is that the prediction is no specs."
"It will be lit in this fire but it will just have to be revealed how it will be," says Anna Lilja.

Will Prince Andrew be mentioned in new sexual assault lawsuits?
The British royal family is now preparing to respond to possible new information in court documents about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
U.S. judge orders secret documents about Epstein and Maxwell to be made public
Among the things found in these 80 pages of documents are parts with Maxwell's testimony as of 2016
The publication of these pages could also put a lot of pressure on Prince Andrew, as they contain communications between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015
Virginia Roberts, the alleged sex slave of the disgraced U.S. financier, claimed in 2015 in court documents that she had been forced to have sex with Prince Andrew.
Prince Andrew is now preparing to defend against the possible publication of information this week with even more damaging allegations of his friendship with child molester Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.
U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska this week ordered the publication of 80 secret legal documents relating to Maxwell and Epstein counting hundreds of pages.
The publication of these enormous documents would be a shock to the 58-year-old Maxwell, as they have been holding large portions of her testimony before lawyers in 2016, including what her lawyers have said are "ongoing questions" about her sex history.
They could also put a lot of pressure on Prince Andrés, with one of the documents containing communications between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts, the alleged sex slave of the disgraced American financier, claimed in 2015 in court documents that she had been forced to have sex with Andrés three times.
Andrew has repeatedly and unequivocally rejected these claims.
A 2015 e-mail that has been leaked and the BBC published last year seems to indicate that Andrés asked Maxwell for help responding to Robert's claims.
We are in no doubt that the duke will receive a sedition
There, he told the upper-class woman: “Let me know when we can talk. I have certain questions I need to ask you about Virginia Roberts.”
Maxwell replied, “I have information. Call me when you have a free moment.”
Last night, a source close to Andrew said: “The Duke of Jórvík has done nothing wrong, so we are not concerned about the opening of court documents.
As the courts in the United States have endeavored to point out, this does not mean that an accusation is true even though it appears in court documents.
U.S. courts have urged the media and the public to exercise the utmost caution in handling allegations made in court documents.
We totally agree with that.
We are in no doubt that the Duke will have a full rebellion in the coming weeks."
Maxwell is now in custody at a Manhattan detention center, awaiting trial for finding and seducing some of Epstein's victims who were underage from 1994 to 1997.
She is also accused of perjury for denying knowledge of reporting his abuse.
She denies all the allegations.
Maxwell last spoke to lawyers in April and July of 2016 in relation to Robert's injury case head, who now goes by the surname Giuffre, which she recorded after her marriage.
About 40 pages out of a total of 418 with that testimony were made public last year, but after the Judge Presna's ruling in New York last week, more parts could be opened at first on Thursday.
Maxwell's lawyers were given one week to file an appeal.
Epstein was found dead in his jail cell in New York last year while awaiting trial for sexual misconduct.
Police search for criminal gangs after violent attack on Edinburgh streets
Three men attacked a man in Edinburgh, causing him injuries that could prove permanent.
The 29-year-old victim was attacked on Drum Street in Gilmerton, between 23:00 and 23:30 on Saturday.
The Scottish Police reported that he had been taken to the Royal Hospital with serious injuries.
Detective Dale Miles, who directs the investigation, said: "It was a violent and unwarranted attack."
The suspects fled towards Newtoft Street.
One of them was thought to be in his 40s, about 180 cm tall and strongly grown.
He was short-cut and dark-haired in a white shirt, dark trousers, and dark shoes.
Detective Miles said, "I'm asking everyone who was in this area when the attack was made and saw something suspicious about turning themselves in."
The ambassador wants to carry a gun in Iceland
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, the US ambassador to Iceland, wants to carry a gun in Iceland and wants to increase security.
He is said to have been "suspicious" about his safety since coming to the country last year.
This is stated in a CBS news report which also states that this is Gunter's will, despite him working in "one of the safest states in the world".
Gunter is said to have asked the U.S. State Department to comply with the Icelandic government that he may carry a gun.
Then he asked for a armored car and a vest that would protect him from knife stabs.
However, CBS officials say the ministry has repeatedly informed Gunter that he is not in danger in Iceland.
According to a CBS report, the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not provide information on whether a request was received from the United States for Gunter's possible weaponry, because the authorities do not comment on the security measures taken by foreign intelligence officers.
However, the sources of the news agency say that no request has been made.
Then CBS has also after its sources that Gunter was told that he should not seek to carry weapons, because it would be taken as an insult in Iceland.
Gunter is an out-of-the-box diplomat who has been a dermatologist in California for years.
He is an active member of the U.S. Republican Party and a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump.
He recently drew attention in this country when he tweeted about the "invisible China virus".
CBS sources also say that Gunter has significantly downgraded the working spirit of the U.S. Embassy in Reykjavík.
He has already had seven second-in-command employees in the embassy since May last year.
He has accused them, among other things, of belonging to the "Deep State" so-called, which is supposed to be a network of American officials working against Trump, and reacted angrily to one carrying snow into his office.
The ambassador travelled to Washington DC in February for a conference and refused to return to Iceland for several months, according to CBS sources.
Gunter is reported to have wanted to work from California, but ultimately, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had to order him to return, and he did so in May.
Jose Mourinho says Tottenham have easier games ahead of them as fans get to come back to the games
With the help of Jose Mourinho, Tottenham Hotspur has not lost a game at home since the Premier League restarted, but he says it would be much easier to maintain a good pace at home if the spectators were allowed to play.
Spurs have won 12 wins at home this season, but lost four times – only one of the six teams above them has lost more at home.
The Portuguese coach said that while such a victory march was possible without the devotees, it would be easier to maintain it if they were on site.
"We have to do this with the fans. Without them you can build some kind of fortress, where the game plan is in the foreground," he said.
"But I think it would be much more powerful to do that with the fans, because then the emotional side of the game will be added, which will only be achieved with the help of fans at the home stadium."
Mourinho believes that with stronger rivals it will be increasingly difficult to maintain the long winning seasons at home that he knows from Chelsea, or that Liverpool have built up over the past three seasons.
But this is also key in determining whether the teams reach their goals at the end of the season, especially in even games and neighbouring teams, where the atmosphere on the field can make a huge difference.
"I think the strategy in the Premier League is that now it's becoming more and more difficult to beat this record, because the teams have become good."
“On the other hand, it’s important to be strong at home and at the end of the season to have a lot of points with home wins.”
“I’m happy with the results of the last home games, without the fans, but we need to get them back.
I see myself winning against Arsenal with the field full of Tottenham fans.
It’s a feeling that’s built up little by little.”
Buyers excited for coveted lifestyle properties in Lovely Banks
"Bigger is Better", is clearly the motto of the new owners of a huge estate in the Lovely Banks neighbourhood, which was recently sold at $1270.
Interested buyers looking for a lifestyle property in close proximity to downtown Geelong flocked to view this 1.35-acre estate, featuring a car shelter for 14 cars, a swimming pool, and views of the Corio River.
Joe Grgic, a real estate agent in Harcourts, North Geelong, said that an offer in the estate that Cuddihy Court 1 had been accepted within 10 days of its launch.

"We received a number of offers from various parties," said Grgic.
“The property was sold to a homeowner who is very excited.”
The estate follows four-roomed houses on two floors, which include a private bathroom large enough to accommodate a sofa.
The new owners have a choice of three living rooms and can make use of a renovated kitchen and an updated outdoor area with views of the swimming pool.
"This lay in how the property was composed, that it was three acres, and that it was in this place," said Grgic.
“Here came interested buyers from Melbourne who were wondering what the property was in the middle of but still with a countryside feel.
"I have people who are missing and buyers who are still looking."
He said the spacious storage area, which includes a double garage and a free standing shelter that accommodates 10-12 vehicles, was perfect for industrialists or for storing caravans and trailers.
His safety is threatened in Iceland.
“Despite being named one of the safest countries in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been paranoid about his safety since coming to Reykjavík last year.”
This is how CBS News's detailed coverage of the US ambassador to Iceland begins, but this imitates CBS's numerous sources from the US Foreign Service.
In CBS's review, it is claimed that Gunter requested that the U.S. State Department provide him with a special permit from the Icelandic government to carry a firearm.
He should also have requested an armored car, as well as he had agreed on ideas for a vest that could protect him from knife-punching attacks.
The U.S. State Department refused to publicly state whether Gunter's safety is actually threatened in Iceland, but according to information from officials, Gunter has been repeatedly stated that he is not in any particular danger.
Despite this, the U.S. Embassy in Iceland recently advertised full-time bodyguards, including in its July 18 issue, but CBS sources claim it is done to soothe Gunter's concerns.
The U.S. Department of State does not comment on any visible security measures in connection with its embassies, but it always states the goal that security is guaranteed in a preventive manner.
The Ministry does not answer questions concerning Gunter's wish to arm himself, and the Icelandic Foreign Ministry does not want to say whether the United States has formally requested that the ambassador may carry a firearm, and usually says that he does not comment on the security of foreign embassies.
However, CBS has stated to its Icelandic sources that the request was never made, and according to three U.S. officials, Gunter was handed over from these plans as they could result in insulting locals in Iceland.
At the same time, CBS’s coverage covers the various problems that have been attached to the US embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed ambassador last year, but he will have already replaced his deputy seven times.
Thus, the first vice-president is said to have long prepared for his work and learned Icelandic only to have been denied the position at the last minute because Gunter "does not read on him" at their first meeting.
His successors have not fared much better under Gunter's management.
State Department officials are said to be aware of the position in the embassy in Iceland, but are reluctant to intervene in cases related to the president's close ties.
In addition to all of this, Gunter is said to be reluctant to follow the various rules of foreign service and respect the order of power.
Gunter traveled to the United States in February to attend a conference in Washington, and is reported to have refused to return to Iceland as a result and allowed his temporary replacement to do his job so months apart, and that in the midst of a pandemic.
Will Gunter has even requested to do his job on the job and said he will not return to Iceland unless the foreign minister himself, Mike Pompeo, specifically requested it.
According to information from the U.S. State Department, Gunter had decided to take personal permission for the conference to end and the coronavirus pandemic stalled his journey even further, but according to CBS sources, numerous within the department have asked Gunter to return to Iceland, but he did not return until May, following Pompeo's contact with him and asked him to return to Iceland.
At the same time, CBS's coverage reports on Gunter's unpopularity in Iceland, particularly in relation to this issue, where he calls the coronavirus "the invisible China virus" and has received much criticism.
Gunter is one of the numerous, virtually inexperienced in the field of foreign service ambassadors who have been appointed during the reign of US President Donald Trump.
Sachin Pilot v Ashok Gehlot; Bharatiya Janata party says government crisis in state; Congress party wants vote
Ashok Gehlot said that if this happened, the Congress Party would need to mount a seat protest outside the Prime Minister's home.
On Saturday, a day after a peaceful protest at Raj Bhawan in Jaipur, Ashok Gehlot, the Chief Minister of Rajasthan, said that if that happened, Congressmen would need to meet with the President and conduct a sit-in outside the Prime Minister's home to end the crisis in the state.
At the meeting of the Congress Party delegates, Gehlot indicated that a vote was planned to be held to check whether the majority of the party's members and fellow delegates were aligned with him in the power struggle.
"He said the government has a majority and wants to go to the vote," said Mahesh Joshi, the main party guard of the Congress Party, after the meeting.
The session was held at a hotel where the delegates supporting Gehlot have stayed for the past few days.
“The Minister of State asked us to be prepared to stay longer in the hotel.
If necessary, he said, he would meet with the president and also hold peaceful protests outside the prime minister's home" said party leader.
Rajasthan's Chief Minister may convene the Congress and have the Congress Party demonstrate its majority, said party leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday, and indicated that the Bharatiya Janata Party's plot to overthrow the government of Ashok Gehlot had been uncovered.
“The country is now governed by law and constitution.
Governments are formed and operate with the mandate of the people.
It has come up with the plot of Bharatiya Janata to overthrow the government of Rajasthan.
This is an insult to the 80 million people of Rajasthan.
The Chief Minister must convene the Congress for the truth to come before the country," said Gandhi in a tweet in Hindi.
Ashok Gehlot, the Chief Minister of Rajasthan, told Congress Party members on Saturday that he was prepared to go to a meeting of the President of India to ensure that what he calls the "conviction of Bharatiya Janata" to delay a declaration of confidence by a vote is not successful.
Gehlot, who protested for many hours at the home of Governor Kalraj Mishra on Friday to push for a parliamentary meeting, met with members of the Congress Party and government on Saturday, and after the meeting, new proposals were built and approved by government.
Mishra asked Gehlot last night to re-submit the parliamentary request, citing six objections.
The proposal will soon be sent to the Governor.
Gehlot has accused the governor of delaying the session as he is "under pressure" to delay the vote, which determines confidence in his government.
When Gehlot met his government, Bharatiya Janata's delegation met with the leadership of the leader Satish Poonia and the leader of the opposition Gulab Chandra Kataria with the governor to discuss the status of COVID-19 in the state.
I got into a car just outside the city.
A traffic jam was needed when a car caught fire just above the golf club Hamar at Borgarnes just before 4 a.m.
According to the fire department in Borgarnes, the fire was successfully extinguished in the car and is now expected to be removed.
Two people were in the car when the fire started due to a technical malfunction in the passenger car, both of them are safe and completely unharmed.
Traffic had to be controlled during firefighting, but heavy traffic is in the area in both directions.
Actress Spencer Grammer given a cut outside a Manhattan restaurant
NEW YORK – Actress Spencer Grammar said he was trying to calm an agitated man when he cut her arm and stabbed her friend in the back outside a New York City restaurant last Friday.
Grammer, who is 36, told US Weekly that she and her friend had done what everyone else would have done in the same situation as they had been trying to prevent the situation from getting worse when they were attacked.
Grammer and her 32-year-old friend sat eating at a patio at The Black Ant in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan around 11:30 p.m.
on Friday when a man approached them and demanded to be served, but then the restaurant was being closed.
Grammer and her friend were injured when they tried to "resolve differences between an unknown male and other local visitors," according to police.
The man ran off the scene after injuring Grammer's right arm and stabbing her friend in the back with an unknown pointed object, police said.
No one has been arrested.
Grammer, speaking in for Summer in the episode "Rick and Morty" and previously starred in the series "Greek" on ABC Family, is the daughter of "Frasier" star Kelsey Grammer and actress Doreen Alderman.
Grammer said that both she and her friend expected to recover quickly.
Neither of them suffered serious internal injuries, she said.
In a statement to US Weekly, Grammer thanked those who responded to the scene and staff of Bellevue Hospital who cheered on them, citing the "unbelievable struggle" of these staff with the coronavirus epidemic.
"It touched us very much to have the opportunity to thank them in person," Grammer said.
"I don't want to be like McGregor and show my money ...
I'm here to help people" – Chimaev after historic night at UFC Fight Island – RT Sport News
Fighting champion Khamzat Chimaev of Russia is now named as the next star of the UFC after signing into the history of Fight Island, but he says he does not aim to flag his wealth in a lavish manner like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev beat Northern Iran's Rhys McKee in their fight in a rut in Abu Dhabi on Saturday night when he defeated his rival when three minutes and 9 seconds were passed of the first round by having his punch hit on the floor.
The victory recorded Chimaev's name in the UFC history books for the shortest time between victories in the modern history of the competition, as only 10 days had passed since he defeated British John Phillips in a similarly decisive manner, then in the middle.
Chimaev, who has a winning ratio of 8-0, received a $50,000 bonus for tonight's performance against McKee and has captured the attention of the MMA world so fully that he is now referred to as "Khalib 2.0", which can be said to be an inevitable comparison due to the high probability between Chimaev's dominance and the UFC champion's easement.
Despite his newfound fame and financial gain, the translated Chimaev has said that he would not be willing to flag his wealth like MMA money engine Conor McGregor or his counterpart in the boxing world, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
“I don’t just do it for myself, I do it for everyone I can help.
“I don’t want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, show my money or anything like that.
I want to help people," Chimaev replied when asked on Fight Island how he would use the bonus.
He has, among other things, attracted the attention of teammate Conor McGregor and active Twitter user Dillon Danis, who wrote on the social media that he could "easily" defeat Chimaev with a resignation.
It did not feature a toxic response from the fighter who goes by the name "Borz", or "wolf" in his native Czech, who said he would "paint Danis with his eyes closed".
Chimaev, who is now living in Stockholm, Sweden after moving to the country at the age of 19, may not be far from his financial power, but he is clearly unafraid to dress up his fighting skills.
"I can kill anyone...
How many fighters are in the vehicular division?
I can paint them all," he said.
“Give me 77 kilos of champions, 84 kilos of champions, I’ll grind them both on the same day.”
Israelis continue to protest Prime Minister's response to the pandemic
JERUSALEM (AP) – Thousands of Israelis protested against the prime minister in many parts of the country on Saturday, and were the largest protest outside the official residence of Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
The protests have been going on for several weeks, but they began due to what critics believe the government's failure to respond to the coronavirus pandemic after initially managing to keep the threat of the virus at bay.
Charges against Netanyahu over corruption have further fuelled the protests.
"Bibi, go home," was on the sign of one of the protesters.
The second card read: "Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his clothes".
Hundreds of protesters also gathered outside Netanyahu's beach house in the wealthy town of Caesarea.
Last week, police used water guns to disperse groups in Jerusalem.
After what has been called the rapid and unorganized reopening of the economy in May, the average number of new cases per day rose to 2000.
The country's economy has been hit by restrictions caused by the virus, and unemployment has increased to almost 20%.
Protesters say the government's financial aid was nowhere near enough.
The protests took place in the shadow of criminal prosecutions of corruption charges against Netanyahu, which began again this month.
Hearings will begin in January.
He is charged with fraud, breach of confidentiality and bribery in a series of scandals.
Hundreds of protesters gather in downtown Los Angeles to show solidarity with protesters in Portland
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) – About 300 protesters gathered in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon in support of a two-month-old movement in Portland, Oregon, where attention is focused on federal police officers after clashes with protesters.
Similar protest meetings took place throughout the United States, including in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York.
The Los Angeles protests were organized by the groups Refuse Fascism and Youth Liberation Front.
The group went to the Los Angeles police headquarters at First Street and Main Street, and then to the metropolitan area detention center.
The participants also moved to the Alameda afrein at Highway 101, but later abandoned it.
Some of the people were seen breaking windows in federal buildings in the downtown area, and futures were written on federal labels.
At least one person was arrested in the protests.
50 people crowd in mosques at Eid festival and no prayer gatherings in Eidgah, say Karnataka government
The festival of Eid-ul-Azha, or Bakrid, takes place on 31 July and 1 August.
The government of Karnataka has issued that only 50 may meet in mosques for prayer because of Eid-ul-Azha, and has banned prayer gatherings in Eidgah and other places because of the coronavirus epidemic.
Guests who wish to pray in mosques must wear masks and keep a distance, according to orders from AB Ibrahim, the Minister of Minority Affairs and Wakf.
The order states that the Hilal Committee has decided that the Eid-ul-Azha festival, also called or Bakrid, is to be held on 31 July in the provinces of Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Kodagu, but on 1 August elsewhere in the state.
The decree states that while prayer gatherings are one of the most important Muslim rituals at the Bakrid festival, such events at Eidgah and other places will be banned due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, prayers will be allowed in mosques provided that no more than 50 people participate at one time.
If more than one person attends the prayer sessions, the Ministry says in the directive.
Prayer meetings may not be held anywhere else, such as meetinghouses, community centers, or the "Shadi Mahal", as stated.
Karnataka authorities allow temples, mosques and other places of prayer to be opened to those who wish to pray from 8 June, provided that good care is taken for COVID-19 transmission.
The U.S. military wants a bodyguard.
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, the U.S. ambassador to Iceland, believes his life is threatened locally and wants to carry a weapon.
At the beginning of 2020, the U.S. Embassy repeatedly advertised for bodyguards "bodyguard" in Icelandic newspapers and actually used the English word bodyguard in the advertisement.
According to Kveik's sources, the main reason these jobs were advertised is that Ambassador Jeffrey Ross Gunter believes his life is threatened in Iceland.
He has spoken to sources in Iceland and abroad who tell the ambassador that he is in great danger and the reason is that he is Jewish.
What the threat is, is not as obvious, but Kveik's interviewers said that Islamic terrorists had been cited as a threat.
CBS television covered the matter on its website this morning and has noted Washington sources that Gunter is being persecuted, demanding to carry weapons himself, to have a stab-proof vest and an armed escort as well as a bulletproof automobile.
According to CBS sources, Gunter has been repeatedly told that there is no threat and that the post-"bodyguard" ad is only for the purpose of suspending Gunter.
According to Kveik's sources, the positions had not been recruited by the end of June, but application deadline expired in February.
According to Kveik's sources, no formal communication has been received from the U.S. Embassy as a result of these changes.
There has been no formal request for increased custody or for a warrant for bodyguards to walk armed around outside the walls of the embassy.
Icelandic law makes it clear that this is not permitted except with special permission from the National Police Commissioner.
Respondents within the control system say no information exists about any kind of threat.
The latest threat assessment by the State Police is somewhat conclusive on terrorist threats.
There are no examples of terrorism in Iceland and there is no evidence that terrorist or extremist groups work here.
According to Kveik’s sources, there are no grounds for authorising the use of weapons by the bodyguards of foreign embassies on the streets of cities and towns in Iceland.
Gunter garnered considerable attention in this country when he shared the US President's tweet, calling COVID-19 the "China virus".
With the thistle he then had the American and Icelandic flag.
Seattle radio host mocked Trump's response to protests saying he now needs to get a gun after Starbucks coffee shop below his apartment was destroyed – RT USA News
Paul Gallant has been given a new perspective on violent protests after mocking U.S. President Donald Trump in June for saying that anarchists were burning and robbing Seattle city.
All that was needed was for the riot to spread closer to the host's home.
"I feel like I need to buy a firearm because this is clearly going to continue to happen," Gallant said on Twitter on Saturday night after he saw that vandals had "destroyed" the Starbucks coffee shop on the bottom floor of his apartment building.
“Enough is enough. It looks like a street party down the street from me. Very angry now.”
The changes were completely different when Trump complained last month that the mayor of Seattle was allowing violent protesters to take over the city.
"These liberal Democrats are flawless," the president said.
"The terrorists are burning and robbing our cities and they just think it's wonderful, even death."
Gallant, who is co-director of the episode "Danny & Gallant" at ESPN's Seattle affiliate radio station, responded with a tweet: "Go through there for curiosity last night and didn't see a burn, robbery, or death. Relax salmon."
Gallant said last night that police had advised residents to stay away from his apartment building as explosives could be found in the damaged Starbucks coffee shop.
He published pictures of the damage and said, "Well done, idiot," and stated that he had also seen a fire several blocks away.
“I don’t know what’s going on, but we’re going to find out.”
The reversal did not pass people mocking Gallant for his earlier views and tweeting messages such as "Just relax salmon," and "Jah, maybe Trump was right."
Jason Rantz, another Seattle broadcaster, said "I guess we'll finally go on this tour we talked about."
Gallant agreed with the joke: "Wake up and saw a lot of people were squealing 'slow on salmon' to me.
He said he stood by his previous claim as he had walked through the CHAZ self-governing area of anarchists and although it would not have been as bad as it had been explained as.
"So there were fires and robberies after all," he said.
White Lines star Laura Haddock, 34, in a residential search with her 28-year-old lover, Tom Rhys Harries
Laura Haddock and her boyfriend, Tom Rhys Harries, started together at the filming location of the show White Lines, which deals with the sighs and buzzes of Ibiza, but in a housing search over the past week, their appearance was a different and quieter, away from the party island's sensuality.
The pair, who play siblings in the popular Netflix series, were seen looking at a magnificent rural farm in Oxfordshire, which is for sale at 1.2 million pounds.
They arrived in the Range Rover area as Laura, 34, drove, wearing jeans and a white shirt, and met a real estate agent who led them on a tour of the five-room house.
On White Lines, which was filmed last fall, Laura played the role of Zoe Walker, who becomes acquainted with Ibiza's darker side when she investigates the murder of her brother, Alex, played by Tom, aged 28.
They did not find out about their relationship until earlier this month, less than a year after the six-year marriage of Laura and Sam Claflin ended, which he is known from the Hunger Games films.
Together, they have a four-year-old son Pip and a two-year-old daughter Margot.
When they announced their divorce last August, Claflin, 34, wrote on Instagram: “I Laura have decided to understand legal separation. We understand in love, friendship and with deep respect for each other, and will continue our cooperation in raising our children.
Laura and Sam first met in 2011 during an audition, and Sam, who has also played in Peaky Blinders, described their 2013 wedding as "arguably some of the greatest achievements of my life".
Before getting her role in White Lines, Laura had starred in the first Inbetweeners film, and in the BBC crime drama The Capture, shown last year, where she played lawyer Hannah Roberts.
Tom had a role in the second Inbetweeners film and in the series Brittania from Sky.
It’s too early to talk about another wave in this country.
An expert in the field of infectious diseases at the provincial medical office says it is too early to claim another wave of the epidemic.
Three new inland infections were diagnosed at the Department of Virology yesterday and dozens have been infected.
Two domestic infections were diagnosed on Thursday, one in a man in his twenties and the other in a man in his twenties.
No infection had been detected since the beginning of the month.
Yesterday, three more domestic entrants were identified, one of which had been at the Rey Cup football tournament in Laugardalur.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, an information officer at the state police, says in a conversation with a news agency that fewer people had to take samples because of the infection than was originally thought.
The second infection is in a person who came to the country from abroad on July 15.
Then the rules of so-called return mite had taken effect.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, an expert in the field of infectious diseases at the National Medical Office, says that the person in question, however, followed the old process.
His vision was negative on his arrival in the country, but he then became ill, has come into solitary confinement, and has six been placed in quarantine.
They are all on their way to sampling, but two of them are beginning to show symptoms.
The third infection is then linked to the older man who was diagnosed on Thursday and twelve have been placed in quarantine in connection with it.
It has been revealed that there is a new variant of the coronavirus that has not been detected before in Iceland.
“We don’t know exactly where this virus comes from, but we haven’t seen it before.
He who is believed to have carried the virus to the country had been in Israel but also in other European countries."
It is too early to claim that the so-called second wave of the epidemic has started in this country, as other countries in Europe fear.
“While the majority of these are still traceable, there is no evidence that this is the case.
But we're on our toes and we're watching, thinking of ways to react if something like that could get started."
Megan Fox talks about her relationship
Megan Fox says she has found her twin soul in rapper Machine Gun Kelly.
As soon as I saw him and looked into his eyes, I knew.
I am interested in constellations and I knew immediately that my twin soul was involved," says Fox, who is 34.
"A twin soul is when the soul has reached a level sufficient to allow it to divide into two different bodies at the same time," explained Fox.
“We’re two halves of the same soul, I think.
I told him as soon as we met.
I found it right away.”
“When we had known each other for two days, I asked him to meet me for lunch and I told him about the constellations and asked him about his life.
I decided to go straight to the bottom.”
Machine Gun Kelly is in the same vein, but they met during filming.
“I was hanging out outside her trailer hoping to see her.
She has the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen."
It’s only been two months since Fox divorced her husband, Brian Austin Green.
They have three sons together.
Kanye apologizes to Kim
Kanye West, an American musician and presidential candidate, has apologised to his wife for a statement he made publicly about his family’s personal affairs.
“I want to apologize to my wife Kim for publicly discussing personal matters,” he wrote on Twitter.
There has been a lot of speculation about the status of their relationship, but Kanye has recently gone to a lot of social media and at a mass meeting he held last Monday he discussed, among other things, the birth of his daughter North West, saying he almost killed her.
Then Kim stepped forward on Wednesday and posted a message to her followers on Instagram where she discussed her husband's illness, but he is diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Kardashian West has not previously commented publicly on her husband's illness, saying it was partly because of the couple's children and Kanye's right to privacy when it came to his health.

Anti-racism protests in the United States
Protesters have walked the streets of a number of cities in the United States to draw attention to racial discrimination.
Protests have been going on for two months in Portland, Oregon, since May 25 when George Floyd died in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Trump administration has sent FBI agents to Portland, and thus still fueled the protests.
Opponents are now also objecting to the presence of the federal police officers in the city.
In Seattle on Saturday, police used flare bombs and tear gas and arrested 45 people, after a protest rally in support of the Portland protests dissolved into violence.
According to police, more than 20 police officers were injured.
One died on Saturday night in Austin, Texas, when a gun was fired into a Black Lives Matter march.
Media sources say the man may have walked up to a vehicle armed with a rifle, before he was shot.
"The crux of the matter is that it is appalling that someone should be killed in protest," Austin Mayor Steve Adler said in a statement.
Adler claimed to be "harshly beaten and wordless".
In Lousville, Kentucky, a group of armed protesters demanded justice in the case of Breonna Taylor, a black woman who died in Louisville when police broke into her home, with permission to enter without knocking, and shot her.
Taylor's boyfriend had first fired at the police officers, thinking they were burglars.
One police officer has been sacked due to Taylor's death, but the other policemen have not been charged.
The NFAC group's leadership, an armed group of black rebels who have participated in the protests, calls for more transparency in the police investigation into Taylor's murder.
According to police, three members of the NFAC were injured on Saturday when shots accidentally ran out of weapons by the rebel army.
Possible group infection in the ascent
Five have been diagnosed with COVID-19 infection this week outside of border screening.
Two of the infected were diagnosed with previously unseen variants of the virus, and the origin of three of the five infections seems to be completely unclear.
It is uncertain whether the individuals have been infected by a tourist who has returned from Iceland or the asymptomatic Icelander, who has then probably infected much more.
A local infectious disease doctor says that a possible group infection may be in the process of being associated with one of the infections.
Two people were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the country last Thursday, with their respective types of the virus.
The origin of the infection is still unclear.
Three were then diagnosed with the virus yesterday; one of them has been infected by another of those diagnosed on Thursday, another came to the country on July 15 last and was probably infected outside, but the third also has an infection of unclear origin.
After sequencing in Icelandic genetic analysis, it was found that the two individuals who were diagnosed with the virus and associated with it have a new variant that has not been diagnosed before in Iceland.
Kamilla Jósefsdóttir, an expert in the field of infectious disease at Landverkækni and a substitute for a infectious disease doctor, says that Icelandic genetic analysis is now going over where this type of virus most likely came from.
“The second case was similar to a virus that has been going on in Switzerland, but not quite the same.
They're going to look at this and try to map this out better and lead the likes of which part of the world the infection comes from," she says.
“It looks like it’s on this side of the Atlantic.”
So the infection is unrelated to the two that came up in early July and were traced to the United States.
Do you assume that this new species has come from outside rather than having mutated here domestically?
“Yes, it’s different from what’s been found here before, there’s really no chance it was something wrong here,” Kamilla answers.
“There is every chance that these individuals have somehow come to terms with a person who has just arrived from somewhere outside, without knowing it themselves.”
She said there was no indication yet as to where the new virus might have come from.
“It could naturally be a traveler who has gone out of the country again, but it could also be someone who doesn’t get any symptoms and doesn’t realize that he has been infected, and then there could naturally be more infections.
We’ll be on our toes in the next few days to watch it.”
“So far, nothing has come up that is a smart group infection.
But there are individuals who went into quarantine in connection with one of the infections yesterday, who have symptoms and have already gone into sampling," Kamilla continues.
“We haven’t gotten any results from them yet.
So it could be a group infection in the ascension."
Do you think it’s a community event right now?
“It is not impossible.
It hasn’t been done recently, but it’s not impossible because we don’t know who has carried this infection in these individuals, who were diagnosed on Tuesday and yesterday.”
Could it be that a new wave of the virus is beginning here?
“No, not yet.
But we naturally need to be very vigilant, and we need to keep that in mind even though there are such certain limits to how much we can take from people.
We don't take samples in asymptomatic people but first that we're getting an infection that seems to be unrecognizable needs us to be given a little more loose hands with it taking samples from people with symptoms," she says.
In this way, the Department of Antibiotics and Virology can be expected to give in to the sampling over the next few days in order to try to better map the situation here domestically.
Does the National Hospital have the capacity to increase sampling domestically and manage screening at the border?
“No, not unlimited, no.
Therefore, there must be some basis for taking samples in individuals who are not in the screening activities; the person must be in quarantine and show symptoms or then have developed symptoms and suspicions of having come to terms with someone who has just arrived in the country or something like that," says Kamilla.
She points out that infection is still ongoing on the infections detected yesterday and that there is now a lot of work to be done in obtaining information about the individuals' journeys.
She says that the origin of the domestic infections appears to be unrecognizable, but does not rule out the possibility that some of those who have now been placed in quarantine may provide evidence that will eventually lead the infection team to the original infection.
The restaurant that doesn’t know much, but thinks it’s one of the best
Not everyone knows where the restaurant Bjargarsteinn is located, and of course it has more fans abroad than in Iceland if the comments about it can be found on TripAdvisor and other sites.
There have been reports of people who have flown to the country to visit him, no wonder.
Berglind Hríðarsdóttir, food blogger and cookbook author, visited Bjargarstein in the days and kept the water of interest
“I don’t know where to start, because the restaurant Bjargarsteinn in Grundarfjörður is a wonderful place.
The history of the house is one of the sweetest that I know, the food up to ten, the view not from the worse end and wonderfully fun servants!" says Berglind.
"Gunni, the owner of the Stone of Stones, cast a spell on each of the precious dishes before us.
The couple and our girls spent an entire evening eating, so it must tell us how good the food was," Berglind adds.
“The house where the restaurant is run is an old apartment building that was moved completely on Grundarfjörður.
The current owners drove their eyes into this house for sale in Akranes, found a beautiful sea plot on Grundarfjörður and made their dream come true.
You can read more about the history of the house on the Bjargarstein website."
“The house and all the surroundings at Bjargarstein are unique.
A collection of family memorabilia has been gathered, and it truly puts its stamp on the home.
On the upper floor there is a lounge and really cozy and homely to enter this wonderful restaurant.
The quality and the cooking is not hidden and it is clear that there is a lot of effort to be put into creating tasty and beautiful restaurants”, says Berglind, and the pictures are not a lie.
Sebastian Vettel joins Red Bull: Says F1 star joins Max Verstappen due to one team member
“No, I’m afraid so, and Sebastian is clear.”
F1 will resume next weekend with two consecutive races on the Silverstone circuit.
Lewis Hamilton can increase his lead after winning two of the first three Grand Prix races since the sport resumed during the coronavirus pandemic.
Vettel will hope for a better performance from the Ferrari, which has been far from its best to date.
Mick Fleetwood praises Peter Green: 'His music will live'
Mick Fleetwood praised Peter Green, co-founder of Fleetwood Mac, who died today at the age of 73.
Green was a founding member of this historic rock band along with former Mick and Jeremy Spencer.
Although Green left the band in 1970, before reaching its peak with albums such as Rumours, Mick has praised this former band member and assured fans that "his music will live on".
"For me and all of the former and current members of Fleetwood Mac, it's losing Peter Green a great moment of memory," Fleetwood said in a statement to PA.
“Peter was the man who co-founded Fleetwood Mac with me, John McVie and Jeremy Spencer.
No one has ever joined Fleetwood Mac without a deep respect for Peter Green and his talents, and the fact that the music should shine brightly and be performed with unwavering passion."
"Peter, I will miss you, but make sure your music will live," the 73-year-old rock star added.
“Thank you for asking me if I wanted to be your drummer for all these years.
We did a great job of playing music that so many of us have enjoyed.
"May God be with you, my dear, with love and respect, Mick Fleetwood."
Green's death was confirmed in a statement from law firm Swan Turton: "Peter Green's family announces with great sadness that Peter died this weekend, peacefully in his sleep.
A further statement will be published in the coming days."
Green leaves behind a daughter, Rosebud Samuels-Greenbaum, whom he had with his ex-wife, Jane Samuels.
Green founded Fleetwood Mac with Mick Fleetwood and Jeremy Spencer, but the band was originally named "Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac featuring Jeremy Spencer".
However, the singer left the band in 1970, after four albums.
Fleetwood Mac would be highly praised and enjoyed worldwide popularity after more were added to the group, including Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks on the albums Rumours and Tusk.
Prince Joakim 's
Joakim Danaprin, the younger son of Queen Margaret Thorhild Danad and the late Prince Henry Danaprin, is still in hospital in Toulouse, France, where he went into surgery the previous day due to a blood clot in his brain.
The Danish state broadcaster DR has stated that it is uncertain how long the prince, who is 51 years old, will be in the hospital, but his condition is stable.
According to the report, the impact of the blood loss on the Prince’s health is now being investigated.
Dr. Peter Qvortrup Geisling, who deals with health issues for DR, has been quoted as saying that the consequences of blood clots in the brain often do not occur until 24 hours after surgery.
“It can be anything from insignificant symptoms to terminal paralysis, memory problems or difficulties with expression,” says Geisling.
He says the prince could wait months for a long rehabilitation.
Prince Joakim Danap, whose full name is Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian and who is also Count of Monpezat, stayed at the family's wine farm, the Chateau de Cayx in southern France when he fell ill on Friday night.
He was first taken to a hospital in the town of Cahors, which is a short distance from the ranch, and then transferred to the University Hospital in Toulouse, where he underwent surgery for a blood clot in his brain.
Google Pixel 4 could make the galaxy
The dual-optional zoom allows the Pixel 4's extra lens to be seen in three dimensions, thus delivering a better mood in the background with a face-to-face setting than in previous Pixel phones, which relied entirely on software to achieve these so-called "bokeh" effects.
To demonstrate the quality of the camera, Google legendary photographer Annie Leibovitz got on stage to discuss her experience with photography with the Pixel 4 over the past 12 months.
Machine learning is still at the forefront in all aspects of new Google smartphones, and in this phone, "computer-controlled photography" is used to improve the HDR+ setting by combining up to nine different images.
New dual lighting controls offer different sliders for brightness and shade and allow users to preview HDR+ in real time.
The phone also relies on machine learning to offer better automatic whitening and an improved "Night Sight" night setting, which is so responsive that it can capture the Milky Way in the night sky.
In addition to other camera lenses, the Pixel 4 Soli introduces a "radiation chipping" on the front of the phone that detects Motion Sense gestures so users can skip track, turn off timer, set a wake up alarm, or turn off the sound of the phone by waving a hand.
All calculations Motion Sense takes place on the device instead of connecting to the internet and the same applies to improved Google helper, as the tech giant is now focusing on shortening response times and improving user privacy.
Google's continued emphasis on making full use of its machine learning capabilities has also resulted in a new voice recording app that encodes live audio without sending data to the internet.
The app is currently only available in English but more languages are expected.
The Pixel 4 will also be the first phone to support Google Stadia, a game platform in the cloud that will launch on November 19 in the United States, but still announce a date for Australia.
In addition to new Pixel phones, Google also introduced a new Pixelbook Go Chromebook computer and a second-generation Google Pixel Buds headset.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart hearing aids, which are expected next year, are completely wireless and have a sound adaption that listens to the environment and constantly adjusts the sound accordingly for maximum clarity.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart headphones are completely wireless and adjust the volume according to the noise around you.
Google also announced an update to its interconnected Wi-Fi home bones in the Nest WiFi line with special bones along with many base stations working together to improve wireless connectivity within the home.
The new Wi-Fi system, which will adopt the Nest name, doubles its predecessor and adds built-in microphones and speakers to use the Google helper in every base station in the home.
It goes on sale in Australia on 5 November and costs $399 for direct and one Wi-Fi point or $549 for two Wi-Fi points.
The Google Home Mini has also been upgraded, but the new $79 Nest Mini improves the sound quality by doubling the bass and has received a built-in wall mount.
All Google smart speakers will have new calling system capabilities for inter-device communication in the home as well as the ability to call the Nest Mini outside the home with the Google Home app.
The final day of the Premier League, Juventus can seal the victory
Here’s a look at football on Sunday:
This is the last day of the season and much is still at stake: participation rights in the Champions League and the European League, the last two bottom seats, and the award-winning Gold Shoe.
Manchester United, Chelsea and Leicester will compete for the last two places in the Champions League, behind champions Liverpool and Manchester City, who are in second place.
One point separates the three teams, and Leicester welcome United.
Wolverhampton and Tottenam are struggling to get a place in the European League.
Aston Villa, Watford and Bournemouth will avoid the two remaining bottom seats next to Norwich, which have already fallen.
With one game remaining, Jamie Vardy of Leicester is the top player with 23 goals, two more than Danny Ings of Southampton and three more than Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang of Arsenal.
The relegation to the Premier League begins with Swansea taking on Brentford in their previous pre-season match.
Fulham play at Cardiff in the other preliminaries starting on Monday.
Leeds and West Bromwich have already emerged from the second tier.
Juventus can beat their own record by recovering to the ninth title in Serie A, with a win over Sampdoria.
As a result, Bianconeri would be seven points behind Inter Milan, who are in second place when two games remain.
On the other hand, Lecce has to work in Bologna to further hope of staying away from falling down a league.
Lecce is four points behind Genoa, who are in 17th place and are one game ahead.
Pole catcher 'sadly throws beer bottle into seal' in Devon
A pole hunter threw a beer bottle into a seal when he interrupted the fishing line, according to charities.
Photos taken at Hope's Nose near Torquay appear to show a man on a rock throwing an object towards an animal.
Duncan Kenny, who took the pictures, said the grey seal was fishing when the polecatcher emptied a bottle and threw it in the back of the animal.
Kenny called this "terrible and reckless behavior".
He said he was picking up trash at this beautiful place in Devon last Sunday morning along with other people in the Seal Protection Society Seal Project when he witnessed the attack.
"The sealer was trying to get to the fishing line," he said.
“The angler stretched the beer, emptied the bottle and threw it into the harness.
"The bottle landed on the back of the seal and he swam away."
Kenni said that "luckily, seals are sturdy animals" but that the seal had simply been doing what was inherent to it.
"By throwing a glass bottle at him, you're stopping him on his hunts," he said.
The Seal Project Society said that this is "not a unique case" and that it had recently received "many reports of this aggressive behavior".
The company's Facebook post states that its volunteers collected 12 bags of trash in the collection at Hope's Nose on Sunday and that "many examples of anti-social behavior" had been seen.
All seals are protected under the Seal Protection Act and people are asked to stay away from them.
Rise of the Christian Pole in Laxá in Dalarna
The first centurion was caught in Laxá in Dalarna the second day.
This was the work of Arnór Asfjörður Guðmundsson.
He had put in a spawning in Christianapolli this morning and it was 89 centimeters.
After noon, he again had the option of Christian puddle, and became aware of a story he had heard about the slowness tending to catch after the spawning.
With this in mind, he took a collie dog and threw over Kristnapoll.
Soon he got a picture, and as he himself tells it.
“After about five seconds, he cleaned himself up completely and I realized it was meth.
I was under a lot of stress because I had 11 pounds.
I usually catch fish, but I’ve had it for 40 minutes.
In fact, he was very comfortable.
I took a few trips up and down the pond but then I managed to beach him and it was a wonderful feeling.
He grabbed the stick from me and jumped on it.
He measured 102 centimetres and I double measured him," said a cheerful hunter in the fishing house Thrandargili in Laxá in Dalarna in conversation with the Scorpions.
As a beginner, there is no such thing as a hundred.
It was his eighth.
He caught such fish in Blanda, Svartá, Hraunsfjördur, Kjarrá, two in Langadalsá and one in Eystri Rangá.
Good fishing is in Laxá in Dalarna, according to Arnór.
The hole that finishes at noon tomorrow has arrived with 35 salmon and our man has eighteen of them.
We are expecting a lot of flooding because of Hannah.
Hanna, the first Atlantic hurricane this year, made landfall in Texas, United States, last night.
Hanna quickly lost power and became a storm, but despite this, heavy rain has occurred in the area and extensive flooding is expected.
Up to 30 centimetres of rain is expected in one day, but in special places it could reach up to 46 centimetres, according to AP news agency.
Special warnings are given for major flash floods that could occur due to the rain.
The area where Hanna reached land has been under attack due to the large distribution of the new coronavirus there.
In addition, the sea has gone ashore and caused damage.
There are now at least 43,700 people without electricity and mass aid stations have been opened in the area.
U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted about the hurricane last night, saying it was important that people listen to experts and follow instructions.
Below you can see footage captured this morning by the AP news agency's cameraman.
Houses burned, shops looted and interior damage
More than sixty are dead and sixty more wounded after an attack in the village of Masteri in the Darfur region of Sudan yesterday.
The attack "was the latest in a series of serious security incidents in recent weeks in which houses were burned, shops and markets looted and infrastructure damaged," according to a statement from the United Nations Office on Human Rights in the capital of Kartúm sent out today.
Abdalla Hamdok, the Prime Minister of Sudan, has issued that security forces will be sent to the region's war-torn region to "protect the population and the harvest".
Only two days ago, unknown troops in the area killed at least 20 civilians, including children, in another attack.
"The escalation of violence in different parts of the Darfur region is leading to increased upheaval, endangering agriculture and threatening the lives and livelihoods of people," the United Nations said.
The conflict in Darfur, in western Sudan, began in 2003 when rebels, most of whom are Arabs, rose up against the governor of Kartum.
Government forces and Arab troops attempting to bring down the insurgency have been accused of widespread atrocities, but about 300,000 were killed in the conflict according to United Nations estimates.
Omas al-Bashir, deposed as the leader of Sudan, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity in Darfur.
Meanwhile, new governments in Sudan are now trying to negotiate peace with major rebel groups.
TV Reporter Appreciates Viewer for Noting Cancer Nodules
TAMPA, Florida (AP) – A Florida television reporter thanks an observant viewer for noticing a nod on her neck and emailing her that she should have him checked.
Victoria Price, a reporter at the WFLA in Tampa, took this advice and was diagnosed with cancer.
Price said on Twitter that she will undergo surgery on Monday to have her tumour, thyroid and some lymph nodes removed.
"The doctor said it was dispersing, but not too much, and we are hopeful that this will be my first and last operation," she said.
The viewer sent Price an email last month saying that the knot reminded her of a knot she had had.
Price, a 28-year-old investigative journalist, said this week that her TV station's slogan was "8 in a team with you".
"But the roles were recently switched when the audience was on a team with ME and I couldn't be more grateful," Price said.
I will forever be grateful to the woman who sent me an email, a complete stranger.
She had no obligation to do so, but she did.
Talk about being on a team.”
Part of Jeronimo Open Space temporarily closed after two attacks by coyotes – CBS Los Angeles
Two were bitten by coyotes near the Oso Creek hiking trail at Jeronimo Road in Mission Viejo on Saturday morning, and the trail had to be temporarily closed.
Laura Wittmer says she sees a coyote almost every morning and usually tries to avoid them just, but on Saturday morning one came straight at her and bit her in the foot.
The walkway has been closed while the attacks are being investigated.
Mission Viejo City published a tweet saying: “Today, two different parties announced that a coyote had bitten a person. Mission Viejo’s animal welfare service is working on the case in collaboration with the department of fish and wildlife, and parts of Jeronimo Open Space have been closed. Take care and be on guard when you want to go.”
Wittmer tried to knock off the prairie wolf with a water bottle.
She called the emergency line to get a ride to her car but was able to drive herself to an emergency room.
The coyote disappeared in the slopes, but public officials hope to be able to drive him and test him for rabies.
Wittmer is being treated for rabies as a precautionary measure for the next two weeks.
She said that this frightening incident would not keep her from the morning races, but that from now on she would choose a different location.
The condition of the other person who was bitten is not clear.
Opponents of racism clash with Seattle police
Conflicts in Seattle on Sunday between police and anti-racism protesters ended with the arrest of a number of people, but public discontent over U.S. President Donald Trump's plans to send a number of federal police officers into major cities.
Protests against racism and police brutality have ignited following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minneapolis in May.
Protesters in Seattle slashed tires of cars and broke windows in trailers during the protest on Saturday, prompting police to declare a riot and empty the streets with pepper spray and flare bombs.
Protesters also set fire to caravans in a building area for future juvenile detention.
Police said they had arrested 45 people, but 21 police officers had been injured.
The protest was held in support of the protests that are ongoing in the neighboring city of Portland, Oregon.
Portland is in the spotlight after Trump ordered the highly controversial radical actions of federal police, in an outburst of local authorities, who say the police officers are using excessive force.
Protest marches have been held in Austin, Texas, as well as Louisville, Kentucky, New York, Omaha and Nebraska, Oakland and Los Angeles, California, and Richmond, Virginia.
In Austin, the capital of Texas, one person was shot dead in an armed conflict downtown on Saturday night, police said.
Concurrent with the protests, Trump is mounting an increasingly difficult fight for re-election in November, and has adopted a tough law enforcement policy.
