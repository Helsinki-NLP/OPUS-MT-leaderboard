Politicians in Wales afraid to "look like fools"
There was dismay among certain members of the Welsh National Assembly over a proposal that their title be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It has arisen due to plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
AMs from across the political spectrum are concerned that the name change could give rise to ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said his group was concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
To readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means silly, and pwp means shit.
A member of the party Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole "was not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there is only a short verbal leap from MWP to Muppet (fool).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently putting together a bill introducing the name changes, said, "The final decision on denominations that members of parliament will get is, of course, up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals, in which there was broad support for calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the title of AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members (WMPs) or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in a public consultation.
AMs seem to be proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach agreement may prove difficult for the Speaker of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to put together a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The bill on the reforms includes other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs get the final vote on what to call them when the bill is debated.
Macedonians vote to change country's name
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote is being held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim on Greece's territory and has long protested Macedonia's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov is opposed to the vote and says he will overturn the vote.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is just a price paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's go silent as the churches in Harlem fight
"The older people I've talked to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," Mr Adams said.
"Today, there is neither."
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
"People are socializing in other ways these days," he said.
"Bars no longer make up the neighborhood's living rooms, where people walk in on a daily basis."
In relation to churches, he worries that the money raised on selling assets won't last long and that "sooner or later they'll be back where they started."
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes that are full of the kind of people who don't help the neighborhood's recurring sanctuaries.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condos in these buildings are white," he says, "and that further inflates the trend, with these churches eventually closing completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the condos will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had operated nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under priest John Howard Johnson, who spearheaded a boycott of stores on 125th Street, one of the primary shopping streets in Harlem, which would not hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to restore the building, they ordered the glockenspiel.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the chime "the bells of the poor".
The expert, who played the glockenspiel in June, called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first glockenspiel in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger glockenspiel in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not find a replacement for him.
What has unfolded in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated tale of architects and entrepreneurs. Some of them caught up by church leaders, others by the diocese.
The parish council – the leading body of the parish, which consists of leading laymen – wrote in July to the diocese about concerns that the diocese "would try to push the expenses further" to the parish council, even though the parish council had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors that the diocese sent in.
Some of the parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old on diving trip after lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dived after lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials say.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then along with a group paddled over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just enthusiasm to have caught a lobster, but then he realized the boy was shouting, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
"His whole collarbone was torn open," said Hammel, as he came up to the boy.
"I shouted for everyone to come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reported in critical condition.
It is unknown which species of shark attacked.
Lifeguard Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the stretch from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons and to conduct investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take over the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's takes up the competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with rows of beauty products with special assistants in the style of department stores.
As part of a major effort to take on the UK beauty market, which has a value of GBP 2.8 billion and continues to grow as fashion and housing products decline. The larger ranges of beauty products are tested in 11 stores around the country and launched in several stores next year if they prove successful.
The investment in beauty products is happening as supermarkets look for new items for shelves that were previously used for televisions, microwave ovens and home appliances.
Sainsbury's says it is doubling its range of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which are being introduced for the first time.
The existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with branded areas similar to those seen in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching the range of Boutique makeup, so the majority of products are suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop is testing stalls in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening in Croydon in south London last week, and the second opening in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a trend towards buying small amounts of food daily at local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury's, has said that the stores are going to look like department stores, as the supermarket chain takes up the fight with discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since they bought both chains two years ago. These initiatives have strengthened their sales of groceries and have made the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempts to update beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 00s, but the collaboration ended with an argument over how the profits from the pharmacies in the supermarkets should be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy chain to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 GBP three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the look and decor of our range of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to give advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs and the engaging environment and convenient locations means we are now a compelling destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'infuriated' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from deal for GBP 11 million
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones left "infuriated", after television host Holly Willoughby withdraws from deal for ?11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time for their residential product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This Morning host, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she is leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones infuriated after she pulls out of their lucrative last-minute lifestyle brand – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "raged" when, during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, the popular TV woman said her new deals – valued at up to 1.5 million GBP – meant she no longer had enough time for their residential product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated net worth of GBP 11 million.
Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she was leaving Truly while Jones flew out of the UK to one of her vacation homes.
One source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project that she would be dealing with for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the headquarters in Marlow, which is already ready for sale."
Experts estimate that the announcement by This Morning’s host, one of the UK’s highest-grossing stars, could cost the company millions of dollars due to large investments in products – ranging from pillows to candles to clothing and homewares – and the potential for further delays in its launch.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby and housekeeper Dan Baldwin has had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, took office as chairman in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to be the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business moves".
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
He made fun of the criticism he would receive from the news media for making a comment that "isn't worthy of a president" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his parody of a news presenter.
“I gave up nothing.”
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump proclaimed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "similar reaction" from the United States in relation to North Korea's initial action against disarmament.
He noted that the United States is instead continuing with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure on.
Trump took a more optimistic view of the speech at his election rally.
“North Korea is doing well,” he said.
“There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his attempts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results – the completion of rocket tests, aid with the release of hostages and the repatriation of earthly remains from U.S. military men.
And he defended his unusual approach in relation to Kim.
"It's so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake ravages island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although over 10 percent of Lombok's population was homeless, no national emergency was declared, which is a prerequisite for calling for international emergency aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has been clear that they are not requesting international assistance, so it's a bit challenging," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Response, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Because of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly subjected to, the country is very poorly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami refuges have been built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight on other coastlines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but apparently a tsunami siren is missing, and this has likely affected the death toll.
Even in the best conditions, it is challenging to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new crash site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's inadequate infrastructure a central point in his campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and train routes.
But Mr Joko's administration has been plagued by a lack of funding as the election campaign next year.
Mr Joko is also experiencing pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge equalises at the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League to Chelsea with a score in the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri some 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, while his team was behind by 1–0.
He poked the ball with his left foot before making a high shot towards the far post.
The ball flew high over the field towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a bouncing Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just about getting in that position, getting the ball. Players like Shaq are always trying to get as far ahead as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante came and I made a single touch. I didn't think much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time, after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea striker returned with the heel to Mateo Kovacic before speeding up midfield and sprinting into Liverpool's half of the pitch.
Kovacic made a quick one-two in midfield.
He then made a long pass that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defence and finished towards the far post with a shot with the left foot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster response early Sunday.
Many people were reported trapped in the rubble of buildings that fell after the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that hit Friday, creating waves up to 6 meters high, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation is underway after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with stab wounds at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street.
Police have called on people in the area who saw or heard something to come forward.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "We are in the early stages of the investigation, but I would urge anyone who stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also encourage anyone, especially taxi drivers who may have recorded something with dashcam, to contact us as they may have information that may be crucial to the investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside an estate.
This afternoon, friends who believe to know the woman have arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and police say they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to enter his apartment, but is told by police that no one is allowed into the building.
He was stunned when he heard what had happened.
Residents are now being told that it will be several hours before they can get back in.
A police officer was overheard saying to one man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman arrives.
She keeps repeating, "It's so terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police cars inside the cordon and another car just outside.
A number of officers stood within the cordon and monitored the apartment complex.
Anyone with information please write a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and state log 247 on September 30th.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell becomes the latest memorial hit by discussion of "rewriting history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatical, Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the context of the current debate over the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace at Westminster would become a target.
The storm during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's stunning depiction of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century attitudes and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worth paying tribute to.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against outside pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate depiction is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is absolutely certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure representing one side of the struggle.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of tribute and remembrance."
Killer berry attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China according to local media reports.
The man, identified only under his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a torn artery and smeared with blood near a pig path at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The following morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pigsty next door was open.
He said there was a big boar in the pigsty with blood in its mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 250-kg pig had bitten the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and injured," said the cousin, who goes by the surname "Wu", in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Footage from security cameras showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market leader told the Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while police collect evidence at the crime scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and authorities from the market are negotiating compensation for his death.
It is rare, but there have been cases of pigs attacking people in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 295 kg had to be driven by a Welsh farmer towards his tractor, until his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
"They're just playful.
They’re very curious... they’re not trying to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to produce heavy rain in much of the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it moves over the cooler waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will provide heavy rains with flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 38 m/s, a Category 1 hurricane, at 10 a.m. Sunday (Danish time) and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will provide up to 254 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture will interact with the low-pressure outlet coming closer, creating heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storm surges, liquid fallout and possibly landslides in the desert.
The tropical moisture will create rain with up to 51 to 76 mm of rain per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially over much of Arizona.
There is a high probability of storm surges with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move into the desert on foot when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can transform canyons into roaring rivers and thunder will create powerful local winds and create dusty winds.
The approaching low-pressure outlet will provide heavy rain along the coast in parts of Southern California.
There is a risk of a total precipitation of more than 13 mm, which can result in smaller amounts of liquid fallout and slippery roads.
This would be the region's first rainfall in their rainy season.
Scattered tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the area of Four Corners on Tuesday and continue Wednesday.
In October, there may be major temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic gets cooler, but the tropics remain reasonably warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences through the central United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start in October, with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeastern areas.
It can get up to 26 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long climate outlook indicates that there is a high probability of temperatures above average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 Million Watched the Hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million people watched Thursday’s poignant testimony by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
At the same time, the political battle continued with stations interrupting the regular programs to tell of Friday's late development: an agreement put together by Senator from Arizona Jeff Flake, which allowed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh in a drunken state was grating on her and trying to take her clothes off for a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he is 100 percent certain that it did not happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million people saw it on Friday.
The company tallied average ratings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediately available ratings from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring how many people watch programs in offices.
To put that in perspective, it’s a ratings equivalent to a game during the NFL playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-bearing hosts have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing that lasted throughout the day, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught for open CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, as protesters yelled at him as he tried to take an elevator to the hearing in the judicial committee.
He stood looking down for several minutes as he was being scolded, and CNN broadcast live.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at the hearing within the committee.
All of the television stations covered live a few hours later when the Judiciary Committee was due to vote on whether or not Kavanaugh's nomination should proceed to a vote for the entire Senate.
However, Flake said he would only vote for under the belief that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee in the following week, which the Democrats, who are outnumbered in the Senate, had requested.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with the Coons and a number of senators subsequently, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election had an impact because it was clear that Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK prime minister accuses critics of 'playing politics' with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside that with Theresa May on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson made her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other's tariffs was "entirely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson suspected of being behind LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and imprisoned on suspicion of manslaughter, Baton Rouge police said.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on, CBS subsidiary WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had confessed to the shooting at Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The coroner of East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death was a wound from a gun shot that went from head to neck.
The police department says that a task force from the Louisiana State Police, the state police laboratory, police from Southern University and citizens of the area have assisted with the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director at LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked police in the area for their "care and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach at LSU, Will Wade, said the team is "broken" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
"That's the kind of thing you're always afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano spews ashes over Mexico City
Ash, spewed from the volcano Popocatepetl, has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater occurred and 183 gas and ash spills were recorded over the course of 24 hours.
The center monitored the rumblings and tremors over several laps.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windows in neighborhoods in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters seeking independence clashed with riot police as several thousand took part in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists held riot police back, threw with and powder paint, and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
Fighting also occurred later in the day when police used their staffs to keep the fighting down.
For several hours, independence groups shouted "Nothing forgotten, nothing forgiven", and were met with unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain".
14 people received treatment for minor injuries that occurred during the protests, the local press reported.
The mood remains high in the independence-minded region one year after the October 1 vote, which was declared illegal from Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, but voter turnout was low, and those opposed to the secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote during violent clashes at polling stations across the region.
Independence groups had camped the night of Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer dares to hope that Catalonia can achieve independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy at having been given the opportunity to vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Although they gained a narrow but important victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum, and many of their best-known leaders have either themselves moved into exile or are in detention awaiting judgment for their role in holding the vote and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the protests on her phone in support of the police, saying the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"There's going to be more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have awaited his trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"The nomination as a candidate in the European elections is the best approach to disassociate ourselves from the setback in democratic values and the subjugation we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house hit by car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car bumped into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7.30pm BST.
Police Superintendent Bob Blemmings said damage occurred to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Shooting from Menga gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
Promoters Livingston overtook Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his only second defeat after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot made the difference when Gary Holt's team moved up side by side with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team has not won away in the league this season and will face the leading team Hearts, which they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
The Rangers will face Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, in turn, expands their undefeated streak to six games, and head coach Holt has still not suffered a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against cash away
Holt's team should have been ahead a long time before they scored, and their direct playing style created major problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but handed across in front of the goal, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the goal after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's transverse header in front of the goal.
The home team were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could give the away team problems in dead-ball situations.
And it was under those conditions that the important goal came.
The Rangers committed a free kick, and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created the lay-up for Menga, who made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
At the time, Rangers had dominated ball possession, but struggled to get through the home team's defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was virtually unchallenged.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was deflected with the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame during another of Livingston's deadball situations.
There were ongoing passes into Livingston's field, but were averted, and two demands for a penalty kick – after Halkett's tackle on the substitute Glenn Middleton and one by hand on the ball – were rejected.
"Phenomenal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal effort and strong result for Livingston.
All played fantastically and exceeded expectations on their upward journey.
Their playing style and squad are largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but much of the credit must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he stepped in.
There were a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and led a well-organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the game.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They have at times been really good under Gerrard, but they played below level.
Their finishes lacked sharpness – only once did they get the home team exposed – and that’s an abrupt wake-up call for Rangers, who are in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
Disagreements have arisen over areas such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's moves towards the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police held a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but plenty of supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – also took notice, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to take over the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as a hero by some German Turks and mocked as an autocrat by others.
Accident on the road in Deptford: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist has died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred close to the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwest of the city at about 10:15 a.m. BST.
The driver of the car stopped and there were rescuers at the scene, but the man died at the scene.
The accident occurs a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car whose driver fled the scene, on Childers Street, about one mile from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said police officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roadblocks have been set up, bus routes have been rerouted, and motorists are encouraged to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured during unrest
Six prison officers are injured during unrest in a high-security prison, according to the Prison Office.
There was unrest in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9.30 a.m. BST Sunday, and the unrest is still ongoing.
Specialized "Tornado" officers are brought in to deal with the riots, which involve eight inmates and take place in one wing of the prison.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said, "Specially trained prison staff are deployed to deal with the ongoing unrest in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and are clear that those responsible are reported to the police and may end up spending longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the warden was treated in hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, riot police were called to the prison to deal with serious riots in which employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm surge (dry areas may benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it is most likely to occur early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert landscape of the southwestern United States, creating a risk of storm surges.
The National Weather Service has already issued storm flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route across Phoenix Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones had retained tropical storm or low pressure status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64 km) of the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm of rain with isolated amounts up to 152 mm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin will likely get 25 to 51 mm with the option of 102 mm locally.
For those outside the risk of storm surge, Rosa's rain can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will be beneficial because the southwestern United States is currently experiencing drought.
According to U.S. drought monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought, the second-highest category," reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is expected to hit land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning with maximum wind speed of 38 m/s and is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north at 19 km/h.
The storm meets cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore drops in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with tropical currents on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rains over parts of Mexico can become heavy and pose a high risk of flooding.
"A total of 76 to 152 mm of precipitation is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora with the possibility of up to 254 mm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early morning Tuesday as tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The primary expected danger from Rosa or the remains of it is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the Southwest Desert area of the United States," the National Hurricane Center reported.
The rain is expected to create life-threatening storm surges and liquid fallout in deserts as well as landslides in mountain terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man are arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m. BST Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Somerset said.
Officers have urged anyone who may have mobile recordings of the incidents to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh succumbed to Democratic Party "evil and anger"
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the reckless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a voter turnout meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been subjected to the "evil, anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress Thursday, strongly denying and emotive accusations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his charges.
The president said Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote for confirmation by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that affirms one of the brightest legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an amazing past in public service," he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of Republicans attending the polls in the midterm elections.
"In five weeks, one of the most important choices of our lifetime will be.
You can't vote for me, but you actually vote for me," he said.
"That's why I travel around and fight for amazing candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are out on a mission to "struggle and block."
The first important Senate procedural vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday, a person high in the Republican Party has told CNN.
Several hundred killed by Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, death toll grows
At least 384 were killed and many of them washed away by huge waves that hit the beach when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Several hundred people gathered for a festival on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves hit the coast at dusk, sucking many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still engaged in activities on the beach. They did not immediately run and became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster preparedness BNPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"Tsunami didn't come alone, it towed cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Several managed to survive by climbing trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
Around 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Disaster Preparedness has published aerial photographs showing many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to rock the coastal town on Saturday.
The number of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's National Board for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released during Friday's major earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and this may have made the tsunami larger, the agency said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found clamped under the rubble from collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been injured and that 29 are reported missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater along the 300 km coastline north of Palu, the area of Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
Communication "was completely paralyzed without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"Over 300,000 people live here," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," they said.
The agency was criticized from many fronts on Saturday for not disclosing that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said the waves had come within the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, one can hear a man on the top floor of a building desperately shouting warnings about the Tsuami coming closer to people on the street below.
Within minutes a wall of water hits the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the footage immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but food and basic necessities are still badly needed among the evacuees.
The city's airport has been reopened, but only for relief work, and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have arrived safely in Palu city, where employees seek shelter under tarpaulins set up in the courtyard by their account. They came past areas of extensive destruction on the road, Doseba said.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even as relief organizations began the tough work of putting relief back on track, there were complaints that foreign relief workers with extensive expertise were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, financial aid, supplies and employees from abroad can only enter if the area in which the accident occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'OK, it's a national disaster', we can open for international assistance, but there is no status yet."
On the second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing people held on in the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that lighten the grim tales of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other of those caught at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Monday, were among his students.
"As a veteran of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon told how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who were attending the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, resulted in only one grey flybone instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered," he says.
Twenty take 26,750 USD while refilling ATM in Newport on the Levee
Twenty people on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was about to meet an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from Newport police.
The driver of the car had emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "ran behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that should have been delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on the identity of the thieves, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
He announced the change Saturday on Twitter, writing, "The creature formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, which was cancelled for "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
The name is an abbreviation of his current stage name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most frequently used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier in the year, discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has switched between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he reported that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former collaborators, JAY-Z, has also switched between lowercase and uppercase and changed whether the hyphen is included.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico’s newly-elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country nears the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliatory action against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never ever use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
Troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 at a time when leftist student movements took root in many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly government grants to students and opening more free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Artificial Intelligence Funding
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have issued statements about artificial intelligence. However, the U.S. still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced their plan last year and aims to take first place in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we're looking for the next big breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
Doubling the budget could double the chances of the next big achievement in artificial intelligence being achieved in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later became head of Microsoft Research and director of Google's department in China.
Lee acknowledged previous technology contests supported by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge held by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when there will be a new contest so that the next visionaries can be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain scholarships from the government, Lee says.
"It's not China that grabs the academic leaders, it's the big companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhDs in artificial intelligence should automatically be offered work permits.
China's Council of State issued their Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions in a manner similar to that of the National Science Foundation and other state organizations distributing money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence, which will involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the foundation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF is currently investing over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
However, U.S. legislation trying to set up a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has stood still for several months.
Macedonians vote to change country's name
The Macedonian people voted Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's attempts to gain membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province named Macedonia and maintains that the name of their northern neighbour constitutes a claim on Greek territory, and has therefore used their veto power when Macedonia has applied to join NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's primarily Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the vote, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the voter turnout will make up the 50% required for the vote to become valid.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price worth paying to create access to associations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgiyevska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will abide by the result of the vote and assert it.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said that at 1 p.m. no irregularities had been reported.
But turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent at the most recent general election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko took part in the vote in Macedonia on a change of the country's name, which would open up for membership of NATO and the EU, in Strumica in Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and pulled chairs up in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the vote.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we will achieve membership with raised forehead, not by the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn against others like China and Russia and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership would provide a much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I think a large majority will vote in favour because over 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that a "yes" result would be a "secure our future".
A poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the vote – fewer than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian television channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
For the vote to be valid, the turnout must be at least 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the pro-Western government since it took office last May.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero fights his way through the entire Brighton defence and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his scoring coming after 65 minutes.
The Argentine striker received a pass on the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly ran past three Brighton defenders before swooping out onto the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He fought his way past one defender, and subsequently ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a pass to the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to outwit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the immediate lead in the Premier League game.
That goal came after 29 minutes.
In that sequence, Aguero received the ball deep inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before leading Sterling towards the far post.
The Sky Blues forward poked the ball into the net just before it slipped past the goal.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12.55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to tease the Rockies
The Nationals are eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn't have much to fight for.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to take the throw-off Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still an opportunity to participate in the playoffs for the Rockies, which have played one game more than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies at least held on to a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still have their first division title at hand.
"Although we have nothing to play for, we can go to the game knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the crowd here in Denver and that the opponents would play at the probably highest level I'm going to face this year.
Why shouldn't I be excited to play in those conditions?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the starting lineup for Sunday, but will likely put Scherzer in as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the spot for the 34th time, trained his throws Tuesday and would pitch on Sunday, which is usually his day of rest.
The right-hander from Washington is at 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump to hold voter turnout in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of Republicans attending the polls in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lifetime.
It’s one of the big, big ones – you can’t vote for me, but you actually vote for me. That’s why I travel around and fight for amazing candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see, it's happening right now.
And they're determined to get their power back by any means possible, and you can see how vicious, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they run over to get power and control. That's what they want, power and control, but we won't give them that."
The Democrats, he said, have a mission "to fight and block."
"And you've seen it over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and vicious and disgusting and lying."
He mentioned the top Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee Dianne Feinstein by name, which triggered loud booh from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, wait a minute – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer an inclusive party.
They are intolerant of those who express their opinions
When Momentum’s activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn’t really a surprise.
I am just the latest in a long line of Labour MPs who have been told that we are not welcome – simply because we have expressed our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship measure was to criticize me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of a responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically similar problems to which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Member of Parliament, the Friday evening sittings have been exactly like that.
Today, unfortunately, the tone of many meetings is not like that, and the promise of "friendlier, gentler" politics lies far back in the past if it ever got started.
It has become increasingly clear that dissenting views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are weighed according to whether the party leadership can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I previously thought I shared a political point of view began to expect me to make a U-turn and adopt positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with – whether it was about national security or the EU’s single market.
When I say my opinion in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – a long string of abusive messages follow on social media, calling for the desegregation and contradiction of the middle-of-the-road policy and telling me that I shouldn’t be a Labour member.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments made to me are usually political.
I have a deep respect for the professionalism and fighting spirit of those colleagues who, every day, are showered with sexism or racism, yet continue to struggle.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should create a tolerant culture.
But in reality it is no longer a inclusive organization and with every vote of no confidence or change the selection rules of the party become narrower.
I’ve been given plenty of advice over the last two years that if I put a lid on myself and am not so loud, then I’ll “enough”.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since joining Labour 32 years ago, when I was in school, I was provoked by the Thatcher government's neglect that had left our classroom in a dilapidated state, and I set out to create better public services for those who need it most – whether as a councillor or minister in the government.
I never hid my politics, even during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the resolution on Friday, I would say that when the country is tipping over towards Brexit, which will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the one message I have is not to the Nottingham Momentum, but to the local electorate, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of abstention or political aptitude will deter me from acting on what I believe is your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr becomes top team
Two late scores may have caused the final result to draw a not entirely truthful picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this fantastically entertaining match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard and are the only undefeated team of ten.
In the end, it was just as much their superior defense as their better use of chance, which carried the home team home, and coach Peter Murchie had absolutely the right to be satisfied.
"Our matches have been demanding so far and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Respect Ayr, they took advantage of their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's score after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish national player Rory Hughes, awarded to the match by the Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a score which was not followed up by a kick.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty kick just before halftime. He scored and then got a solo score, so there was 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
However, Melrose began well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's scoring, followed by a kick from Baggot, reduced the point difference to five.
There was then a long interruption because Ruaridh Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was carried off the field on stretcher. When the game was resumed, Ayr extended the lead with a score from Stafford McDowall and a follow-up kick from Climo.
Acting Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and again Melrose took advantage of their extra man with a score from Bruce Colvine without follow-up kicks after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson could after a line-out score behind the advancing Ayr cluster.
Climo followed up with a kick within the posts and followed up with one more almost immediately after the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's box kick and sent winger Gregor Henry off for the home field's fifth score.
Still Game star looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be taking the step to the restaurant business after it emerged that he has taken the directorship of an authorized restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main character of along with his collaborator Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series' last, and it seems Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but one source suggested to the Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
'The sea is ours': Indian state Bolivia hopes court will reopen route to Pacific
Sailors patrol around the naval headquarters, shrouded in rains, in La Paz.
In public buildings there is a blue flag.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are overpainted with the motto: "The sea is ours, it's a right.
It's a duty to take it back."
Throughout the inland state of Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is still strong, as is the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
Hopes are perhaps at their highest for several decades, while Bolivia awaits a verdict from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of voting.
"Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and naturally waits with a positive eye on the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on big screens throughout the country and hope that the court in The Hague will agree with Bolivia that Chile – after decades of discussions – is committed to negotiating to give Bolivia sovereignty over an area with access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial election campaign next year, also has a lot at stake at his sentencing on Monday.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will side with Bolivia – and that there would be no major changes if it did.
The United Nations Assembly, which is based in the Netherlands, does not have the power to take over Chilean territory and has stipulated that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
That the International Court of Justice renders judgment just six months after the closing arguments were heard indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of advancing Bolivia's cause, the past four years may have given way to setbacks.
"The matter of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales' bellicose rhetoric has done away with the remaining Chilean benevolence, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was abnormally quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end an era of 139 years of disagreements and achieve benefits for both parties", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up access rights to the Pacific," he added.
"The sentencing is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can rely on the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm their nuclear weapons if they cannot first trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to abide by promises made during a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments were made following the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo apparently facing a restart of the stalemate of nuclear diplomacy over three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "wishful dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to make a declaration as long as Pyongyang has not first taken significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about eliminating an arsenal that the country most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month in preparation for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large headgear, which you will soon be able to buy in local stores
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed on the catwalk a collection of remarkable extra-large headwear as part of their SS19 collection. The collection impressed at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have dominated on Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
The most impressive work by Valentino was a sumptuous one with a feather-like broad shadow covering the models' heads.
There were also other extra-large accessories, including watermelons with jewels and even a pineapple – but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had stitched lips that were more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like a diving thing with a snorkel and a mask, and others looked like a melted waffle ice cream.
And if you continue the great fashion statements, you're in luck.
Style scouts predict that the huge hats could come to stores near you.
The giant hats arrive on the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60 centimetre wide shadow that is seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, which is behind the highly impractical hat that was spread across social media, has sent a new big creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straws that is almost as big as the model that showcases it.
The orange bast ash with bast fringes and a white leather handle was the most eye-catching in Jacquemus’ La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in mainstream stores next summer. The designer has had such a big impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for huge-size accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have many great academic achievements behind them, and it has continued in 2018 with yet another series of outstanding exam results, further enhanced by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other endeavors in the local community.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their students and parents.
The independent schools try to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can put together and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we find that modern languages remain a popular topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it hits his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it hits his heart."
It’s an important reminder that we can’t just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can see from the most recent exam results this year that languages rank highest in the statistics with the most passed exams in the independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received the high grade of A.
The data collected by SCIS' 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students received grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important competences that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now perceived as the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools’ pensa and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that among the reasons employers could not fill vacancies, 17% had a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
More job opportunities will require language skills in the future, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career the young people choose, if they have learned another language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically give a multilingual person a head start to the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of over 4,000 respondents in the UK in 2013, 75 per cent could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 per cent.
Therefore, it is important to invest in language teaching for those who are children today.
When you can speak more languages, especially languages from developing countries, it gives children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, schools differ in which languages are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most important to the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose from at independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills required to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be truly important for the country's future in a global business environment, and this must be reflected in the degree programmes.
Modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this distinction to the youth of Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron to debut for Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is unclear how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James most likely won't play the entire game.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans in relation to the Lakers' scheduled six pre-season games.
"Where I am in my career, I don't need matches before the start of the season to get ready," he said.
Trump Voter Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of voter turnouts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s Trump’s first of five scheduled voter turnouts next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm Trump’s nominee for the vacant seat on the Supreme Court is on hold, Trump is trying to garner support for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans face the risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
When is Trump's voter turnout in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump’s election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place at midnight on the night of Saturday, November 29 and Sunday, November 30, 2018.
You can watch Trump's voter turnout in West Virginia online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely talk about this week's hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court. The hearings were tense due to allegations of sexually offensive behavior, and the expected Senate vote on confirmation has been put on hold for a week while the FBI investigates the allegations.
But the primary goal of this streak of voter turnouts is to create momentum for the Republicans who are facing a difficult election in November.
People from President Trump's campaign team said the five voter turnouts next week are aimed at "creating energy among volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the busy campaign time," a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who would not be quoted by name, told Reuters.
Tonight's voter turnout is held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to troop up to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, who deals with political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown fighting spirit and is trying to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday’s singles duels
After three one-sided laps, Saturday's four-man duels were perhaps what the Ryder Cup needed.
The fluctuating momentum pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but a concept that the players believe in – not least in competitions like this.
Where would they say there's momentum now?
"They led by six points, and now it's four, so we're probably looking at that a bit like momentum," Jordan Spieth said before he held off.
Of course, Europe has the advantage. They are 4 points ahead, and there are 12 points more to play for.
As Spieth says, however, the Americans feel that they have little wind in their sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both can boast three points out of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The loud cheers grew louder as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important put, which secured victory in duel four, although he and Thomas had been two strokes behind after two duels.
His put that secured them the fight on hole 15 was met with a similar scream – the kind of scream that shows that he does not believe the American team is out of the competition yet.
"You just have to find the inner strength and focus on your own struggle," Spieth said.
That’s all the players have left.
18 ways to make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, arguably the biggest story from the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but sympathetic pair have scored four points in four matches, and appear flawless.
"Moliwood" were the only couple who did not get a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way the energy seems to flow both to and from the wild crowd shows that they are the ones that will be hardest to beat on Sunday. And it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory were to be pinned down by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Preferably synchronously on each their hole.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short process against Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the four-man duels when he formed a pair with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and Swede into a hole they were never close to getting out of.
No one will be able to get you out of your hole on Sunday.
The games with four balls and two teams of two players are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way the strategy can change quickly.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a significant lead before the final day, but the four-man duels have also shown that Team USA has the fighting spirit that some, especially in the US, have doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 ahead of final day of Ryder Cup
Europe has a big advantage before the final day of the Ryder Cup, after they came out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a lead over the United States of 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two wins over a troubled Tiger Woods and have so far scored four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, trying to win the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated over an inaccurate American team in this morning's fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. provided more resistance in the foursomes. They won four games, but were still behind.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12 singles matches if they are to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to have won four points in a row, and he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood", are after a sensational weekend the second pair in Ryder Cup history to have won four points in their first four matches.
They crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then elegantly defeated a discouraged Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who struggled through the first two games on Saturday, had small brilliant glimpses, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well rested for this morning's fourballs and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes and got a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – who is number three in the world.
Europe, however, has it exactly the way they want it, on an easy windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time major-winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They got a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later returned and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes, having lost the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in Ryder Cup history that a team has struggled back after being behind by four points before the singles matches. However, as the Furyks currently have the trophy, they only have to achieve a draw to keep it.
After being second best for two days, however, it seems they can't master a counterattack Sunday.
North Korea says it will not disarm unilaterally if there is no confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions reinforce their mistrust of the United States and that the country will not give up their nuclear weapons unilaterally in such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the worldwide organization's general assembly that North Korea had shown "substantial goodwill" within the past year, e.g., by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling an area for nuclear tests and promising not to further develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We have not seen a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security and under such conditions, there is no chance that we ourselves will take the first step and disarm unilaterally."
While Ri reiterated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phased" approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps. But his speech seemed important as it did not unequivocally reject unilateral disarmament, as has been the case in the past from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim promised to work "nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the Korean War that took place in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown resistance in terms of softening up tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament first' and expands the pressure of sanctions to achieve their purpose by force, even opposing the 'declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a pipe dream among people who don't know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions reinforce our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for another summit between Kim and Trump, as the US leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in within the past five months, adding, "If nuclear disarmament were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so stale."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year, where he told the UN General Assembly that firing North Korea's missiles at the U.S. mainland was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened at the United Nations with the "total destruction" of North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for showing courage in terms of disarmament, but said there is still much to be done and that the sanctions need to remain until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a schedule for these actions, but said "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council must maintain sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve total, final, confirmed nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased economic sanctions against North Korea in an effort to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons program.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and subsequently said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, while North Korea just hours later accused him of making "gangsterish demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile facility as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "similar steps."
He said Kim had told him that the "similar steps" he demanded were the security promises Trump made in Singapore, as well as moves toward a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take Course on Getting Enough Sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all undergraduate students more sleep. The purpose of the course is to counteract the growing macho culture, where you study all night held up by large amounts of caffeine.
A researcher has shown that the students at the world’s best university often do not know the first thing about taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has created the course, which, he believes, is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the course after giving a presentation on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"When the presentation was finished, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why do I only get to know this now that I'm on the candidate?'
"She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is offered for the first time this year, explains how good sleeping habits can improve one’s academic and sporting performance as well as one’s overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health field, says the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that students were in severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course consists of, among other things, various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises, there is a picture of a dorm room where students should click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to gain knowledge about the effects of caffeine and light, and how one's sporting performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and how important good sleeping habits are.
In another part of the course, participants hear about how lack of sleep over a long period of time increases the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on various icons on an interactive map of the campus.
"We know it won't change the behavior of students right away.
But we think they have a right to know – just like you have a right to know how cigarettes affect health,” adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride that is in taking an "allnighter" still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students have led to sleep deprivation being a growing problem.
The “secret weapon” against stress, exhaustion and anxiety is good and adequate sleep, he said – it even discourages weight gain because sleep deprivation makes the brain think you’re starving, which is why they’re constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler organize the course last year when he took one of his first-year courses at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and made him work at making it a general course throughout the university.
He hopes that the next thing will be that all graduates are offered a similar course before continuing their education.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm so that they know when to go to bed and when to get up. This can create awareness of the harmful effects of the light from electronic screens, which can speed up the circadian rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Goal from Menga lowers Gerrard and co.
Rangers suffered another away defeat as Dolly Menga's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's incoherent team had to settle for a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The team from Ibrox were looking for their first away win since the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard only the second defeat in 18 matches as coach. Thus, there are eight points up to Hearts in first place of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangers team could not respond to.
The Rangers now go down to sixth place, while Livingston climbs to third after Hibernian with only the goal score in difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to Rangers, as line referee Calum Spence had to be dealt with after being hit in the head by a thrown object which appeared to be coming from the away section.
Gerrard made eight changes to the lineup that reached the Betfed Cup semi-final by toning past Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, ran with the same 11, who shaved a point off Hearts' lead last week, and he would have delighted to see his sharp team exhausting opponents all over the pitch.
Rangers had the ball the most, but Livingston was more efficient.
They should have scored two minutes into the game when Menga's first-time pass sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder's attempts missed.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs found its way to captain Craig Halkett, but his defender Alan Lithgow kicked past the rear post.
However, the Rangers took control, but played more on hope than ability in the attack game.
Alfredo Morales was certainly not satisfied when referee Steven Thomson overruled the Colombian's appeals for a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless clashed after a quarter of a game.
Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Rangers goaltender Liam Kelly did not have problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
Although Livi's opening in the 34th minute was somewhat coincidental, it must be said to be deserved for their efforts alone.
Again, Rangers could not handle a deadball situation in depth from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took the time to find Menga, who could easily kick it into goal.
During the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which almost immediately gave paw when the winger sent the ball in to Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the away team to play on their terms with many long balls up the field from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have extended the lead in the final part of the match, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with a sure hand before Lithgow headed alongside goal.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton once again appealed for a late penalty kick after colliding with Jacobs, but referee Thomson also looked the other way here.
Yearbook: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from the yearbook "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today – if we COUNT... – was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that would eventually lead to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has become a staple of both science and popular culture, as could be seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred as peasant scientists:
Man: "What on earth is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals makes."
Evans: "Oh, come on, it's going on!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have turned 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine may teach immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells
New cancer vaccine may teach immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then “see” the protein that is common to many cancers and where they are injected again.
A test vaccine performs promisingly in patients with a variety of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from patients and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein named HER2, which many cancers have, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “makes several cancers develop,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and bowel cancers, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, taking immune cells out of patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL performance.
It didn't go well.
After an incoherent appearance in the Saturday Night Live studio, Kanye West was booed when he paid tribute to US President Donald Trump, saying that he himself would run for president in 2020.
After playing the third song of the evening, Ghost Town wearing a Make America Great Again cap, he began a thunderous speech against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
“I talk so often to white people who say, ‘Why do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
But if I were concerned about racism, I would have long since moved from the United States," he said.
SNL started tonight's show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's assault charges.
Although the footage was not shown, comedian Chris Rock uploaded West's tirade on social media.
It is uncertain whether Rock attempted to exhibit West by posting the footage.
West also complained to the audience about poor treatment backstage because of his headgear.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, ‘Don’t go out there with that hat on.’
They bullied me!
And they said I had sunk deep," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how deep I've sunk?", saying that he would put on his Superman cape because it means that "You can't decide what to do. Do you want progress in the world?
Try it with love.”
The audience booed at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff appeared to be embarrassed, Variety said with a comment from a person present: "There was a toll in the study."
West had been booked as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose then-girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many by performing the song I Love It while dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received the backing of the leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: THANKS FOR NOT LETING YOU COULD BY THE POPULATION."
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West just "is who he is and that's just fine."
"But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his 'art') who embraces and pours out an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And so have we,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper had announced that he has taken the name change to "the entity officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and thus follows Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder after stabbing at restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed with a knife in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police say.
The defendant is expected to stand trial in Belfast on Monday.
The charges are reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has revealed he is looking for toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for swinging swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor goes after the stereotypical macho hero and says that such TV characters mean that young men often feel they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes something has "went wrong" and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem lies with him "very much on his mind".
"At the moment it is very much on my mind – where have we gone wrong in the city with masculinity?", he said.
"If we look at the current problems, what have we taught young men in their upbringing?"
Kit believes that television may be partially responsible for the increase of toxic masculinity due to the highly masculine characters.
He continued, "What is innate and what is learned?
What is it that young men learn from television and from the streets that makes them feel like they have to be men in this way?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time – how do we change that?
It is obvious that something has gone wrong for the young men."
During the interview, he also admitted that he will not be making sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
Kit appears from November in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film director and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best thing about the entire Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so in that way it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, whom Kit's character, Jon Snow, falls in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie's family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has posted a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of the new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities told a conference in Yunnan province.
In one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalized, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men sooner or later marry women because of the country’s conservative values.
Many cases of infection are due to the lack of use of contraception in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaked data on Republican senators and thunders against "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
House of Representatives member Maxine Waters denied Saturday the allegations that a member of her staff has shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claims originated from websites and supporters of the "far right."
"Lies, lies and more terrible lies," Waters wrote in a Twitter post.
The published information allegedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill, during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support sites such as Gateway Pundit of RedState announced that the IP addresses indicated that the information had been posted by Waters' people, after which they published information about a member of Waters' staff, writes The Hill.
"This unsubstantiated allegation is completely untrue and a direct lie," Waters continued.
The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie."
Waters' statement quickly received criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"It's an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
"That suggests she doesn't have the right temperament to be a congressman.
If you’re accused of something you haven’t done, don’t get angry.
You can't be defiant.
The motives of the prosecutor must not be questioned.
You have to stay calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, who was criticized for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate aiming to take over Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also made his point on Twitter.
"Great, if that's true," he tweeted.
In Waters' official statement, she says her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and law enforcement regarding these fraudulent allegations."
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are found," she continued. "And that they will be held legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to anyone and everyone on my staff."
Johnny English is back – an underwhelming spy comedy starring Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all recent films with a British twist, and it also seems relevant to the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will dry, sarcastic self-satire, about how bad things are with us, become the country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and big eyes got his permission to make roars renewed again. His name signals more than anything that he is a comical invention aimed at places where the cinema visitors do not speak English.
He is, of course, the dumb secret agent who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a bit of Clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean and proper blob of him who performed a single note to the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He is also originally based on the worldwide and international prank that left chaos in his wake after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television commercials.
There are a few good moments in this latest shot at the strain from JE.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the propellers sounded against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comedy, but the humor feels rather underwhelming and strangely superfluous, especially now that more "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer compelling comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's crazy adventures aren't as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film follies in the role of Mr. Bean.
The point of the film is that the UK is in serious trouble.
An internet hacker has infiltrated England's top secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the English agents in the field to the dismay of the agent in charge - a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last chance for a pompous and battle-ready prime minister, who is already suffering a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this Teresa May-like character, but there isn't much to work on in the script.
When her security advisers inform her that every active spy has been exposed, she is forced to cancel someone’s pension.
And of course it's the clumsy Johnny English, who is now a superintendent at an upper-class school, but secretly teaching how to become a secret agent. There are some funny sequences here when English stands for some kind of School of Rock education in espionage.
English is rushed back to an emergency meeting at Whitehall and reunites with his hard-fought former right-hander Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now married an overenthusiastic but well-meaning submarine captain – a role that Vicki Pepperdine spills on.
Batman and Robin are back when they meet Olga Kurylenko’s beautiful femme fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister stumbles close to being flattered by the charismatic and eerie tech billionaire Jason Volta – played by Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England’s computer problems.
English and Bough start their furiously risky escapades: disguised as servants, they set fire to a distinguished French restaurant; they wreak havoc as they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English creates sheer Ragnarok as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with Volta's house.
All the guns are fired in the film's closing sequence, but as well-meaning and energetic as it is, there is a sense of children's television about it.
Pretty mediocre.
And as I couldn’t help but think with the other Johnny English films: Can’t the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
Labour rejects four-day working week plan with unchanged pay for UK workers
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour is said to be considering a radical plan so that the English can settle for a four-day work week but get paid for five.
The party allegedly wants business leaders to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give employees an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would have three days of weekend without going down in salary.
Sources state that the idea would be consistent with the party's economic goal of pulling the country in a more favorable direction for the workers.
Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day work week as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party told The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published by the end of the year."
"It's not going to happen in a day, but a four-day work week is a goal that fits with the party's approach to changing the economy for the benefit of workers and to the party's overall strategy for industry."
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, the goal is not unanimously supported by the Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said, "A four-day work week is not the party's policy and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour shadow finance minister John McDonnell used last week's party meeting to record his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell says he is determined to tear back power from "anonymous CEOs" and "utilizers" in utilities.
The shadow finance minister's plans also cast doubt on whether current shareholders in water utilities will get their money back, as a government led by Labour could "set it off" on the basis of immoral actions.
He also confirmed plans to get workers on company boards and to set up including owner funds, which will distribute 10 percent of private companies' share value to employees, who stand to receive up to 500 euros annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes whether FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their vote
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week. And this raises the question of whether the FBI findings could get the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview shown on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig up anything that might cause them to change their stance.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
"When I walked in to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened – after the allegations came out – and said, “Did you do that?”
He was steeled, firm and unambiguous."
Graham's voice, on the other hand, appears to be carved in stone.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and other things would require a very vehement accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see how that would change anything."
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York City hosts the Global Citizens Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive array of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end the world’s poverty.
For the seventh time, the Global Citizens Festival will receive tens of thousands of people on Central Park’s large lawn, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will raise awareness of the real goal, which is to end extreme poverty in 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy organization that fights to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
To receive a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must perform a number of tasks or "actions". E.g. do volunteer work, write to a world leader, make a phone call or some other meaningful action that can raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been, now that they have 12 years left to reach the goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert create real change, or is it just another case of so-called “clicktivism” – meaning that people feel they are making a difference by signing a petition online or doing a Twitter post?
Global Citizen reports that since 2011, they have recorded more than 19 million “actions” from their members targeting various targets.
They believe that these actions have spurred world leaders to make binding targets and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which by 2030 is expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 goals and actions that had been created due to their actions, amounting to over $10 billion that had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that these funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main goals is The Power of Nutrition, which is a collaboration between investors and actionable individuals. They strive to “help children live out their full potential” and promise $35 million to alleviate nutrition problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the help of the British government, donors, governments of other countries, and world citizens like you, the social injustice of malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books,” Tracey Ullman, the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the UK government has now promised funds to improve nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 calls online. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with advice on nutrition.
In response to one of the website's frequently asked questions, which reads, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?",
wrote the Global Citizen: "It will be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we will stumble and make mistakes.
But as with the civil rights movement and the movements against apartheid, it will succeed because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year's festival in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are to host.
U.S. could use its navy to “block” Russian energy exports, says U.S. Interior Minister
"If necessary, Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East," Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke told the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for expanding the sale of their energy.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, like they do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"The United States has with our fleet the ability to ensure that there is free passage on the sea lanes, and if it becomes necessary, we can also block them so that we ensure that their energy does not come to market," he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees at a meeting held by the Consumer Energy Alliance – a nonprofit organization that considers itself the "voice of the American energy consumer" –.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they are essentially similar.
"The economic opportunities in relation to Iran and Russia are about exploiting and replacing fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" whose economy relies on fossil fuels.
These statements come after the Trump administration has aimed to increase European exports of liquefied natural gas to replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
To achieve this, Trump administration officials, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump has made Berlin Moscow’s “prisoner.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of unequal conditions of competition and is simply due to economic considerations.
"I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose a supplier," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September.
The position of the Americans is met with criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, BDI, has asked the US to interfere with EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third party interfering in our energy supplies," said the head of BDI, Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'considers' running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren “considers vigorously” running for president after the midterm elections, she said Saturday.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our political system, and that requires a woman at the front," she said.
"After November 6, I will strongly consider running for president."
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during the city council, saying that he is "leading the country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been vocal in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course, the FBI needs to investigate the matter before the vote."
However, a poll from Thursday shows that the majority of Warren's own hinterland does not believe that she should run in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
32% supported the possible candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former governor Deval Patrick with 38% in favor and 48% against a possible run.
Other high-profile Democratic candidates discussed in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator, Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will announce his final decision in January, writes the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's PTSD at a Donald Trump Voter Meeting
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
On Monday, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through after he gets home allows me to relate to other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers are returning home with," she told the audience at a Trump voter turnout meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the "elephant in space" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and become harder. They go and think if there is respect for what their colleagues on land and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, for obstructing the reporting of domestic violence and for possessing a weapon in a state of intoxication, Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the police in Wasillas, said.
18 states and D.C. support opposition to new asylum law
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new U.S. law denying asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. delivered a party-independent statement Friday in support of an asylum seeker who opposes the law.
The full name of the plaintiff in the lawsuit Grace vs. Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal law, has not been made public.
She states that her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of U.S. asylum seekers originated, as countries with far-reaching problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum law overturned a 2014 decision by the U.S. Immigration Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new law "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be determined on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an impediment goes against that principle,” the statement said.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law on rejecting immigrants harms the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become self-employed and "provide necessary labor."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions stripped immigration judges of the right to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political standpoint," Sessions said in his announcement of the law on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems – or just all the serious problems – that people all over the world face every day.
As the death toll doubles, attempts to find survivors in Palu become desperate.
For survivors, the situation only got worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she comforted her little fevered boy at an evacuation center in the ruined city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes in with bodies.
We need clean water.”
Residents now returned to their destroyed homes to sort into soaked possessions and save what they could find.
Several hundred people were injured and the hospitals, which were also hit by the 7.5 earthquake, could not keep up.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were outside Palus military hospital, where patients are being treated outdoors due to severe aftershocks.
He had tears in his eyes as he recounted how the violent earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was being busted up against a broken wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was going to a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife yelling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Improper Methods and Propaganda Ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily that drummed for the benefits of a U.S.-Chinese cooperation, the U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid entry in the Des Moines Register -- Iowa's best-selling newspaper -- after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 congressional election. China denies the allegation.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump’s allegation of Chinese interference in the U.S. election marks a new stage in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in an escalating trade war where they have repeatedly imposed tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs in the trade war were to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts say.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China former governor for a number of years in Iowa, which is a major exporter of agri-food products to China, stated that Beijing has harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a editorial in Sunday's Des Moines Register that China "is escalating the use of the ugliest methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the proud American tradition of free speech and press freedom by running a paid ad on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“In the kiosks here in Beijing, on the other hand, you will find few dissenting voices, and you will not get a fair picture of the Chinese people’s differing views on China’s worrying economic direction, as the media is under the tight control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, though he did not say which.
Republicans alienate women ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
While many top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh against allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that they will experience a backlash in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The case has put emotions on the boil, and most Republicans have already announced that they would like to see the voting process continue.
"This can't be done about," Grant Reher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article Saturday.
Reher said he doubts that Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona)'s request for an FBI investigation at the 11th hour will soften angry voters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday – they don’t forget tomorrow or November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted during a demonstration in the Senate: "November is coming!" as Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation is going to reach new heights," independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg told the news media.
"People say it has already reached a high level; that's right.
But it can reach even higher, especially among female swing voters in the suburbs and younger voters – 18-29-year-olds – who rarely vote, despite not liking the president."
Even before Ford's public accusations of the Supreme Court nominee's sexual assault, analysts had pointed out that it could backfire if Republicans continued with the nomination.
"It's become a worse mess for Republicans," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the start of last week according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final result, or whether Kavanaugh is held accountable; it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they've treated her," Guy Cecil, chairman of Priorities USA, a group that supports Democrats in being elected, told the news channel.
But Americans seem to have shared views on who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with the latter having a bit more on its side.
A recent YouGov poll found that 41% of respondents believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh either probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
At the request of Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other, writes Deborah Ramirez for The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh drunkenly assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her genitals at a party when they were both studying at Yale in the 80s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to make a new Internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, launches a new company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the plan with Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology so people can create their own “personal online data collection” or a POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data collection is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is to pool resources, processes and capabilities to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on a project contract and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team aren’t talking to “Facebook or Google about whether or not they should change everything completely so that all of their business models suddenly become redundant.”
"We're not asking for their permission."
Berners-Lee’s mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new internet being built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about the next period of the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Ecclesiastical recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War I celebrated
The Church of England's only vicar who won the Victoria Cross by fighting during World War I is celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel and Reverend Bernard Wann won the Order on September 29, 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and was never told that he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's order-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from machine guns and artillery."
He later ran up to the front line and led his people forward with the "greatest manhood" before attacking one artilleryman alone and incapacitating three guns.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he "felt very honored to attend the parade" and added that "the support of all these people emphasizes the true heroism."
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but instead got Gurli Gris
Imagine staying up all night to see the star-studded Bellator 206 and being denied the main event.
There were 13 matches on the programme from San Jose, including six matches on the main programme, and they were shown overnight in England on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to meet, viewers in England were somewhat surprised when the transmission switched to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimpressed after they had stayed awake until the early morning for this particular match.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to a children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke."
"According to legislation, this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m., which is why they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president when asked about the broadcast.
"'Grisen Gurli', yes".
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, said they will work to include English viewers in the planning going forward.
"When thinking about the rerun, I think we can make it work," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning over there, and we won't find a solution to that until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the change was made, I got a lot of messages, and they were not all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
In fact, it was the law.
I can promise you it won’t happen next time.
We just have five games instead of six, like we usually do, we tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had "minority" over sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt inferior to everyone else in his upbringing because of his sexuality, but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that he didn't realize until he got into the larger classes that "everyone's not like me."
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that he was less interested in winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The regular host of the long-running radio show, Kirsty Young, has taken some months off due to illness.
Daley was a guest on Laverne's first program and said he felt "less valuable" than everyone else in his upbringing because "it was not socially accepted to like boys and girls."
He said, "Until today, the feelings of feeling worthy and feeling different have been the things that have given me the strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they got to know his sexuality.
The dual Olympic bronze winner has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his participation at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for a decriminalisation of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences, and he would give others "hope".
The triple world champion said he had been "surprised" when he fell in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Last year, Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
He said it’s hard to find someone the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs when you go through so much at such a young age – he went to his first Olympics at 14, and his father died of cancer three years later.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "his whole perspective" had changed".
"If you had asked me last year, it would all be about me winning a gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked was if they had been given tickets for London 2012 – as he would be sitting in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there by then.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and it first dawned on me that he wasn't immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life – diving in front of a home crowd at the Olympics. There was nothing that could beat that feeling,” he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first song choice – Proud by Heather Small – which had meant a lot during the run-up to the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m. BST.
Unsharp Mickelson on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he must do something about the form if it is not to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who sets a record for the 12th time in the competition, which is held every 2 years, was put on the bench by captain Jim Furyk due to Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of events for the United States as usual, the five-time grand winner had to act as a cheerleader and rehearse his game in the hopes of correcting the slips.
Even at the peak of his career, he did not have the most straight drive, which is why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match for the course at Le Golf National, where the long rough often penalizes stray shots.
And if the pitch wasn’t a big enough mouthful, Mickelson will face the ever-accurate winner of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who start the 12 singles games start strong, Mickelson's fight may be crucial.
Furyk expressed unsurprising confidence in his teammate.
"He understood his role completely today, gave me a pat on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of faith in himself.”
He is in the Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams in the past – and also this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought he was going to play more, but that’s how it went, and that’s how it should be.
He wants to be out there like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson beats Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched his individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven draws, though Furyk said his presence contributes something indefinable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, witty, he likes sticking to people, and he's good to have in the team room," he explained.
"I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to watch.
He contributes much more than just the game."
European captain Thomas Bjørn knows that great lead can quickly disappear
European captain Thomas Bjørn knows from experience that a solid lead before the last day of the Ryder Cup singles match can quickly become nerve-wracking.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points over the Americans, but was just about to be caught up before the finish line with a win of 141–2-131–2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice lead in Valderrama, we had a nice lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we only just won", says Bjørn after seeing the 2018 team win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday for a total lead of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
It's going to be full tomorrow.
Go out and do everything right.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal and that is to try to win the trophy and that is where our focus lies.
I’ve always said that I’m focused on the 12 players on our side, but we’re also aware of what’s on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Rejoiced by his players' performance on a difficult pitch, Bjorn added, "I don't take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow, it’s the individual performances that count, and that’s something else entirely.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re tested on all parameters as a golfer.
That’s what the players need to understand – bring out the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now you must leave your partner, for he must also bring out the best in himself."
It looks different for opponent Jim Furyk, who hopes for better individual performance than in the partner game with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced reversals on the last day, first on the winning team in Brookline, before losing when Europe made the "Miracle on the Medinah".
"I remember every word," he said when asked how captain Ben Crenshaw had spoken to his players before the final day in 1999.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to have a good start, as you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When momentum has found a direction, it puts a great deal of pressure on the middle fights.
We put our team together in relation to that and put the players on the pitch in the order we feel like. We try to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the rebound and faces Rory McIlroy in the top fight, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it secures us all the way through," Bjørn said of his choice of singles players.
Germany's new warship launched
The German Navy’s newest frigate should have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War. But the Germans must wait at least a year yet due to technical problems and an escalating price, local media writes.
The deployment of the largest ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, the "Rhineland-Pfalz", has been postponed to the first half of 2019 according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the fleet in 2014, but after-delivery problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, will replace the aging frigates of the Bremen class.
About them you know that they will have a powerful cannon, a large selection of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the newest frigates is a minor need for maintenance: it should be possible to have the frigates away from home ports for up to two years.
But the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which are said to make Germany appear to be an overseas power – will already be obsolete when deployed, writes Die Zeit.
The failed F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware failures" that rendered the warship useless in combat situations.
Software failure was of particular importance as the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be piloted by a crew of 120 sailors – that’s only half of the crew of the older Bremen frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the Navy's ability for future updates.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the price of the project, which includes training the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering $3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), with an initial price of $2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming even more important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German government's defence committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet is "running out of deployment-ready ships."
The official said the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of service without being replaced.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were ready to join the fleet.
National Trust sneaks into the secret life of bats
New research from an area in the Scottish Highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and will help in the work of future conservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland and follows common bats, dwarf bats, long-eared bats and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed in carefully selected locations in the area to record the activities of the bats throughout the season.
Data is also collected by staff from NTS and volunteers using handheld detectors.
In-depth analyses of the sound recordings will reveal the frequencies of the bat calls and show which species does what.
To produce a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour, a report and a map of the habitat are made.
Conservation advisor for NTS Rob Dewar hopes the results reveal which areas of the habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help determine the benefits of habitat conservation efforts such as the establishment of meadows and how best to preserve woodlands for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has fallen dramatically over the past 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect the nests and restrict their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as can fly traps, chemical treatment of building materials and attacks from pets.
In fact, bats are not blind.
But because they primarily hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an advanced echolocation technique to find insects and fly around obstacles.
NTS, which is responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect nests and sometimes conduct rescue operations.
The organisation has even made Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at the area around Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten of Scotland's bat species.
The area's caretaker, David Thompson, says it is an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a really good area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and the whole good habitat.
There’s a lot you don’t know about bats, so working here and elsewhere can help you understand what they need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of looking for bats before performing maintenance tasks on properties, as the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and cubs, thereby risking the extinction of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, annoy or disturb them or their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project manager for the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to lend a hand.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we have, we don't know how populations evolve."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape charges against him "fake news" and says that people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news media Der Spiegel, which brought the accusations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that he paid her $375,000 to keep it secret, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
A few hours after the allegations were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, criticizing the information for being "fake news".
"No, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all is well," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the charges, which they have called "an unforgivable disclosure of suspicions about the privacy sphere".
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player would seek compensation for "moral corruption in a class similar to the accusation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting each other at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to the filed report in the district court in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga alleges that Ronald fell to his knees after the alleged incident, saying he was "a good guy 99% of the time" gripped by "the one percent".
The lawsuits allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly shamed".
The 34-year-old now says she will overturn the deal, as she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was faced with a move from Manchester United to Real Madrid when the incident was supposed to have occurred, and changed to Italian big club Juventus for 100 million euros this summer.
Brexit: Britain 'will forever regret' losing automakers
Britain "will regret it forever" if it lost its status as a leading car manufacturer worldwide after Brexit, business minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily lower production at the factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that longer waiting time at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"The way I see it, production will stop at our factory if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March," Burnaston CEO Marvin Cooke said.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, express fears of leaving the EU without a cross-border trade deal.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers has to do with risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal exit.
Toyota’s production runs on a tight schedule, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems could arise at the border, which, according to the automotive industry, could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's production at the Derbyshire plant, and then production would be stopped, the company said.
Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future negotiations with the EU is "composed to precisely avoid these checks at the border."
"We need to have a deal. We want the best deal, which not only allows us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The opinions of Toyota and other manufacturers indicate that we need to be able to continue what have been successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would have stopped, but in the long run higher prices would reduce the factory's competitiveness, which will ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a joint shop steward at the factory, says his members are becoming increasingly concerned: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they won't come back."
A spokesman for the government said, "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "be postponed one more week" as the showdown around Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein looks over the shoulder of special prosecutor Robert Mueller during his investigation into Russian election interference, connections between Trump’s aides and Russia, and the president’s possible obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thereby risk Mueller’s independence has been a topic of gossip in Washington for months.
The New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein was considering wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the president via the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, and the rumor was that he was going to quit.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled for Thursday with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who have accused him of sexual assault, were to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate election.
Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no set date. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed a week with all that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like to always keep the press updated."
Some journalists would challenge that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to television journalists' games for the gallery, but added, "I don't disagree that they are playing up to the camera."
She then said that the direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
"The president takes more questions from the press than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting a source: "We've looked at the numbers."
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States direct questions, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to provide ample opportunity for it, and you've seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it's going to be in the place of the press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often takes questions when he leaves the White House or attends open hearings or press conferences with senior guests.
Press conferences with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why, when he did an impromptu and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the journalists present.
Health Minister contacts EU staff in Scottish health care after Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS, to express the country's gratitude and desire that they stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than half a year before Britain withdraws from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to paying for the applications for permanent residence of EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued and it appears that decisions are expected in the autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up their preparations for a possible Brexit without a deal.
I know it must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts each individual employee has made, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from within and outside the EU bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare system to the benefit of patients and local communities.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we would very much like you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
The linebacker from the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie was acutely operated after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Tennessee's Mike Organ.
First coach for Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the incident occurred before the break.
"He went out to the sidelines and just fell around out there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before putting him on a stretcher and taking him in for further examination.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie's surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are "no details on the type or extent of the injury yet", and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when he sustained the injury.
Abercrombie is studying in his sophomore year and is embarking on his first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, giving him 18 tackles overall this season.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when buying a house in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK. The extra money, according to the Conservative Party, is supposed to help the homeless.
This move should dampen Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp duty will hit those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects that it will raise 120 million euros a year for the homeless.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp duty when buying properties in the UK, for the benefit of the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to counter Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper housing and going after those with the highest income.
The increase in stamp duty will affect people and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK. The proceeds from this will be used for the government’s fight to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The additional fee, which is added to the current stamp duty and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-home purchases and purchases to rent out, can reach 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects that it can raise 120 million euros per year.
It is estimated that 13% of new construction in London is purchased by people living abroad, which causes prices to rise and makes it harder for first-time buyers to gain a foothold in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in stamp duty to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping property prices up by buying land they don't use. He asked May to drop quotas on cheap housing to solve Britain's "shameful housing situation."
Corbyn has proposed an eye-catching series of housing reforms, including controlling rent prices and depriving the landlord of the ability to put people on the street if they comply with the lease.
He will also strengthen the ability to build public housing.
May said: "Last year I said that I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life is getting better with each generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be that it is as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy homes as it is for hard-working Britons.
For far too many, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the unworthiness of sleeping on the street is still far too widespread."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate goal is to become Scotland's coach'
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "ultimate goal" is at some point to become Scotland's coach.
The Scotsman of 42 is enjoying the challenge of reviving the club from the North East, which now has third place in League One, three points from the top.
He switched to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back in the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played one match with the B team and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland at Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it has always drawn in me.
However, that opportunity would only arise if I was successful in training clubs."
Ross' predecessors as coach of Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says he had no qualms about following such established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I'm measuring success by whether or not I can get this club back in the Premier League.
From the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I'll probably only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years into his career as a coach after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa to come back after being relegated to third-best ranks and transformed St Mirren from the relegation threat to title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he remembers about the time in Alloa.
"I honestly thought the coaching was right for me, more right than being a player.
It sounds strange because I did well, served sensibly and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There are many things that you have to go through on a weekly basis.
There is still that kind of stress and pressure as a coach, but it just feels right.
I've always wanted to train, and now I do. I haven't felt more comfortable with myself in my entire adult life."
You can hear the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12.00 and 13.00 BST.
The best time for a beer is Saturdays at 5:30 p.m., study shows
The heat wave this summer has increased earnings for England's pubs, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
Sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while sales in restaurants have declined 4.8%, figures show.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA who collected the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's unexpectedly long World Cup have meant that July follows June's pattern of pubs experiencing upsells of 2.8%, except that the restaurants are harder hit now.
The decline of 1.8% in restaurants in June only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on the sale of drinks fared best and saw progress corresponding to the decline of the restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food suffered in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
It seems that people just want something to drink.
Across pub and bar chains, sales of beverages increased by 6.6% for the month, while food declined by 3.3%."
Paul Newman, who analyzes the service industry, said: “The results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales in the out-of-home market, the weather and big social or sporting events are the biggest factors.
It’s no surprise that restaurants are still struggling, although a 4.8% drop in sales year after year will hurt a lot on top of rising costs.
The long, hot summer couldn’t come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide much-needed respite.”
The total increase in sales overall for pubs and restaurants including new openings was 2.7% in July, showing the decrease in newly started brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales figures for the English pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes data from 47 different groups. Their annual turnover is more than 9 billion, and they are leaders in the field.
Every fifth child has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – as young as 11 – has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a study.
A survey of 20,000 school students in 4th-9th grade reveals growth in "fake Insta" pages.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted
20% of students said they have a "main account" that they can show their parents
Every fifth child as young as 11 years old creates social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students from the 4th grade onwards reveals violent growth in “fake Insta” accounts – a reference to the photo-sharing service Instagram.
The news has heightened fears of sexual content being posted.
20% of students said they have a "main account" that they can show their parents while they also have private ones.
A mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account saw a teenager urging others to “rape me.”
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) for private schools, found that 40% of 11-18 year olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to having private accounts.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said, "It's scary that so many teenagers are tempted to make online profiles where their parents and teachers can't find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most winning athlete, and chairman Ian Bettie described the shift as a good opportunity for those who make decisions about sports to benefit from her great 10-year experience at the international level.
"Eilidh enjoys great reputation in the athletic world of Scotland, the UK and the rest of the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will be able to benefit from getting her on the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I will try to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help set a direction for sports in Scotland."
The American, who won two of his four Olympic gold medals in the 200- and 400-meter races at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and who is now often a commentator for the BBC, could not go after a transient ischemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: "A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I am completely healthy, have learned to walk again and do today agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
Breast pump advertising comparing mothers to cows gets mixed reception online
A breast pump company has shared its opinion online with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers to cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent breast pump", the tech consumer magazine has released a sarcastic music video-inspired advertisement, which should show the freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a cowshed filled with hay to a song in which it blah. reads: "Yes, I milk myself, but you see no tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, this is not udder, these are my breasts."
The refrain reads: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my baby, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my bosom."
But the advertisement, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed reception from viewers. Many say that it makes fun of the "horror" of the milk industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must conceive and give birth before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth,” wrote one user.

Another wrote: "Understoodly traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added, "What an insensitive advertisement."
Others defended the ad. One woman admitted that she thought the song was "incredibly funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would have had one.
Breastfeeding made me feel exactly like a cow.
The advertising is a bit crazy, but I took it for what it was.
“It’s a great product,” he wrote.
Another commented: "It's a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who pump milk (often in their workplace or in toilets) and feel like 'cows'.
It is not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the advertisement is based on the fact that many women who breastfeed say that they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely silent, has no tubes or hoses and fits discreetly in a nursing bra, giving the women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, Partner and CEO of Mother, wrote: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the challenges of breast pumping, while demonstrating in an entertaining and recognisable way the freedom that the new pump can provide.”
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
In London Fashion Week, a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Secretly Moved to Texas Border Tent Camp
The number of detainee migrant children has exploded, although the number of border crossings has not changed. This is partly due to a tougher rhetoric and the Trump administration’s tougher laws that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared for their ability to stay in the country by standing up and receiving a child.
The risk of repatriation increased in June when authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household should provide fingerprints and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement official, testified before Congress that they had arrested several individuals seeking to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had clean criminal records.
Close to 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors' households are staying illegally in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
So we're still chasing those people," Albence said.
In an effort to deal with children's cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention. Previously, it was within 60 days, aid workers say.
Many people use video calls instead of even showing up and pleading their case for legal residency to an immigration judge.
Those who are sentenced to ineligible stay are deported quickly.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to have anxiety or depression that can lead to violent outcomes or attempted escapes, according to aid workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
People who advocate for better conditions say these risks are more pronounced at larger facilities like Tornillo, where size makes it harder to keep an eye on whether a child is suffering.
They added that moving to a tented village without mental preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to friends can accumulate trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria announces U.S., French and Turkish "occupying forces" to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that the stay of foreign forces in the country is illegal and on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and they will "be met with similar means."
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror is "almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have fled their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this decisive war until we have purged all Syrian areas" of both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising Kurdish and Syrian-Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-torn country.
In the area of refugees, Moualem said conditions were good enough for them to return home, after which he accused "some Western countries" of "spreading unfounded fear" that caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help facilitate these repatriations," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be made available to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel-controlled city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
Due to the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack by Syrian forces, supported by Russia, was avoided against the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will go after jihadists from the Nusra Front, a progenitor group of Al-Qaeda, which "will be wiped out".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the new committee's first meetings soon to outline a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for an election. The committee consists of government and opposition members.
Moualem has set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the legislation of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Trump wins another presidency.
Based on that logic, Trump will probably be re-elected in 2020, unless the impeachment and scandals end his presidency ahead of time, as many liberal viewers probably hope.
In what will undoubtedly be "The most dramatic end to a presidential term ever!"
Currently, there is no sign of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, ratings in prime time have nearly doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime time viewers compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has the most viewers with up to 3.5 million on evenings of big news.
"It's a spectacle that people are attracted to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, who heads the ABC drama Designated Survivor about a leader of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and writer behind "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Scovell said.
Chaos has entertainment value.
But unlike any other TV show, the stories coming from Washington can decide the case between Roe and Wade whether refugee families can be reunited and the health of the world economy.
Changing the channel is only for the most privileged.
And yet, it’s about more than being an enlightened citizen when you watch six-hour panel discussion where experts discuss Bob Woodward’s use of “deep background” when he wrote his book “Fear”; Paul Manafort’s 15,000-$ (“covered with hubris,” wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels’ vivid descriptions of Trump’s anatomy.
I don’t think I’ll ever see Super Mario the same way.
“One of the things that makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about the Trump show’s rotating crew and daily surprises.
But if you miss a paragraph, you're dismissed.
When I got to Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was to be heard in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was to be decided.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows in the past and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large sums find their way to the close mid-term elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district receives large sums of money. As a result of an equalization of two "Congressional Districts" two congressmen are fighting for the same seat.
This recently realigned suburban district of Pittsburg is causing trouble for Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another sitting congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, who overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The cards were rescheduled after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district was illegally set up in Republican favor.
The struggle for the new 17th District has started a struggle for financial means between the major party committees, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a high-profile election in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seat has been in the hands of Republicans for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a small advantage.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but changed its mind
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners threw Trump's management team out.
State Department officials decided to recall senior U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, State Department spokeswoman in a statement earlier this month.
But it was only El Salvador that was punished. They received about 140 million US dollars in 2017 for among other things drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a summit conference on security and economic development. It was to have continued last year's meeting, which was considered to be a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, top officials made it clear they would have the conference take place anyway, thus dropping consideration of penalties to El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to send a signal of the importance that Americans place in the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys secretly went back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh demands or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the case, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who would like to talk about the internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst, who is close to the administration, and who also spoke on the basis of a condition of anonymity.
Know the history
The next obstacle could well be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible impediment to the investigation, for which there is considerable and publicly available evidence.
Mueller said he would also direct his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign secretly cooperated with Russia in the attack on the election.
If Congress were to get into new hands, Trump would likely be held accountable as he prepares to meet again with voters and, in time, a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertainties, and I’m not claiming that Trump’s end is inevitable – and so are his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
By 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had been able to resist him by supporting the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage thereafter.
It is around such turning points that the axis of history turns, and the inevitable march of democracy increases or decreases.
The United States is now facing several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who decides the future of Mueller’s investigation, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been hot since the present newspaper could announce that he had proposed last year to make covert recordings of the president and disputed his suitability for office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times's presentation is inaccurate.
"How do we react if the F.B.I.'s recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is suspended or not properly conducted - or if he is approved by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And, more importantly, will we vote for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy's homeland.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath candle on the table with the swastika.

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic ahead of the match against SK Rapid Wien
After the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, with a win against the Austrians, they will have good opportunities to move on from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his season debut before the 2-2 game against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone to something even bigger.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the game with the belief that we could bring something home and we got a point.
Maybe we could have taken the plug home, but all in all, it was probably a reasonable result.
They were probably the best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they got a good result in the last match. But with the audience behind us, I am sure that we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
The last year has been tough because of all that has happened with my injuries and the changes at the club, but the atmosphere is good now.
The team is good, and the boys are really enjoying it.
Hopefully we can run on now, put last season behind us and be successful."
Anxiety over retirement makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the study participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked to the family about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationswide study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“Most people would like a family member to take care of them, but they don’t do anything to initiate the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationswide’s life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t tell them about your wishes in good time.
Use your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices can be determining factors for the cost.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term care can, among other things, be financed by means of a traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payment or self-insurance with your own funds – as long as you have the finances for it.
Get the legal documents sorted: Take the legal battles in the bud.
Get a power of attorney so that you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure that doctors and medical staff comply with your wishes, in case you cannot communicate yourself.
Also consider an economic power of attorney.
In this case, you appoint a trusted person who can make financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you do not have the opportunity to do so yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that one of your aging parents needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.

Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a trip to the city.
The victim was in his 40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon when he was shot in the chest, diaphragm and hand.
Officers describe the shooting, which occurred at about 2:30 a.m., as "completely random."
The victim did not see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are urging witnesses to come forward.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities say, expecting the number to increase.
As the communication routes are out of play, relief workers have been unable to receive information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake struck.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that spans more than 300 km of coastline on the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the Central Sulawesi economy, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but takes place mainly in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala, according to Indonesia's disaster center, have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed several hundred houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was hit again by a tsunami which killed nine.
Indonesia is seismologically located on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26 that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, including over half of those in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit Sumatra's west coast in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake measuring 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake struck Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, spreading destruction and panic as the population was reminded of 2004's deadly earthquake and tsunami.
A tsunami was not triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapsing buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left several thousand tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of notification of domestic violence and to oppose arrest, according to the report issued Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he picked up the phone from a female acquaintance as she attempted to report the alleged crime.
Palin is in custody in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a bail of $500 unsecured, reports KTUU.
He was tried on Saturday, declaring himself "clearly not guilty," the network reports.
Palin is charged with three Class A violations, which could lead to a prison sentence of up to one year and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B offense, which could lead to a single day in prison penalty and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the assault.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing the notification of a violent crime at home as well as possession of weapons in an affected state in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran groups after explaining her son's violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his posting to Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: several hundred dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake on Friday struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami, which destroyed several hundred homes.
The area is without electricity and communication routes, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just south of central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media, videos are circulating that show the moment where the earthquake hits.
Several hundred people were gathered at a beach party in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public prosecutors try to have terror suspect in NYC sentenced to rare death penalty
Public prosecutors are trying to impose the death penalty on Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people – a rare punishment that was last imposed for a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rental car from the Home Depot construction market to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who got in the way were mowed down.
As a basis for the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious personal injury. This is required by the Declaration of Intent for the Death Penalty in New York's Southern District.
According to the court document, the death penalty is a possible result of both these charges.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury was able to present Saipov with a 22-point indictment, including eight counts of murder related to gangster activity, which are typically used by public prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "extensive planning and preparation," the prosecutors said, describing Saipov's execution as "monstery, vicious and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, bodily harm and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the letter of intent reads.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last raised the defendant in a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but ended up receiving life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was most recently imposed in a New York state case in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov hailed from Uzbekistan and, according to the judicial documents, showed no signs of remorse in the days and months after the attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he was fine with his actions.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be hung in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the 22 counts of the indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that they were "of course disappointed" with the prosecutors' decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma for all those involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Conservative minister says NIGEL FARAGE should take over Brexit talks
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a demonstration at the Conservative meeting today.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians could “feel the pressure” from the Eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May’s own ministers had stated that Farage should take over negotiations with the EU.
Private Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the demonstration in Birmingham that Britain would have "been out now" if Farage had been a Brexit negotiator.
May’s challenge to create unity in the deeply divided party is underlined by Conservatives participating in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan on track under attack from both brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Her allies insist that despite the setback, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or "chaos".
For the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull, Bone announced that he would scrap the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
The minister from Wellingborough added, "I will fight for Brexit, but we need to scrap Chequers."
Regarding the background to his EU resistance, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be anyone's subordinate.
We will determine our own laws in our own country."
Bone denied that public opinion should have changed since the 2016 vote: "That the British people should have changed their minds and would like to stay in the EU is completely wrong."
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also attended the demonstration and told reporters, "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is unpopular with the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular with our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the streets getting us elected.
Now drop the Chequers, and start listening."
As a pointed remark to May, she added, "Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the parade that politicians should be able to "feel the pressure" if they fail the decision from the vote in 2016.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
“They will betray Brexit, but we are here to tell them that we will not let them get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “You need to make sure that the political class that is on the verge of betraying Brexit can feel the pressure.
"We are mobilising the people's army here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain."
Meanwhile, remainers marched through Birmingham before a two-hour procession in the city centre.
Scattered activists waved Conservatives Against Brexit banners after the formation of the group this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis joked before the meeting about the security problems with the Conservatives' party app.
"It's the people who claim to be managing the IT systems and technology for Canada, for the border controls, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he said.
"That's ridiculous.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren 'considers' to run for president
U.S. House of Representatives Senator Elizabeth Warren is "considering strongly to run for president" after the November midterm elections.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future during a city council meeting on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticized Donald Trump, will seek re-election in November against the state's Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It has been speculated that she would challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters at City Hall since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she plans to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time for "women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and that requires a woman in front."
Arrest in case of shooting at LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the shooting at Wayde Sims, the basketball player from LSU.
Police in Baton Rouge announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested Friday for an ET news meeting at 11 p.m.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday to ask for help identifying a man on the footage.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died from the injuries," police chief Murphy J. Paul said.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to having been present, possessing a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without issue and is now in police custody in the East Baton Rouge district.
Sims was a two-meter high third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. Last season he played 32 games, started inside ten and played an average of 17.4 minutes, scoring 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the World Cup, after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a crucial role for the race.
From the lead Bottas got off to a good start and was close to unhinging Hamilton completely when he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove in the pit as the first, and left Hamilton to fight with the traffic at the back of the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes car went into pit one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back in front when after some wheel contact, the Ferrari driver reluctantly had to leave the inner lane after a double defense at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was number seven after the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race when, in an attempt for a quick finish, he failed to change tyres to take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth place.
He had to go in the pit on the 44th lap, but could not increase the pace on the last eight laps, so Raikkonen secured fourth place.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri made it great all weekend and was really a gentleman when he let me pass.
The team did an incredible job to secure us both first and second place," said Hamilton.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election rally Saturday because she insisted she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sex assault.
At a voter meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony Ford had given before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that the events in the Senate showed that people were "vicious and obnoxious and dishonest".
"The one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and vicious and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks, and then they say, 'Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember her answer... Was it you who leaked the document – "Uh, uh, what?
No, no.
I haven't leaked anything."
Hey, wait a minute.
Have we leaked... No, we haven't leaked anything," he added in an imitation of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter about Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's allegations, and I haven't leaked her story," Feinstein told the committee according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I have."
But her denial was not well received by the president, who said during Saturday's voter turnout: "I tell you it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
During the president’s continued defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexually assaulting three women, Trump suggested that Democrats use the accusations to benefit their own cause.
"They are shunning no means in their efforts to take back power.
You can see the meanness, the abominations, they don't care who they have to drum up for power and control," the president said according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made amends after Friday's lost Elite League game against the Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly came ahead with two goals with attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized at home before Dwyer again brought the Giants in front.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the win by two more goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's team, which came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Friday's match in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides, with the Giants going out as victors in the previous three games.
Dwyer posted in the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assist from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as an assist, as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt was behind Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants got ahead at the first break when he scored his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard equalised again with a nice goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second period, and he secured the win with the team's fifth goal halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their five games, are home to Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller killed to ensure hundreds of air passengers avoided earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane carrying several hundred passengers arrived safely on the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake on Friday struck Sulawesi island, triggering a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks still ravage the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung's colleagues fled for their lives, he refused to leave his place in the swaying control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed back in his seat to make sure Batik Air Flight 6321, which stayed on the runway, got off the air safely.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was about to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We procured a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are devastated," he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach several thousand, and the country's disaster response announces that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins and it is not possible to arrive at them," said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six-meter-high waves have destroyed Palu, which is holding a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are flying relief and supplies in.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News, "Every minute a new ambulance comes with more bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
All the shops have been looted."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're getting at.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military, "I ask you all to work around the clock to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he said, according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombrok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one man missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, now says that a man is missing, even though it had previously been reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said it could not locate a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline announced it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned requests for more information about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital until Saturday, and that they were all in stable condition.
It is still not clear what caused the crash and the exact order of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both state that the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses believed the plane was flying past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed in very shallow water.
"That was really lucky," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers could go into water to get to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the crew panicked and yelled, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors working on renovating a nearby wharf also helped in the rescue effort by using a rubber boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank at a depth of about 30 meters.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analyst establishes timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its evidence on Saturday during the appeal for a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used telecommunications information to piece together the course of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he got location data from several different cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicted his previous claims, writes The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers's cell phone at the time when he had alleged that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police visited Sanford.
Sanford sat down on the stand Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He deleted her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that day.
The High Breed: What is Political Hip-Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol believes that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to the starting point and make political hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently been given a revival in the UK due to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Babysitter in New York sues couple after firing with 'racist' text message
A New York City nanny sues a couple for discriminatory firing after receiving a text message by mistake from her mother complaining that she was "yet another black person".
The couple denied that they are racists, but compared the lawsuit to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay at finding out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEJ, NOT A SORT PERSON," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she would send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, the "inconvenient" Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice, saying that their former nanny, as from African-American, had been bad at her job and that she was expecting a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one-day work and sent home in an Uber.
Now Giselle Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal as well as compensation for $350 a day during the six months in which she was supposed to have lived with the family, even though this was agreed without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't afford to do something like that," she told the newspaper Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have defended themselves that they are not racists and that the firing of Maurice was justified because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife had come to send her something that she wouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco told The Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone whom you had been rude to, even if it had happened by mistake?
Your baby?
Oh, come on."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "extortion" and that his wife had given birth two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you really going after someone like that?”
It's not very kindly done," added the investment advisor.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the People's Court has already written off the couple on social media and shamed their behavior and logic.
New letter reveals Paddington publisher feared readers could not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was recorded for publication, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine being the one to read it for the first time before it was published.
It's pretty fun to read now that you know how popular Paddington became."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small teddy bear, would have been optimistic, though his story was rejected, and that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "bittersweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father, in all modesty, was proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't like to brag," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt like you had a child who achieved something: you're proud of them, even if it's not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he used to say it was Paddington's fault."
Saying Goodbye to a Dying Child on the Phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called periodically to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn't survive," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that she was going to die within the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll see you soon.
See ya.
The medication she had been given to keep her heart going slowly lost its effect.
She had died a short time before, and now her body was shutting down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to pull myself together.”
Eventually, the grieving Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I bowed my head, and the tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving women try to stop suicide jumpers
Two women who have lost relatives to suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up maps on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he suffered a depression, and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to experience the sadness I go through every day," she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising chef with an infected smile.
"His smile was familiar to everyone.
People said his smile lit up the room."
However, he stopped working before he died because he felt really bad.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him after he took his life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid it'll spread."
Sharon Davis made the cards to "tell people that there is someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don’t go with your thoughts yourself – you have to talk to someone.”
Sharon Davis' longtime friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost her boyfriend of 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about him being sad or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, he started to change.
When the children opened their presents, he had no eye contact with them at all."
She said that his death was very traumatic for them, but that they have to get through it: "It has created a gap in our family.
It has torn us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still unsettled as the FBI begins investigation
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked for – a time-limited investigation with limited scope – we might get a bit of agreement," Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee "fell from the hind" amid the stalemate of the split situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct their investigation?
Their reluctance is due to the timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if Republicans, as expected, are doing poorly, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they would like elected to the country's highest judicial office.
George W. Bush has called on senators to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI completes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the deciding vote and elect him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors 'falls' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from South Korea's unification ministry, saying there were 1,127 defectors last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human traffickers were instrumental in the change in numbers.
Pyongyang has not made any official comments.
The vast majority of North Koreans are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
South Korea says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border adjacent to North Korea, and which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the defectors as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, so they are often forcibly repatriated.
Relations between North and South Korea – which are technically still at war – have improved markedly over the last few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to talk about the stalled negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This comes after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korea on an overall level.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no belief in our national security, and in such circumstances it is out of the question that we will disarm on our own," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit for the Supreme Court
Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for Supreme Court justice, "hysterical" and said his temper was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi's comment came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved that way, you would have called her hysterical," Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally dismissed the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he talked about his family and his years in high school, he almost screamed and was about to cry.
He also denounced the Democrats on the committee and called the accusations against him "grotesque and a coordinated character courage" organized by the left, who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidency in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's statement proved he could not sit on the Supreme Court because it showed he is biased towards the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with the statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi was asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say that if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit to sit on the Supreme Court, but certainly rather in the court he's sitting in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge on the Washington, D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions related to Obama's health reform or the abortion case Roe v. Wade, because he is considered to be a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would reverse certain previous Supreme Court decisions.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, biased person should hold a job as a judge and expect us to say 'well, it's not just great,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It’s a fair outcome, months and years of anger, and she can’t get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal.
She continued: "I got a lot of support from a woman who was the boss, who said that she also cried when she got angry, but that she developed a technique which meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to: "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with a preponderance of men, where I often cried with anger, where I was taken by the neck of an older woman – a cold boss that I had always been a little afraid of – and pulled out onto the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sorry, and they’ll be glad they got you.”
Patricia Schroeder, who at the time was a member of Congress for the Democrats from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to be having an affair on a boat named Monkey Business and withdrew as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and came to the conclusion that she might as well run for president herself.
"It wasn't a very well thought out decision," she said laughing to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and they certainly didn't need another candidate.
Some called it 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind on fundraising, so she promised she would not participate unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do you think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she gave a speech about her not wanting to run, she was overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so hard to raise money and reach out to voters instead of electors, and anger at sexism – that she got a lump in her throat.
“You’d think I’d have a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my gravestone?
“She was crying?”
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were loud, and although the battle is far from over, discord between the countries could be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation this week, with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods, applies in principle to half of all goods imported into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time, most recently by imposing tariffs of 5-10% on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to follow the U.S. all the way, and the world’s second-largest economy probably won’t give in just yet.
If it gets Washington to withdraw its demands, it means they give in, but for China’s president, Xi Jinping, it would be far too embarrassing to bow to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, US pressure in the trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
"A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can create a breeding ground for an economy that can get out of control in both countries, and it's actually much more dangerous than you thought," said Abigail Grace, research associate focusing on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' to accept refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the refugees to return, and asks for help to rebuild the country devastated by the more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government remains in control of the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore a normal state of affairs.
All the conditions are now in place for refugees to return to the country they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people still in the country are in need of emergency aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would gladly accept help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that helped support the rebellion.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup and beat the American team 16.5 - 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy back when Captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points it required to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, shot his drive into the lake on par 3 on the 16th hole, causing him to lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari did well in all rounds and became 1 out of a total of 4 players, having received 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament's current format started.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 by the lowest ranked European player, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
No. 1 on the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in his luggage, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's most winning European with 25.5 career points.
"I don't normally cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really happy to get the trophy back.
It's a team effort and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch on to his compatriot John Ram, who dropped American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singles match Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It’s a fun statistic for one of the best golfers ever, having won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding form throughout the weekend with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, said after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of the guys, because they fought for the cause.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe a counter-measure.
We lost.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will regroup, and I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and then we will move on.
I love the 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take off your hat.
We were defeated."
Algal bloom update: Concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that there is a general decreasing algae concentration in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, scattered blooms are reported in the area around Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – suggesting that concentration is decreasing.
The bloom of algae spreads over a coastline of 210 km from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
There are smaller blooms about 10 miles (16 km) from the coast in Hillsborough County, but there are fewer than last week.
There have also been sightings in Pasco County.
Medium concentrations in or at sea have been reported in Pinellas County over the past week, low to high concentrations in the ocean off in Hillsborough County, background concentration to high concentrations in Manatee County, background concentration to high concentrations in or in the ocean off Sarasota County, background concentration to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, background concentration to high concentrations in or in the ocean off Lee County and low concentrations in Collier County.
Breathing difficulties continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
No respiratory problems have been reported in northwestern Florida in the past week.
