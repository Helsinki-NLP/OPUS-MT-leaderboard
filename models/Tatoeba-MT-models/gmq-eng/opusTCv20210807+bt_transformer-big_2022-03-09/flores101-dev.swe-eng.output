Protests also took place in Paris, Sofia in Bulgaria, Vilnius in Lithuania, Valetta in Malta, Tallinn in Estonia as well as Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland.
In London, about 200 people protested outside the offices of some major copyright holders.
Last month, major protests were held in Poland when the country signed ACTA, leading to the Polish government deciding not to ratify the agreement until further notice.
Latvia and Slovakia have both postponed the process of joining ACTA.
Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) are calling again for the installation of CCTV cameras in all Australian slaughterhouses.
Chief Inspector David O'Shannessy of the RSPCA New South Wales told ABC that surveillance and inspections of slaughterhouses should be standard in Australia.
""Surveillance photos would certainly send a strong signal to those working with animals that their welfare is a top priority.""
The United States Geological Survey earthquake map did not show any earthquakes in Iceland in the previous week.
The Icelandic Weather Office also reported no earthquake activity in the Hekla area in the last 48 hours.
The noticeable earthquake activity that led to the phase change occurred on March 10 on the northeast side of the volcano's peak caldera.
Dark clouds, which had nothing to do with volcanic activity, had been observed at the base of the mountain.
The clouds created potential for confusion as to whether an actual eruption had occurred.
The Luno had 120-160 cubic metres of fuel on board when it broke and heavy winds and waves pushed it into the breakwater.
The 12 crew members were rescued by helicopter, and the only injury was a broken nose.
The 100-meter-long ship was on its way to pick up its usual cargo of fertilizer, and authorities initially feared that the ship might spill some of its cargo.
The proposed amendment was voted through in both houses in 2011.
A change was implemented during this legislative session, where the second sentence was first removed by the House of Representatives, and then passed in a similar form by the Senate on Monday.
The failure of the second sentence, which proposes a ban on same-sex civil unions, could possibly open the door to civil unions in the future.
After the preparation, HJR-3 will be reviewed again by the next elected legislature, either in 2015 or 2016 to keep the process active.
Vautier's accomplishments in addition to directing include a 1973 hunger strike against what he felt was political censorship.
French law was changed. His activism went back to when he was 15 years old, when he joined the French resistance during World War II.
He documented himself in a book in 1998.
In the 1960s he went back to Algeria, which had recently become independent to teach film direction.
Japanese judo athlete Hitoshi Saito, who has won two Olympic gold medals, has died at the age of 54.
The cause of death was reported as intrahepatic bile duct cancer.
He died in Osaka on Tuesday.
In addition to his status as Olympic champion and world champion, Saito was at the time of his death also chairman of the All Japan Judo Federation Training Committee.
At least 100 people attended the party to celebrate the anniversary of the couple who married last year.
A formal celebration of the anniversary was planned to be held at a later date, according to authorities.
The couple had married in Texas a year earlier and came to Buffalo to celebrate with family and friends.
The 30-year-old man, who was born in Buffalo, was one of the four killed in the shooting, but his wife was not injured.
Karno is a well-known but controversial English teacher at Modern Education and King's Glory who claimed to have 9,000 students at the top of his career.
In his notes, he used words that some parents considered rough, and reportedly used profanity during classes.
Modern Education accused him of printing large advertisements on buses without permission as well as lying by saying that he was the chief English tutor.
He has also previously been accused of copyright infringement but was not charged.
"A former student said he ""used slang in class, taught dating skills through notes and was just like the students' friend.""
Over the past three decades, China has developed a market economy, even though it is officially still a communist state.
The first economic reforms were carried out under Deng Xiaoping's leadership.
Since then, China’s economy has grown by 90 times.
Last year, for the first time, China exported more cars than Germany and surpassed the United States as the largest market for this industry.
China's GDP could be larger than that of the United States within two decades.
Hurricane Danielle, the fourth named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, which is located approximately 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has a maximum wind strength of 64 km/h.
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will increase in strength to a hurricane by Wednesday.
Since the storm is far from land, it is still difficult to assess potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
Bobek, born in the Croatian capital Zagreb, became famous when he played for Partizan Belgrade.
He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958.
During his time on the team, he scored 403 goals on 468 occasions.
No one has ever played more games or scored more goals for the club than Bobek.
In 1995, he was voted Partizan's best player of all time.
The celebration began with a special performance by the world-famous group Cirque du Soleil.
It was followed by the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, a Janissary band, and the singers Fatih Erko? and M?sl?m G?rses.
Then the swirling dervishes took the stage.
The Turkish diva Sezen Aksu performed with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
"In conclusion, the dance group Fire of Anatolia from Turkey performed the performance ""Troja""."
Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old motorcycle racer, has died after suffering a crash at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
During the warm-up lap, Lenz fell off his motorcycle and was subsequently hit by his fellow racer Xavier Zayat.
He was immediately cared for by paramedics on the spot and transported to a local hospital, where he later died.
Zayat survived the accident unscathed.
As for the global economic situation, Zapatero went on to say that ""the financial system is part of the economy, a crucial part."
We have a financial crisis that has lasted for a year, where the last two months have been the most acute, and I think the financial markets are now starting to recover."
Last week, Naked News announced a dramatic increase in its international language mandate for news reporting, with three new broadcasts.
The global organisation is already reporting in English and Japanese, and now Spanish, Italian and Korean programmes are also being launched for TV, web and mobile devices.
"Fortunately, nothing happened to me, but I saw a macabre scene when people tried to smash windows to get out."
People hit the windows with chairs, but the windows were unbreakable.
"One of the windows was finally smashed and they started coming out the window," said survivor Franciszek Kowal.
Stars emit light and heat due to the energy created when hydrogen atoms merge to form heavier elements.
Scientists are working on building a reactor that can create energy in the same way.
However, this is a very difficult problem to solve and it will be many years before we see ready-made, usable fusion reactors.
The steel needle floats on top of the water due to the surface tension.
Surface tension occurs when water molecules at the water surface are attracted more strongly to each other than to the molecules in the air above them.
"The water molecules form an invisible ""skin"" on the water surface, causing things like the needle to float on top of the water."
The rail of a modern skate has a double edge with a concave groove between them. The two edges allow a better grip on the ice, even when tilted.
When the underside of the rail is slightly curved, the edge that is in contact with the ice is also curved when the rail is tilted to one side or the other.
This causes the skater to turn. If the skates tilt to the right, the skater turns to the right, if the skates tilt to the left, the skater turns to the left.
To return to their previous energy level, they must get rid of the extra energy they received from the light.
They do this by sending out a photon, which is a small particle of light.
"Scientists call this process ""stimulated emission of radiation"", because the atoms are stimulated by the bright light, which causes the emission of a photon of light, and light is a type of radiation."
The next picture shows how the atoms emit photons. In reality, the photons are of course much smaller than those in the picture.
Photons are even smaller than the constituents of an atom!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the filament finally burns off and the bulb ceases to function.
Then the bulb needs to be replaced. It is important to be careful when replacing the bulb.
First, the switch to the lamp fixture must be turned off or the cord disconnected.
This is because electricity flows to the plinth where the metallic part of the bulb sits and can give you a powerful shock if you touch the inside of the plinth or the metal base of the bulb when it is partially inserted into the plinth.
The main organ of the cardiovascular system is the heart, which pumps the blood.
Blood originates from the heart in tubes called arteries and returns to the heart in tubes called veins. The narrowest tubes are called capillaries.
The teeth of a tieratops could have crushed not only leaves but also very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that triceratops ate cycads, which is a kind of plant that was common during the Cretaceous.
These plants look like a small palm with a crown of sharp, thorny leaves.
A Triceratops could have used its strong beak to pull the leaves off before eating up the tree trunk.
Other researchers claim that these plants are highly toxic and that it is unlikely that any dinosaur ate them, although today's sloths and other animals such as the parrot (a descendant of the dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruit.
If you were standing on Io's surface, you'd weigh less than you do on Earth.
A person weighing 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io. So of course gravity draws less in you.
The sun has no crust like the Earth that you can stand on. The whole sun is made up of gases, fire and plasma.
The gas gets thinner the further you get from the core of the sun.
"The outermost part that we see when we look at the sun is called the photosphere, which means ""bulb of light""."
About three thousand years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to see that Venus has phases, just like the moon has.
Phases occur because only the side of Venus (or the Moon) facing the Sun is illuminated. The phases of Venus gave support to Copernicus' theory that the planets move around the Sun.
A few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks saw a transit of Venus.
England experienced a long period of peace after the re-conquest of the Danelaw.
In 991, however, Ethelred was met by a Viking fleet larger than any since Guthrum's a century earlier.
This fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian with the ambition to retake his country from Danish domination.
After suffering adversity at first, Ethelred managed to reach an agreement with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try with mixed success to win his kingdom.
Hangul is the only intentionally invented alphabet in common daily usage. The alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450).
King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty and is one of the most highly regarded.
"From the beginning, he named the Hangeul alphabet Hunmin Jeongeum, which means ""the right sounds for the enlightenment of the people"".
There are many theories about how Sanskrit came to be. One of them is about how an Aryan migration from the west into India brought the language.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is comparable to the Latin language spoken in Europe.
The earliest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the compilation of the Upanishads, Sanskrit gradually disappeared due to hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a complex and rich language that has given rise to many modern Indian languages, in the same way that Latin forms the basis of European languages such as French and Spanish.
When the Battle of France was over, Germany began to prepare for the invasion of the island of Great Britain.
"Germany used the code name ""Operation Sea Lion"" for the attack. Most of the British Army's heavy weapons and supplies had been lost when evacuated from Dunkirk, so the army was quite weak."
"But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy ("Kriegsmarine") and could destroy any invasion fleet sent across the English Channel."
However, few Royal Navy ships were based near likely invasion routes because the admirals were afraid they would be sunk by German air attacks.
"Let's start with an explanation of Italy's plans. Italy was essentially the "little brother" of Germany and Japan.""
They had a weaker army and a weaker fleet, even though they had built four new ships just before the war began.
Italy was mainly after African countries. To conquer these, a springboard was needed for the Italian troops, so that they could sail across the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
For that, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt; beyond that, Italy's warships would do nothing.
Now to Japan. Japan was an island nation, just like Great Britain.
Submarines are vessels that are designed to travel underwater and remain there for an extended period of time.
Submarines were used during the First and Second World Wars. At that time they were very slow and had a very limited range.
At the beginning of the war, they mostly traveled in overwater mode but as the radar evolved and became more accurate, the submarines were forced below the surface to avoid being detected.
The Germans had submarines that they were very good at controlling and handling.
Due to its success with submarines, Germany was not allowed to have many of them after the war.
"Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes called ""King Tut"" or ""The Boy King"", is one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings of modern times."
Interestingly, he was not considered particularly important in ancient times and was not registered in most ancient king lists.
But the discovery of his grave in 1922 made him a celebrity. While many older graves were looted, this grave was left virtually untouched.
Most of the artifacts buried with Tutankhamun have been well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made from precious metals and rare stones.
The invention of spoked wheels made the Assyrian wagons lighter, faster, and better equipped to run faster than soldiers and other wagons.
Arrows from their deadly crossbows were able to penetrate the armor of enemy soldiers. Around 1000 BC, the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
A cavalry is an army fighting on horseback. The saddle had not yet been invented, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on the horses' bare backs.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Perhaps the most famous person from this culture is Homer, the legendary blind poet who wrote two of the masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems The Iliad and The Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular screenwriters and their plays are considered among the greatest works in world literature.
Another famous Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras who is best known for his famous theorem about the relationship between the sides of right-angled triangles.
There are different estimates for how many people speak Hindi. It is estimated to be the second and fourth most spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers varies depending on whether similar dialects are included.
Estimates vary between 340 million and 500 million speakers and as many as 800 million people can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu have similar vocabulary but the written language differs; in everyday conversations, speakers in both languages can usually understand each other.
Around the 15th century, Germany had a great cultural influence in northern Estonia.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the natives, so they constructed the Estonian script.
"It was based on the German alphabet and a letter """/"" was added."
Over time, many words borrowed from the German were joined together. This was the beginning of the enlightenment.
After finishing school, the heir to the throne would traditionally go directly into the military.
However, Charles attended the University of Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and later history, and received a grade of 2:2 (a grade of lower second grade).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to graduate from university.
European Turkey (Eastern Thrace or Rumelia in the Balkan Peninsula) comprises 3% of the country.
The Turkish territory is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 miles) long and 800 km (500 miles) wide, with approximately a rectangular shape.
Turkey's area, including lakes, occupies 783,562 square kilometres (300,948 sq mi), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 sq mi) is counted as Southwest Asia and 23,764 square kilometres (9,174 sq mi) is counted as Europe.
Turkey's area makes the country the 37th largest in the world and is as large as France (the mother country) and the United Kingdom combined.
Turkey is surrounded by sea on three sides: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but its independence dates back to 1839.
Parts of present-day Belgium formerly belonged to Luxembourg but became Belgian after the Belgian Revolution of the 1830s.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country but was occupied both in World War I and World War II by Germany.
In 1957, Luxembourg became a founding member of the organization known today as the European Union.
Drukgyal Dzong is a fortruin and a Buddhist monastery in the upper part of Paro District (in Phondey village).
It is said that in 1649 Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel created the fortress to celebrate his victory over the Tibetan-Mongol forces.
In 1951, a fire left only some of Drukgyal Dzong's remains, such as the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fort was preserved and protected, and remains as one of Bhutan's most sensational attractions.
In the 18th century, Cambodia found itself sandwiched between two powerful neighboring countries, Thailand and Vietnam.
Thailand invaded Cambodia several times during the 17th century and in 1772 they destroyed Phnom Phen.
During the last years of the 18th century, the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of those who have jobs work in the informal economy.
Two-thirds of Venezuelans who work do so in the service sector, nearly a quarter work in industry and a fifth work in agriculture.
An important industry for Venezuelans is oil, and the country is a net exporter, although only one percent work in the oil industry.
Early in the country's independence, experts from Singapore's Botanical Garden helped turn the island into a tropical garden city.
The orchid hybrid Vanda Miss Joaquim was named the national flower of the country in 1981.
Every year around October, nearly 1.5 million grass-eaters for the sake of rain move from the northern hills towards the southern plains and cross the Mara River.
And then back to the northern part through the western, when they again cross the Mara River, after the rains that come about in April.
The Serengeti region consists of Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania and Maasai Mara Conservation Area in Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media requires both conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools one learns in interactive classes (storyboarding, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.)
Interactive design requires you to rethink your image of what media production is and learn to think in new ways.
Interactive design requires that the components of a project are interrelated, but also understandable as separate entities.
The disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the complexity of the focal length and the number of lens elements required to achieve a focal length range are much greater than for fixed-lens lenses.
This becomes an increasingly minor problem when lens manufacturers achieve higher standards of lens production.
This has allowed zoom lenses to provide images of a quality comparable to that achieved by fixed focal length lenses.
Another disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the maximum aperture (and shutter speed) of the lens is usually lower.
This makes cheap zoom lenses difficult to use in low light without flash.
One of the most common problems when converting movies to DVD format is overscanning.
Most television sets are designed to satisfy the public.
For that reason, everything you see on TV has cut margins, top, bottom, and sides.
This is done to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. It is called overscan.
Unfortunately, the edges are also likely to be cropped when you make a DVD, and subtitles at the bottom of the image may then partially disappear.
The traditional medieval castle has long tickled the imagination and evoked images of jousting, banquets and Arthurian chivalry.
Even when standing among ruins that are thousands of years old, it is easy to imagine the sounds and smells of ancient battles, you can almost hear hooves rustling on the cobblestones and smell the fear from the dungeons.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built in the first place? How were they designed and built?
Kirby Muxloe Castle is more of a fortified house than an authentic castle, which is typical of the period.
Its large glazed windows and thin walls would not have been able to withstand a determined attack for very long.
In the 1480s, when construction was begun by Lord Hastings, the country was relatively peaceful and the defence was needed only against small wandering robber bands.
The balance of power was a system in which European nations strove to maintain the sovereignty of all European states.
The concept was that all European nations would work to prevent a nation from gaining too much power and therefore national governments often switched allegiances to maintain balance.
The War of the Spanish Succession was the first war whose central issue was the balance of power.
This marked an important change, as European powers would no longer have the pretext of religious wars. Thus, the Thirty Years' War would be the last war designated as a religious war.
The temple of Artemis at Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 B.C.E., in a fire built by Herostratus.
According to the story, his motivation was fame at all costs. The furious Ephesians announced that the name of Herostratos would never be registered.
The Greek historian Strabo later noted the name, as it is called today. The temple was destroyed on the night Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander, as king, offered to pay to rebuild the temple, but his offer was rejected. Later, after Alexander had died, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.
Make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible while still hitting all the notes correctly. Also try not to make many superfluous movements with your fingers.
This way, you tire yourself out as little as possible. Remember that there is no need to hit the keys with a lot of force for extra volume like on a piano.
With an accordion, you use the bellows with more pressure or higher speed to get higher volume.
Mysticism is the pursuit of communion with, identity with, or conscious awareness of a supreme reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God.
The believer seeks a direct experience, intuition or insight into divine reality/deity or the deities.
Adherents follow certain ways of life, or customs designed to promote these experiences.
Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious belief and worship by its emphasis on the strictly personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, especially that of a peaceful, insightful, blissful, or even ecstatic nature.
Sikhism is a religion from the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the Punjab region in the 15th century through a sectarian division within the Hindu tradition.
Sikhs believe that their faith is a religion separate from Hinduism, although they recognize its Hindu roots and traditions.
"Sikher calls his religion Gurmat, which is Punjabi for "The Way of the Guru". The Guru is fundamental in all Indian religions but for Sikhism it is so important that it forms the core of the Sikh faith."
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469 - 1539), followed by nine more gurus in succession.
But in June 1956, Khrushchev's promises were put to the test when uprisings in Poland, where workers protested against lack of food and wage cuts, turned into a general protest against communism.
Although Khrushchev ultimately sent in tanks to restore order, he gave way to certain economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister.
The Indus culture was a Bronze Age civilization on the northwestern Indian subcontinent that encompassed most of present-day Pakistan as well as some regions of northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan.
Civilization flourished in the valley of the Indus River, from which it also got its name.
Although some scholars speculate that since civilization also existed around the now-dehydrated Sarasvati River, the more aptly named Indus-Sarasvati civilization should be used, while some call it the Harappan civilization after Harappa, the first of its sites to be excavated in the 1920s.
The military character of the Roman Empire facilitated the development of medical progress.
Doctors began to be recruited by Emperor Augustus and even formed the first Roman medical corps for use after battles.
Surgeons knew of a number of sedatives, including morphine from extracts of poppy seeds and scopolamine from bulwark seeds.
They became skilled at amputation to save patients from gangrene as well as pressure dressings and arterial clamps to stop blood flow.
For several centuries, the Roman Empire had great success in the medical field and created much of the knowledge we have today.
Pureland origami is origami with the restriction that only one fold may be made at a time, more complicated folds such as backward folds are not allowed, and all folds have simple placements.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help inexperienced temps or those with limited motor skills.
Children develop an awareness of race and race-based stereotypes at a fairly early age, and these race-based stereotypes influence behavior.
For example, children who identify with a racial minority where the stereotype is that they are not doing well in school tend not to perform well in school once they find out the stereotype associated with their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States and currently has 54 million user profiles.
These sites have received a lot of attention, especially in the field of education.
There are positive aspects to these sites, such as being able to easily create a class page that can include blogs, videos, photos, and other features.
This page can be easily accessed by entering only one URL, making it easy to remember and easy to type in for students who may have trouble using the keyboard or with spelling.
It can be adapted to be more readable and with as much or as little colour as desired.
"ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) ""is a neurological syndrome whose classically defining triad of symptoms includes impulsivity, attention problems, and hyperactivity or excess energy""."
"It's not learning disabilities, but a learning disorder; it ""affects 3 to 5 percent of all children, perhaps as many as 2 million American children"".
Children with ADD have difficulty focusing on things like schoolwork, but they can concentrate on things they like such as playing games or watching their favorite cartoon shows or writing sentences without punctuation.
"These children tend to have a lot of trouble, because they ""dedicate themselves to risky behavior, get into fights, and defy authority""" to stimulate their brains, because their brains cannot be stimulated by normal methods."
ADD affects the relationship with other children because they cannot understand why they act as they do, spell as they do, or that they are at a different level of maturity.
When the ability to acquire knowledge and to learn changed in the above way, the speed at which knowledge was obtained also changed.
The approach to collecting information was different. The pressure was no longer on individual recalls, but the focus shifted more to the possibility of recalling text.
Essentially, the Renaissance meant a significant change in the approach to learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands to make their way, to carry body weight or swing through trees.
The hand and foot of the chimpanzee are about the same size, reflecting the use of the hand to carry the weight when the monkey is walking on the knuckles.
The human hand is shorter than the foot, with straighter phalanges.
Fossil hand bones that are two to three million years old reveal this change in the specialization of the hand from movement to manipulation.
Some consider it can be very exhausting to experience many induced lucid dreams too often.
The main reason behind this phenomenon is the consequence of lucid dreaming extending the time between REM states.
With fewer REM episodes per night, this condition is reached where you experience actual sleep and your body rarely recovers enough to become a problem.
This is as exhausting as if you were to wake up every 20 or 30 minutes and watch TV.
The effect depends on how many times your brain tries to cleardream per night.
Within a week of Italy's declaration of war on 10 June 1940, the British 11th Hussars had taken control of Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured the Italian Tenth Army's chief engineer, General Lastucci.
On 28 June, Marshal Italo Balbo, Governor-General of Libya and the likely successor to Mussolini, was killed by a wet shot while landing in Tobruk.
The modern fencing sport is practiced at many different levels, from university students to professional and Olympic competition.
The sport is played primarily in a duel format, one fencer duels with another.
Golf is a sport in which players use clubs to punch balls into holes.
Eighteen holes are played during a regular round where players usually start on the first hole of the course and end on the eighteenth.
The winner makes the player who needs the least number of strokes, or swings with the club, to complete the course.
The game is played on grass and the grass around the hole is cut shorter and called green.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is what most people associate with travel: recreational tourism.
This is when people go to a place that is very different from their everyday lives to relax and have fun.
Beaches, theme parks and campsites are among the most common places that tourists visit for relaxation.
If someone visits a particular place to get to know its history and culture, then that kind of tourism is called cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different attractions in a particular country or so they can simply choose to focus on just one area.
The colonists who saw this activity had also requested reinforcements.
Troops reinforcing the front lines included the 1st and 3rd Regiments from New Hampshire with 200 men, led by Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both then becoming generals).
Stark's men posted themselves along the fence at the north side of the colonists' position.
When the low tide opened a gap along the Mystic River along the northeastern part of the peninsula, they quickly built out the fence with a short stone wall towards the northern end at the water's edge on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark placed a stick approximately 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered that no one give fire until the regulars passed it.
The U.S. plan was based on coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder was to launch a rail attack against the British garrison at Bordentown in order to block any support troops.
General James Ewing would take a militia of 700 across the river at Trenton Ferry, take possession of the bridge over Assunpink Creek and prevent all enemy troops from escaping.
The main assault force of 2,400 men would cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and then split into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, to launch an attack before dawn.
With the change from a quarter to half an English mile running, speed becomes much less important and endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, a first-class runner at the distance half a mile, a man who can manage it in under two minutes, will have to cope with quite a lot of speed. But perseverance must be taken into account at all costs.
Some off-road running during the winter, combined with upper body strength training, is the best preparation for the running season.
Proper nutrition habits alone cannot generate elite performance, but they can significantly affect the overall well-being of young athletes.
A healthy energy balance, effective hydration habits and knowledge of the different aspects of nutritional supplements can help athletes improve their performance and gain increased enjoyment from their sport.
Mid-distance running is a relatively inexpensive sport, however, there are many misconceptions regarding the small amount of equipment required to participate.
Equipment can be purchased if needed, but most products have little or no impact on performance.
Although it does not provide any actual benefits, athletes may find that they enjoy a product more.
The atom can be seen as one of the fundamental building blocks of all matter.
It is a very complex device that, according to a simplified Bohr model, consists of a central core surrounded by electrons, somewhat similar to planets orbiting the sun - see Figure 1.1.
The nucleus consists of two particles - neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electrical charge while neutrons have no charge. The electrons have a negative electrical charge.
Before examining the victim, you must first check the surroundings to ensure your own safety.
You must note the victim's position as you approach him or her and any automatic red flags.
If you hurt yourself when you try to help, you’re only making things worse.
The study found that depression, fear, and catastrophizing were an indirect causal link between pain and disability in individuals suffering from lower back pain.
They only addressed the effects of black painting in the weekly meetings, not the effects of depression and of fear.
Those who participated in regular activity required more support in terms of negative experience of pain, which characterized the differences between chronic pain and discomfort from normal physical movement.
Vision, or the ability to see, depends on the sensory organ or eyes of the visual system.
Eyes are constructed in many different ways, with different complexity depending on what the organism requires.
The different designs have different capacities, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have varying levels of sharpness. They also require different processing methods to interpret the input and different numbers to function optimally.
A population is a collection of organisms within a particular species within a particular geographical area.
When all individuals in a population are identical with respect to a particular phenotypic trait, they are called monomorphic.
When individuals exhibit multiple variants of a specific trait, they are called polymorphic.
Colonies of wandering ants march and build nests in different phases as well.
In the nomadic phase, the migratory ants march at night and stop to camp during the day.
The colony enters a nomadic phase when available food decreases. During this phase, the colony creates temporary nests that are changed every day.
Each of these nomadic rampages or marches lasts about 17 days.
"What is a cell? The word cell comes from the Latin word ""cella"", which means ""small room"", and it was originally coined by a microscopist who observed the structure of cork."
The cell is the base unit of all living things, and all organisms consist of one or more cells.
Cells are so fundamental and critical to the study of life that they are actually often called the “building blocks of life.”
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses throughout the body to keep blood flow going without interference.
These nerve impulses can be sent so quickly throughout the body, which helps keep it safe from possible threats.
Thrombae affect a small area compared to other violent storms, but they can destroy everything in their path.
Tornadoes uproot trees, tear boards from buildings, and throw cars into the sky. The most violent two percent of tornadoes last longer than three hours.
These monster storms have winds of up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 miles/h).
Humans have been making and using magnifying lenses for thousands of years.
However, the first real telescopes were created in Europe in the late 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects appear both closer and larger.
Greed and selfishness will always be with us, and it is the nature of cooperation that when the majority benefits, there is always more to gain in the short term by acting selfishly.
In the long run, most people will hopefully realize that their best option is to work with others.
Many people dream of the day when people can travel to another star and explore other worlds, some people marvel at what is out there, some people think that aliens or other life can live on another planet.
"But if this ever happens, it probably won't happen for a very long time. The stars are so scattered that there are trillions of kilometers between stars that are ""neighbors""."
Maybe one day your grandchildren’s children will look out over a strange world and think about their ancient ancestors?
Animals are made up of many cells. They eat things and digest the food inside. Most animals can move.
Only animals have a brain (but not even all animals; jellyfish, for example, have no brain).
There are animals all over the earth, digging in the ground, swimming in the sea, and flying in the air.
A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of any living (object) organism.
The word cell is derived from the Latin cella which means small room.
If you look at living creatures in a microscope, you will see that they are made of small squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, saw small squares in cork with a microscope.
They looked like space. He was the first human to observe dead cells
Elements and chemical compounds can shift from one state to another without changing.
Nitrogen in gaseous form still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is more compact but it is still the same molecules.
Water is another example. The compound water consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure whether it is gas, liquid or solid.
Although its physical state may change, its chemical state remains the same.
Time is everywhere around us, affecting everything we do, yet it’s hard to understand.
Time has been studied by religious, philosophical and scientific scholars for thousands of years.
We experience time as a series of events running from the future, through the present, to the past.
Time is also how we compare the duration (length) of occasions.
You can measure the passage of time yourself by observing the repetition of a cyclic event. A cyclic event is something that happens regularly over and over again.
Today, computers are used to edit images and videos.
Sophisticated animations can be created on computers, and these types of animations are increasingly used in television and film.
Music is often recorded with sophisticated computers that process and mix sounds.
Long during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, it was believed that New Zealand's first inhabitants were the Maori people, who hunted giant birds called moaf birds.
The theory then established the idea that the Maori people migrated from Polynesia in a large fleet and took New Zealand from Moriori where they established an agricultural community.
However, new evidence suggests that the Moriori were a group of Maoris from the mainland who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, developing their own distinctive, peaceful culture.
There was also another tribe in the Chatham Islands and these were Maori who moved from New Zealand.
They called themselves Moriori, there were some minor clashes and in the end Moriori was exterminated.
People who have been involved for decades helped us appreciate our strengths and passions while openly assessing difficulties and even failures.
By listening to individuals' personal stories about themselves, their family and their organization, we have gained valuable insights about the local history and about the people who have affected the organization's culture positively or negatively.
Although knowledge of one's history is not the same as cultural insight, at least it gives people a sense of where they belong within the history of the organization.
As individuals and participants as a whole assess their success and become aware of failures, they and all other participants discover the organization’s values, mission, and driving forces at a deeper level.
In this case, it was helpful to remember past entrepreneurship and the successes that followed, in order for people to be open to change and a new direction for the local church.
Such success stories reduced the fear of change, while providing a positive attitude towards future change.
Convergent thinking is problem-solving techniques that unite different ideas or areas to find a solution.
This mindset focuses on speed, logic, and accuracy, as well as identifying facts, reapplying existing techniques, and gathering information.
The most important factor in this way of thinking is: there is only one correct answer. One thinks only of two answers, namely right or wrong.
This mindset is associated with certain knowledge or standard practices.
People with this way of thinking have a logical thinking, are able to memorize patterns, solve problems and work on scientific investigations.
Humans are superior to other species in reading the thoughts of others.
This means that we are capable of anticipating what other people experience, intend, believe, know or desire.
Among these abilities, it is important to understand the intent of others. This allows us to determine any ambiguities in physical actions.
For example, if you see someone smashing a car window, you probably take it for granted that they are trying to steal a car that belongs to someone else.
He would have to be judged differently if he had lost his car keys and it was his own car he was trying to break into.
MRI is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) that was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (Harvard University).
In this resonance, magnetic fields and radio waves cause atoms to emit small radio signals.
In 1970, physician and researcher Raymond Damadian discovered the basis for using magnetic resonance imaging as a tool for medical diagnosis.
Four years later, a patent was granted, which was the first patent in the world to be issued within MRI.
"In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first ""whole-body"" MR camera, which he called ""Indomitable""."
Asynchronous communication encourages time for reflection and reaction towards others.
It gives students the opportunity to work at their own pace and control the speed of the instructing information.
In addition, there are fewer time restrictions on the possibility of flexible working hours. (Bremer, 1998)
The use of the internet and www means that students have access to information at all times.
Students can also submit questions to tutors at any time of the day and expect reasonably quick answers, instead of waiting until the next in-person meeting.
The postmodern educational orientation offers freedom from absolute solutions. There is not a perfect learning method.
There is actually not a good thing to learn. Learning takes place in the experience between the student and the presented knowledge.
Our current experience with all do-it-yourself and information-presenting, learning-based TV shows illustrates this point.
Many people watch a television program that informs us of a process or experience that we will never participate in or apply the acquired knowledge.
We will never examine a car, build a fountain in our backyard, travel to Peru to examine ancient ruins, or rebuild the neighbor’s house.
Thanks to underwater fibre-optic cable links to Europe and broadband satellite, Greenland is well connected, with 93% of the population having access to the internet.
The hotel or hosts (if you live in a guest house or a private home) probably have wifi or a PC connected to the internet and all settlements have an internet cafe or some place with public wifi.
“As mentioned above, although the word ‘Eskimo’ remains acceptable in the United States, it is considered derogatory by many non-U.S. Arctic peoples, particularly in Canada.”
Although you may hear the word used by native Greenlanders, foreigners should avoid using it.
The indigenous people of Greenland call themselves Inuit in Canada and Kalaalleq (plural Kalaallit), Greenlanders, in Greenland.
"Crime, and hostility towards foreigners in general, practically does not exist in Greenland. Nor are there any ""rugged neighborhoods"" in the cities. "
Cold weather is perhaps the only real danger faced by the unprepared.
If you are visiting Greenland during the cold season (given that it gets colder the further north you go), it is important to bring enough warm clothes.
The very long days of summer can lead to problems getting enough sleep and associated health problems.
During the summer, also watch out for the Nordic mosquitoes. Although they do not spread any diseases, they can be annoying.
Although San Francisco's economy is linked to its status as a world-class tourist attraction, the economy is diverse.
The largest labour market sectors are professional services, government, finance, trade and tourism.
Its frequent portrayals in music, films, literature, and popular culture have helped make the city and its landmarks known worldwide.
San Francisco has developed an extensive tourism infrastructure with plenty of hotels, restaurants, and first-class venues for gatherings.
San Francisco is also one of the country’s best places for other Asian cuisines: Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese.
A trip to Walt Disney World is an important pilgrimage for many American families.
"The ""typical""" visit involves flying to Orlando International Airport, taking a bus to a Disney hotel on site, spending about a week without leaving Disney's area, and returning home."
"There are an infinite number of variations, but this is what most people mean when they talk about going to Disney World."
Many tickets sold online on auction sites such as eBay or Craigslist are partially used park-hopper tickets for several days.
Although it is very common, Disney prohibits it: the tickets may not be transferred.
Every campsite under the rim of the Grand Canyon requires a so-called outback permit.
The permits are limited to protect the canyon, and are released on the first day of the month, four months before the starting month.
Thus, a wilderness permit with an optional start date during the month of May will be available on 1 January.
The location on the most popular areas, such as the Bright Angel Campground next to the Phantom Ranch, is usually filled by requests received the first day they open for reservation.
There are a limited number of permits reserved for those requesting to enter on foot, available on a first come, first served basis.
Getting into southern Africa by car is a great way to see the beauty of the whole area and get to places beyond the usual tourist routes.
This can be done with a normal car with careful planning but four-wheel drive is highly recommended and many places can only be reached with a car with four-wheel drive and high wheelbase.
Remember when you plan that although South Africa is stable, not all of its neighboring countries are.
The requirements and costs of a visa vary from country to country and are affected by which country you come from.
Each country also has unique laws that set requirements on what devices must be in the car for emergencies.
The city of Victoria falls is located in western Zimbabwe, on the other side of the border with Livingstone, Zambia and near Botswana.
The city is located right next to the waterfalls, and these are the main attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers enough opportunities for longer stays for both adventure seekers and those who are sightseeing.
During the rainy season (November to March), the water volume is larger and the falls become more dramatic.
You are guaranteed to get wet if you cross the bridge or walk along the tracks that meander close to the falls.
On the other hand, it’s precisely because the water masses are so huge that your view of the actual Niagara Falls is obscured – by all the water!
KV62 is perhaps the most famous of the tombs in the valley, the site of Howard Carter's discovery of the almost intact royal burial of the young king in 1922.
Compared to most of the other royal tombs, Tutankhamun's tomb is hardly worth visiting, as it is much smaller and has limited decoration.
Anyone who wants to see evidence of the damage caused to the mummy when attempting to move it from the coffin will be disappointed because only the head and shoulders are visible.
The outstanding treasures of the tomb are no longer there, but have been moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Visitors with short if time do best in spending time somewhere else.
Phnum kram, 12 km southwest of Siem reap. This temple at the top of the hill was built in the late 9th century, under King Yasovarman.
The temple’s eerie atmosphere and views of Lake Tonle Sap make the climb to the hill worth the effort.
A visit to the site can easily be combined with a boat trip on the lake.
The Angkor pass is needed to enter the temple, so don’t forget to bring your pass when you make your way to Tonle sap.
Jerusalem is Israel's capital and largest city, although most countries and the United Nations do not recognize Israel's capital.
The ancient city of Judea has a fascinating history stretching back thousands of years.
The city is sacred to three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and serves as a spiritual, religious, and cultural center.
Jerusalem is one of the most important tourist destinations in Israel because of its religious importance, and especially because of the many places in the Old Town.
Jerusalem has many historical, archaeological and cultural sites, along with bustling and crowded shopping centers, cafes and restaurants.
Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to receive an invitation before arriving in Ecuador via international airports or border crossings.
This letter must be approved by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and meet specific requirements.
These requirements are designed to create a regulated flow of migration between the two countries.
Cuban citizens who have a U.S. green card should turn to an Ecuadorian consulate for an exemption from this requirement.
Your passport must be valid at least six months after your travel dates. A return or onward travel ticket is needed to prove how long you should stay.
The tours are cheaper for larger groups, so whether you’re alone or just with a friend, try meeting other people and form a group of four to six for a cheaper price per person.
However, it is not something that you should worry about, as tourists are often moved around to fill the cars.
In fact, it seems rather like a way of tricking people into thinking they have to pay more.
Above the northern part of Machu Picchu rises this steep mountain, which is often seen in the background of many photos of the ruins.
It looks a bit daunting from below, and it’s a steep and difficult climb, with most people who are in reasonably good condition should be able to do it in around 45 minutes.
Stone stairs are laid along most of the path and in the steeper sections steel cables are used as railings.
So you can expect to get short of breath, and take it easy in the steeper parts, especially when it’s wet, as it can quickly become dangerous.
Near the top there is a small cavity that you have to pass, it is quite low and crowded to squeeze through.
The sites and wildlife of the Galápagos Islands are best seen by boat, just as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships sail the Galapagos – with varying sizes of between 8 and 100 passengers.
Most people book their seats far in advance (because the boats are often full in high season).
Make sure you book through a travel agency that specializes in Galapagos, with a good knowledge of many different types of ships.
This will ensure that your particular interests and/or limitations are matched with the ship that best suits them.
Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was under Inca rule while the indigenous Araucans (Mapuche) inhabited the central and southern parts of Chile.
Mapuche was also one of the last independent groups of Native Americans, who were not fully absorbed into Spanish-speaking rule until after Chile's independence.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (in the midst of the Napoleonic War that left Spain without a functioning central government for a few years), the decisive victory over the Spanish was only achieved in 1818.
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominicana) is a Caribbean country that extends to the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti.
In addition to white sandy beaches and mountain scenery, the country is also home to the oldest European city in America, today part of Santo Domingo.
The island was inhabited from the beginning by the Tainos and the Caribs. The Caribs were a people who spoke Arawak and who arrived on the island around 10,000 B.C.E.
Within a few years of the arrival of European explorers, the number of Taino had been greatly reduced by the Spanish conquerors.
Based on Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias), the Spanish conquerors killed about 100,000 Taínos between 1492 and 1498.
Jardín de la Unión. This space was built as the atrium for a 17th-century monastery, of which the Templo de San Diego is the only surviving building.
It now serves as a central square and there are always things happening, day and night.
There are a number of restaurants surrounding the garden and in the afternoons and evenings, free concerts are often given from the gazebo in the middle.
Callejon del Beso (Alley of the Kiss). Two balconies separated by only 69 centimeters are home to an old love legend.
Some kids can tell you the story for a few bucks.
Bowen Island is a popular day trip or weekend getaway that offers canoeing, hiking, shops, restaurants and more.
This authentic community is located in Howe Sound just outside Vancouver and is easily reached by water taxi according to schedule, departing from Granville Island in downtown Vancouver.
For those who like outdoor activities, it is a must to hike The sea-to-sky corridor.
Whistler (1.5-hour drive from Vancouver) is expensive, but well-known due to the 2010 Winter Olympics.
Wintertime, enjoy among the best skiing in North America, and summertime try true mountain biking.
Permits must be booked in advance. You must have a permit to stay overnight at Sirena.
Sirena is the only park ranger station that, in addition to camping, offers overnight accommodation in dormitory and hot meals. La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos only offer camping without dining.
It is possible to secure park permits directly from the park guard station in Puerto Jiménez, but they do not accept credit cards
The Park Service (MINAE) does not issue a parking permit more than one month before the expected arrival.
CafeNet El Sol offers a booking service for a fee of $30, or $10 for a one-day pass; more information can be found on their Corcovado page.
The Cook Islands are an island country freely associated with New Zealand, located in Polynesia, in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean.
It is an archipelago of 15 islands that spreads over 2.2 million square kilometers of sea.
"With the same time zone as Hawaii, sometimes the islands are called ""Hawaii down under""."
Although smaller, it reminds some older visitors of Hawaii before statehood without all the major tourist hotels and other developments.
The Cook Islands have no cities, but consist of 15 different islands. The largest are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
Offering luxurious bed & breakfasts has today been elevated to a kind of art form in developed countries.
Of course, in the upper price range, hostels mainly compete with two important things: beds and breakfast.
Consequently, at the finest of such facilities one can probably find the most luxurious bedding, perhaps a handmade quilt or an antique bed.
The breakfast may include seasonal delights from the region or the host's speciality.
The place can be a historic old building with antique furniture, well-kept plot and a swimming pool.
Getting into your own car and going off on a long journey has an inherent allure in its simplicity.
Unlike larger vehicles, you’re probably already used to driving your car and know its limitations.
Pitching tents on private land or in cities of all sizes can easily attract unwanted attention.
In conclusion, owning a car is a very good way to travel around, but that in itself does not mean the same thing as camping.
Camping by car is possible if you have a minibus, SUV, sedan or manor trailer with seats that can be folded down.
Some hotels date back to the golden era of steam railways and ocean steamers; before World War II, in the 19th century or early 20th century.
It was at these hotels the rich and the famous lived at the time, and often had great dinners and nightlife.
The old-fashioned fittings, the lack of the latest amenities, and a particularly elegant old age are also part of their character.
As they are usually privately owned, they sometimes accommodate visiting heads of state and other dignitaries.
A wealthy traveler might consider a round-the-world trip with breaks at many of these hotels.
A hospitality network is an organization that facilitates contact between travelers and residents of the cities they will be visiting.
Joining such a network usually only requires completing an online form; although some networks offer or require additional verification.
Then, a list of available hosts is provided, either in print and/or online, sometimes with references and reviews from other travelers.
Couchsurfing was founded in January 2004 after programmer Casey Fenton found a cheap flight to Iceland, but had nowhere to stay.
He emailed students at the local university and received an overwhelming number of offers of free accommodation.
Hostels are primarily aimed at young people – a typical guest is in their 20s – but you can often find older travelers there as well.
Families with children are an unusual sight, but at some hostels they have the option of staying in private rooms.
The city of Beijing in China will host the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics.
Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and the ice branches.
Other ski events take place in the Taizicheng ski area of Zhangjiakou, located about 220 km from Beijing.
Most temples have an annual festival starting from late November to mid-May, which varies depending on each temple's annual calendar.
Most temple festivals are celebrated as part of the temple anniversary or present divinity birthday or any other major event associated with the temple.
Kerala's temple festivals are very interesting to see, with regular processions of decorated elephants, temple orchestras and other festivities.
A World Exhibition (also called the World Exposition or simply Expo) is a major international festival of arts and sciences.
Participating countries present artistic and educational exhibits in national pavilions to showcase issues relating to the world or their country's culture and history.
International gardening exhibitions are specialized events that showcase flowers, botanical gardens, and everything else related to plants.
Although in theory they can be organised annually (as long as they are in different countries), in practice this does not happen.
These events typically last anywhere between three and six months and are held in locations that are at least 50 acres in size.
There are many different film formats used over the years. Regular 35 mm film (36 by 24 mm negative) is the most prevalent.
It can usually be refilled quite easily if it runs out and provides a resolution similar to that of a modern SLR camera.
Some medium format film cameras use a format of 6 by 6 cm, more specifically a negative by 56 by 56 mm.
This provides almost four times better resolution than a 35 mm negative (3,136 mm2 versus 864).
Wild animals are among the most challenging subjects for a photographer and require a combination of luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
Game photography is often taken for granted, but just like photography in general, a picture is worth a thousand words.
Photographing wild animals often requires a long telephoto lens, but things like a flock of birds or a small animal need other lenses.
Many exotic animals are hard to find, and parks sometimes have rules surrounding photography for commercial purposes.
Wild animals can be either timid or aggressive. The environment can be chilly, hot, or otherwise inhospitable.
Worldwide, more than 5,000 languages are spoken, of which more than twenty are spoken by 50 million people or more.
Moreover, written words are often easier to understand than spoken words. This is especially true for addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce in an intelligible way.
In many whole nations you are completely fluent in English and in even more you can expect limited knowledge - especially among younger people.
Imagine a Manchester resident, a Boston resident, a Jamaican and a Sydney resident sitting at a table having dinner at a Toronto restaurant.
They entertain each other with stories from their hometowns, told in their distinctive dialects and local slang.
Buying food in supermarkets is usually the cheapest way to eat. However, without cooking options, the choices are limited to ready-made food.
Grocery stores are expanding their range of ready-made foods, some even having a microwave or something similar so that you can heat the food.
In some countries or types of shops there is at least one restaurant on site, often a rather informal one with affordable prices.
Make copies of your policy and your insurance company’s contact information and carry them with you.
In order to receive advice/authorizations or make a claim, they must present the insurance company's email address and international phone number.
"Have an extra copy in your luggage and online (email yourself as an attachment, or save in the "cloud"")."
If you are traveling with a laptop or tablet, make sure to store a copy on its memory or hard drive (accessible without internet).
Also provide copies of policy documents/contact details to travel companions and relatives and friends at home who are willing to help.
Moose are not normally aggressive but defend themselves if they experience a threat.
When people don’t see moose as potentially dangerous, they can get too close and put themselves in danger.
Consume alcoholic beverages in moderation. Alcohol affects everyone differently, and it is important to know its limit.
Prolonged health problems that can arise from too much drinking include liver diseases and even blindness and death. The potential danger increases with the consumption of illegally made alcohol.
Illegal spirits can contain various dangerous contaminants such as methanol, which even in small doses can cause blindness or death.
Glasses can be cheaper abroad, especially in high-income countries where labor costs are lower.
Consider examining your eyes at home, especially if the insurance covers it, and bring your prescription to have it filed elsewhere.
Exclusive brand frames available in such areas may have two problems; some may be plagiarism and the genuine ones imported may be more expensive than at home.
Coffee is one of the world’s most traded commodities and you can probably find many types in your home region.
Nevertheless, there are many special ways to drink coffee around the world that are worth experiencing.
Canyoning is about being at the bottom of a canyon, which is either dry or full of water.
Canyoning combines parts from swimming, climbing and jumping - but requires relatively little exercise or good physical fitness to get started (compared to e.g. rock climbing, diving or alpine skiing).
Hiking is an outdoor activity that involves hiking in nature, often along hiking trails.
Day hikes include distances of less than a mile up to longer distances that can be completed in a single day.
For a day trip along an easy trail, not much preparation is needed and any average fit person can enjoy them.
Families with toddlers may need to prepare more, but a day outdoors is easy to implement even with toddlers and preschoolers.
Internationally, there are almost 200 organizations for running. Most operate independently.
"Global Running Tours successor, Go Running Tours, connects dozens of providers of so-called ""sightrunning"" on four continents."
"With roots in Barcelona's ""Running Tours Barcelona"" and Copenhagen's ""Running Copenhagen"", it was quickly expanded with ""Running Tours Prague"" based in Prague and other cities."
There are many things that you need to consider before and during your trip.
"When you travel, don't expect things to be like ""there at home"". Behavior, laws, food, traffic, accommodation, norms, language and so on will differ in some way from where you live."
This is something you always need to keep in mind to avoid disappointment or maybe even disgust over local habits.
Travel agencies have been around since the 1800s. A travel agency is usually a good choice for a trip that goes beyond a traveler's previous experience of nature, culture, language or low-income countries.
Although many agencies are willing to take on most regular bookings, many agencies specialize in particular types of travel, budget intervals, or destinations.
It may be better to use an agency that often books similar trips to yours.
Take a look at what travel agent markets, whether they are on a website or in a storefront.
If you want to see the world in a cheap way, either as a necessity, lifestyle or challenge, then there are many ways to do it.
Basically, they can be divided into two categories: Either you work while traveling, or you try to limit your expenses. This article is focused on the latter.
"For those who would like to sacrifice convenience, time and predictability to reduce spending to basically zero, see ""travel on a minimal budget""."
The advice assumes that travellers do not steal, infringe, participate in the illegal market, beg or otherwise exploit other people for their own profit.
The border control is usually the first stop after disembarking from a plane, boat or other vehicle.
On some trains that cross borders, checks are made while the train is in motion, and then you should have a valid ID when you get on.
On night trains, passes can be collected by the conductor so you don’t have to have your sleep interrupted.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you must register your presence and the address where you live with the local authorities.
This may require a form to be filled in with the local police or a visit to the immigration office.
In many countries with such a law, local hotels handle the registration (make sure to ask).
In other cases, you only need to register if you rent rooms that are outside of tourist accommodation. But this makes the law much more obscure, so find out how it is in advance.
Architecture is about the design and construction of buildings. The architecture of a place is often a tourist attraction in itself.
Many buildings are quite beautiful to look at and the view from a tall building or a smartly placed window can be a very beautiful sight.
Architecture significantly overlaps other areas, including urban planning, road and water construction, decorative arts, interior and landscape design.
Many villages are far away, so there is no real nightlife unless you go to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, almost all of the aforementioned casinos serve drinks and several of them also bring in famous names such as entertainment (mainly large ones from Albuquerque’s and Santa Fe’s immediate surroundings).
Beware: small-town bars here are not always good places to hang out for visitors from outside.
First, northern New Mexico has significant problems with drunk driving, and the concentration of drunk drivers is high near bars in small towns.
Unwanted murals or doodles are called graffiti.
Although it is far from a modern phenomenon, most people probably associate it with youth who vandalize public and private property with spray paint.
"However, nowadays there are established graffiti artists, graffiti elements and ""legal"" walls. In these contexts, the graffiti paintings often resemble artwork rather than unreadable tags."
Boomerang throwing is a popular skill that many tourists want to learn.
If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang that comes back to your hand, make sure you have a good boomerang that returns.
Most boomerangs in Australia do not actually return. As a beginner, it is best not to throw in windy
Hangi-made food is cooked in a warm pit in the field.
The pit is heated either by hot stones from a fire or by the geothermal heat that in some places heats the ground naturally.
Hangin is often used to cook a traditional kind of barbecue dinner.
Several locations in Rotorua offer geothermal hangi, while other types of hangi are available to taste in Christchurch and Wellington, among others.
MetroRail has two classes of commuter trains in and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also known as first class) and Metro (known as third class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and not so crowded, but a little more expensive, but still cheaper than regular metro tickets in Europe.
Each train has both MetroPlus and Metro carriages; the MetroPlus carriages are always at the end of the train closest to Cape Town.
Carrying for others - Never leave your bags out of sight, especially when crossing international borders.
You may end up being used as a drug carrier without your knowledge, which can get you into a lot of trouble.
This includes waiting in a row, as drug dogs can be used at any time without warning.
Some countries have very harsh penalties even for first-time offenders, these may include prison sentences of more than ten years or the death penalty.
Baggage left unattended is a target for thieves and may also be brought to the attention of authorities concerned about bomb threats.
If you are at home, the odds are very high that you are already immune to them due to constant exposure to the local bacteria.
But in other parts of the world, where the bacteriological fauna is new to you, you are much more likely to encounter problems.
In warmer climates, bacteria can both grow faster and survive longer outside the body.
Thus the plagues of Delhi-mage, Pharaoh's curse, Montezuma's revenge and their many friends.
As with respiratory problems in colder climates, intestinal problems in warmer climates are quite common and in most cases noticeably irritating, but not directly dangerous.
If you’re traveling in a developing country for the first time – or in a new part of the world – don’t underestimate the potential culture shock.
Many seasoned travelers have become enthralled with the novelty of travel in developing countries, where many small cultural adjustments can quickly turn into an advantage.
Consider, especially during your first days, hitting the big with hotels, food and service with Western style and quality, to more easily acclimatize you.
Do not sleep on a mattress or cushion on the ground in areas where you do not know the local wildlife.
If you want to camp outside, bring a cot or hammock to stay away from snakes, scorpions and the like.
Fill your home with tasty coffee in the morning and some soothing chamomile tea in the evening.
When you’re at home, you have time to take care of yourself and take a few extra minutes to brew up something special.
If you feel more adventurous, you can take the opportunity to squeeze juice or mix smoothies:
Maybe you’ll discover a simple drink that you can make for breakfast when you’re back in your daily routine.
If you live in a city with a rich drinking culture, go to bars or pubs in neighborhoods you don’t visit often.
For those unfamiliar with medical jargon, the words infectious and contagious have different meanings.
An infectious disease is a disease caused by a pathogen, such as a virus, a bacterium, a fungus, or other parasites.
An infectious disease is a disease that is easily transmitted by being close to an infected person.
Many governments require that incoming visitors or expatriate residents of their countries be vaccinated for a variety of diseases.
These requirements can often differ depending on which countries a traveller has visited or intends to visit.
One of the strong things about Charlotte, North Carolina, is that it has an abundance of high-quality options for families.
Residents who have moved in from other areas often cite the area’s family-friendliness as the main reason for moving there, and visitors often find the city easy to enjoy with children.
Over the past 20 years, the number of child-friendly choices in Charlotte’s north central areas has grown exponentially.
Taxis are usually not used by families in Charlotte, although they may come into use under certain circumstances.
There is a charge for more than 2 passengers, so this option may be more expensive than necessary.
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth and surrounds the South Pole.
Tourist visits are expensive, require physical health, can only take place in the summer of Nov-Feb and are mostly limited to the peninsula, the islands and the Ross Sea.
A few thousand employees live here in the summer on about four dozen bases, especially in those areas; a small number stay over the winter.
The Antarctic inland is a desolate plateau covered by 2-3 km of thick ice.
Individual specialist tours travel inland via the air for rock climbing or to reach the pole where there is a large base.
The South Pole Traverse is a 1,600 km long road from McMurdo Station on the Ross Sea to the South Pole.
It is compressed snow with cracks, filled and marked with flags. You can only travel there with special tractors, trailers with fuels and supplies.
These are not very good so the trail has to take a long turn around the trans-Antarctic mountains to get up on the plateau.
The most common cause of accidents in winter is slippery roads, sidewalks and especially steps.
As a minimum, you will need shoes with appropriate soles. Summer shoes rarely grip ice and snow well enough; even some winter shoes may be deficient.
The pattern should be deep enough, 5 mm (1/5 inch) or more, and the material sufficiently soft in cold temperatures.
Some boots have studs and there are additional equipment with studs in slippery conditions, suitable for most shoes and boots, for the heels or heels and sole.
Heels should be both low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) is often used to improve road grip by spreading it out on roads or trails.
Avalanches are not abnormal; steep slopes can only hold a certain amount of snow and the excess will fall down like avalanches.
The problem is that snow is sticky so some trigger is needed for it to come down, and snow coming down can itself become a trigger for the rest.
Sometimes the initial triggering event is that the sun warms the snow, sometimes more snowfall, sometimes other natural events, often a human.
A tornado is a spinning pillar with very low air pressure that sucks the surrounding air inwards and upwards.
They generate high winds (often 160-320 km/h) and can lift heavy objects into the air and move them as the tornado moves.
"They begin as funnels that descend from storm clouds and become "tornados" when they come down to the ground."
A connection to a Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a great way to bypass both political censorship and commercial IP geofiltration.
They are superior to web proxy servers for several reasons: They redirect all internet traffic, not just http.
They usually offer a higher bandwidth and higher quality of service. They are encrypted and therefore more difficult to spy on.
"The media companies routinely lie about the purpose of this, claiming it is to ""prevent piracy"""
In fact, region codes have no effect whatsoever on illegal copying; a bit-by-bit copy of a disc works perfectly well on any device on which the original can be played.
The actual purpose is to give these companies more control over their markets; it’s about getting the money rolling.
Because the calls are connected over the internet, you do not need to use a telecommunications company where you live or where you travel.
There is also no requirement for you to obtain a local number from the community where you live; you can get an internet connection via satellite in the wasteland of Chicken, Alaska and choose a number that claims you are in sunny Arizona.
You can often buy a global number separately that allows PSTN phones to reach you. Where the number is from matters to people who call you.
Real-time text translation apps - applications that can automatically translate entire text segments from one language to another.
Some applications in this category can even translate text in foreign languages on signs or other objects in real life when the user directs their smartphone towards these objects.
The translation engines have improved considerably, and nowadays often provide more or less accurate translations (and more rarely nonsense), but some caution is needed, as they may still have understood the text completely wrongly.
One of the most prominent apps in this category is Google Translate, which allows offline translation after downloading data for the desired languages.
Using GPS navigation apps on your smartphone can be the easiest and most convenient way to navigate when you are abroad.
It can be cheaper than buying new maps for a GPS, or a standalone GPS device, or renting one from a car rental company.
If you don’t have data connectivity on your phone, or if it’s without coverage, their performance may be limited or unavailable.
Every corner store is filled with a confusing collection of prepaid phone cards that can be used in phone booths or regular phones.
While most cards can be used to call anywhere, some specialize in providing advantageous call rates to a particular group of countries.
Access to these services is often through a toll-free number you can call from most phones at no cost.
The rules that apply to ordinary photography also apply to video recording, perhaps even to an even greater extent.
If it is forbidden to just photograph something, then you should not even think about filming it.
If you are using a drone, check thoroughly in advance what is allowed to film and what permits are required.
Flying with a drone near an airport or over a crowd is almost always a bad idea, even if it’s not illegal where you live.
Nowadays, flights are only rarely booked directly through the airline without first searching and comparing prices.
Sometimes the price of the same flight can differ enormously from different booking sites and it pays to compare search results and to look at the airline's website before booking.
You do not need a visa for short-term travel to certain countries as a tourist or business traveler, but if you are going to study, you will probably stay in the country longer than if you are a tourist.
If you are staying in a foreign country for a long time, you generally need to obtain a visa in advance.
Student visas generally have different requirements and application procedures than regular tourist or business visas.
In most countries, you will need an invitation from the institution where you want to study, and also proof that you can support yourself financially for at least the first year of your course.
Check with the department, as well as the immigration department of the country you want to study in for detailed requirements.
Unless you are a diplomat, working abroad usually means that you must declare income tax in the country where you work.
Income tax is structured differently in different countries, and tax rates and tax classes vary widely from one country to another.
In some federal countries, such as the United States and Canada, income taxes are levied both at the federal level and at the local level, so rates and classes may vary from region to region.
Although entry checks are usually missing or a formality when you enter your home country, customs checks can be difficult.
Make sure you know what you may and may not bring with you, and clear everything across the legal boundaries.
The easiest way to get started working as a travel writer is to hone your talents on an established travel blog site.
Once you are comfortable formatting and editing the web, you can later create your own web page.
Volunteering while traveling is a great way to make a difference, but it’s not just about giving.
Living and volunteering in a foreign country is a very good way to get to know a different culture, meet new people, learn more about yourself, get a sense of perspective and even acquire new skills.
It can also be a great way to stretch a budget to allow for a longer stay somewhere because many volunteer jobs offer board and lodging and a few pay a small salary.
Vikings used the Russian waterways to reach the Black and Caspian Seas. Parts of these routes are still usable. Check for special permits that may be difficult to obtain.
The White Sea-Baltic Sea Canal connects the Arctic Ocean with the Baltic Sea via Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and Saint Petersburg, mainly via rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to the Volga River, so it is still possible to get through Russia from the Caspian Sea.
You can rest assured that once you arrive at the marina, everything will be quite obvious. You will meet other boaters who share their information with you.
You will basically set up grants where you offer your help, walk around on the quays, talk to people who clean their yachts, try to connect with sailors at the bar, etcetera.
Try to talk to as many people as possible. After a while, everyone will know you and give you tips on which boat is looking for someone.
You should carefully choose your frequent flyer airline in an alliance.
While you may think it’s intuitive to become a member of the airline you fly with the most, you should be aware that the benefits are often different and the bonus points can be more generous with another airline in the same alliance.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have expanded their services to Africa significantly, offering connections to many major African cities at prices that are more competitive than other European airlines.
In 2014, Turkish Airlines flew to 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have additional travel time, check how your total travel price to Africa compares to a round the world fare.
Don’t forget to include additional costs for additional visas, departure taxes, ground transportation, etc. for all of the locations outside of Africa.
If you want to fly around the world completely in the southern hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is limited due to the lack of transoceanic routes.
No airline alliance operates all three ocean crossings in the Southern Hemisphere (and SkyTeam does not operate any of the crossings).
However, Star Alliance covers everything except the eastern South Seas from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is a LATAM Oneworld flight.
This is not the only flight option if you want to skip the southern Pacific and western coast of South America.
In 1994, the ethnically Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan waged war against the Azerbaijanis.
With Armenian support, a new republic was created. However, no established nation recognizes it - not even Armenia.
Diplomatic arguments over the region continue to cloud relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The Canal District (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is the famous 17th-century district surrounding Binnenstad in Amsterdam.
The entire area is designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unique cultural and historical value, and its property values are among the highest in the country.
Cinque Terre, which means the five countries, consists of the five small coastal villages of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso and is located in the Italian region of Liguria.
They are on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Over the centuries, people have carefully built terraces in the rugged, steep landscape right up to the cliffs that protrude out over the sea.
Part of its charm is the lack of visible business development. Paths, trains and boats connect the villages and cars do not reach them from outside.
The varieties of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland are a little different than the French spoken in France, but they are just as enough for one to understand each other.
Especially in the numbering system in the French-speaking parts of Belgium and Switzerland there are some small peculiarities that differ from the French spoken in France, and the pronunciation of some words is slightly different.
In any case, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss should learn standard French in school, so they would understand you even if you used the French standard system of numbers.
"In many parts of the world, a wave is a friendly gesture that means "hello."
"But in Malaysia, at least among Malaysians in rural areas, it means ""come here"", similar to the index finger bent to the body, a gesture used in some Western countries and should only be used for this purpose."
"In the same way, a British traveller in Spain may mistake a wave with the palm of his hand towards the one who is waving (rather than towards the one who is being waved to) as a gesture signalling ""come back""."
Auxiliary languages are artificial or constructed languages created for the purpose of facilitating communication between peoples who would otherwise have difficulty communicating.
They are different from lingua franca languages, which are natural or organic languages that become dominant for some reason as a way of communicating between speakers of other languages.
During the midday heat, travelers may experience mirages that give the illusion of water (or other things).
These can be dangerous if the traveler tries to reach the mirage, while wasting precious energy and remaining water.
Even the hottest deserts can get extremely cold at night. Cooling down is a serious risk if you lack warm clothes.
Beware of mosquitoes if you decide to hike in the rainforest during the summer.
Whether you drive through the subtropical rainforest, a few seconds with the doors open as you enter the vehicle is enough time for mosquitoes to get into the car with you.
Avian influenza, or avian influenza as it is more formally known, can infect both birds and mammals.
Less than a thousand cases have been reported in humans, but some have been fatal.
Most have been about people working with poultry, but there is also a certain risk for birdwatchers.
Typical for Norway are steep fjords and valleys that suddenly give way to a high, more or less even, plateau.
"These plateaus are often referred to as ''width'', meaning a vast, open landscape without trees, a boundless expanse."
"In Rogaland and Agder they are often called ""hey"", which means a treeless moorland, often covered with heather. "
The glaciers are not stable, but move downward along the mountain. This causes cracks, which can be hidden by snow bridges.
The walls and roofs of ice caves can collapse and cracks can be closed.
At the edge of the glacier, large blocks break off, fall down and can sometimes jump or roll further from the edge.
The tourist season in the mountain towns generally has its peak during the Indian summer.
However, they have a different kind of beauty and charm during the winter, as many mountain stations get plenty of snow and offer activities such as skiing and snowboarding.
Only a few airlines still offer special fares in the event of death, with a certain discount for last-minute trips to funerals.
Airlines offering these include Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for flights departing from the United States or Canada, and Westjet.
The trip must always be booked directly with the airline by phone.
