I hate being late.
No, you can't use my car!
I know you're busy.
I'll be alone.
What's it worth?
I'm happy to do it.
I'm afraid that's true.
We dress the Christmas tree.
What were you looking at?
The victim lay face down in the mat.
You're choking me.

Welcome!
It wasn't amazing.
Easily captured, easily past.
Has everyone found their mistakes?
Where does your uncle live?
The house was quiet.
I let my feelings cloud my judgment.
Tom grabbed Mary's hand.
People are sitting on the grass.
I heard a South American camper was eaten by an anaconda.

That's actually a good point.
Who said I stole the money?
They were vulnerable.
When was this temple built?
Don't you care?
This paper doesn't absorb ink.

We have to go right now.
Tom glanced down.
It's okay.
I am responsible for his behavior.
Tom is scared.
I got a tablet for Christmas.
She plays hockey on the weekends.
You don't talk much.
The red umbrella reminded her of her grandmother.
I remember the first time.
This is a very time-consuming task.

The other kids call her Piglet.
It meant a lot to me.
I'm not good at dancing.
I told Tom to take it easy.
I'm an old man now.
Tom is teaching.
She has taken on too much work.
She's stubborn.
Give Tom a hand.
You wouldn't like Tom.
Does Tom know how you feel about him?
Tom wondered if what Mary said was true.
We'll never get along.
It is uncertain whether the letter ever came forward or not.
We haven't done anything.
You dropped your pen.
Are you going to be in bed all day?
Tom can't do that.
Tom crawled under the barbed wire.
I didn't even know her name.
Are you really going to do that?
Give this to Tom.
Tom knows it's true.
She was crying.
Can I see Tom today?
No one wants that.
Who ruined this?

You should have seen her.
I need to buy stamps.

Try it now.
It didn't really affect us.
Did Tom vote?
I walk like a penguin.
Did I forget something?
You're taller than me.
Happy birthday.
I don't even want you here.
I love going to new places and seeing new things.
I have to sit down.
Aren't we friends?
Her speech bored me.
I can't eat chocolate.
I think we should do as Tom suggests, unless someone else has a better suggestion.
The ice is very thick.
Do you understand?
I can only speak for myself.
Tell me what the problem is.
Tom hit Mary.
You should have liked it.
I have a few more.
I use the computer.
Six were invited, the boy included.
Kate has a cold.
I know you miss your family.
What was your plan, anyway?
Tom seems bored.
He's not mad.
There is no doubt who will be elected.
He got hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep me motivated.
It's weird.
Have you read The Lord of the Rings trilogy?
I'm a man now.
Greek is not an easy language.
Thank you for taking care of my dog.
She advocated equality.
What are you looking at?
They died young.
Stop talking to me.
Greetings, little brother.
Where is the Portuguese Embassy?
My friends didn't let me down during the trial.
Tom shot me in the leg.
I was just teasing.
Stay down.
You weren't here then.
Here comes Tom.
I don't like modern jazz.
Tell Tom what you want to do.
We need to talk to you about Tom.
What about her?
Get dressed quickly.
I took the photo.
I said good morning.
The line to the test cabins circled through the shop.
I need an answer.
I hate my computer.
He lost control of the car in the corner.
I hope you find Tom.
Mary works in the city's public library.
We're different.
Get back in the van.
She helped the old man across the road.
No one is too old to learn.
I would do anything for love.
Two men with ski masks went into the bank.
This book belongs to the school library.
None of it was real.
There must be a pattern.
It hurts to have to say this, but it's the truth.
Tom tricked me.
Tom is helping.
One morning he saw a beautiful girl.
This tree is not even close to being the tallest in the parish.
Let me take a look.
Tom wants our help.
Time's up, turn in your papers.
My father is healthy.
We can save many lives.
If you don't have any money, you'll be fine without it.
I'm afraid to go home.
Just say it.
Helen's words suddenly filled me with new power.
Put the cake on the table.
I know you're angry.
Do you need anything?
I want a pair of gloves.
That's exactly what I needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I'm already late.
Even my mother knows about it.
He should have done it already.
Room service, please.
Who were you talking to?
The boy grabbed the cat's tail.
How do you know?
I got a lot of mosquito bites.
I'm unemployed.
This medicine will cure your cold.
Does this remind you of anyone?
I'd like to talk to Tom between four eyes.
He will fall for temptation.
The TV is not working.
I can explain that.
She's acting like a child.
What does it look like?
Mary thinks she has superpowers.
I know all this.
Everybody needs to know.
After the stop, the train accelerated quickly.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to agree, but can you at least accept that there are people who have different opinions than you?
Tom put the book down.
I'm the best.
English is hard, isn’t it?
I can go to school in 10 minutes.
Are you done now?
She couldn't imagine seeing him again.
Even during working hours, I give in to my internet addiction.
I never thought it would be this hard to create an iPad app.
You weren't gone long.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I can't get into town.
At least it wasn't boring.
Can you freeze it?
Tom blinked his headlights.
Are you threatening me?
Tom is worried.
I used to like coming here.
This is not a fish.
Maybe Tom and Mary didn't do what everyone says they did.
There's no one here called that.
It's time to go.
All three men smiled.
Come and sit down.
That's got to do.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.
My chainsaw is broken.
You think she's pretty, don't you?
He lived a simple life.
This is gonna take years.
I misspelled the word.
I don't like this book.
An octopus has ten arms.
She didn't come until two.
I am.
That was very good.
Come and talk to me.
He took care of the baby.
Leave me alone!
I had never seen such a peaceful sight.
Tom is fast.
About 4.9 per cent of Finns are Finns, i.e. people with Swedish as their mother tongue.
Unfortunately, Tom gave up.
What is the difference between American and British English?
I'm going to read the book.
I made the wedding cake.
Use a scalpel, not an axe.
Could you write down the link to that site?
She attached a photo.
The walls of the old house were not straight.
Where is she?
It feels really good.
Why do you like it?
What would you say if you were in this situation?
Give me three weeks.
The driver turned the steering wheel to the right.
I'm in the attic.
Tom said he doesn't eat meat.
Did you win?
Everybody dreams.
Flour is made from wheat.
How did you get this?
Is that relevant?
You gave it to me.
I knew you'd make sense.
On my return, I discovered the break-in.
The cat has two ears.
Not really.
You don't even like chocolate.
She likes to sing.
Christ is Risen!
I need your opinions.
I've had a rough afternoon.
Will you be waiting for us at the station?
I don't see anyone.
The more you get to know her, the more you'll like her.
Give Sami a kiss.
Are they in love with each other?
What is your favorite fast food restaurant?
Tom won't stay.
I'll do it.
We have to find it.
What's missing?
I can do it myself!
Don't worry.
She paid 7% interest on the loan.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to fire you.
Can I think about it?
When did you see Tom?
It's not important!
Strange things happened on her birthday.
Does anyone here speak Russian?
I drove the car.
I've got some great news.
Are we safe yet?
We tried to contact the other ship.
You're about to die.
This is not good.
I think you're right.
Monday starts on Sunday.
It really is not worth the effort.
"How old are you?" "I'm sixteen."
I have a blast of steel.
Have you heard from Tom?
We visited historically interesting places.
We're having steak tonight.
Tickets are only valid for two days, including the day they were purchased.
I have two foreign friends.
You might as well tell him in advance.
The number of people who smoke increased over the last ten years.
Call the fire department!
I had to make a decision.
You're not helping.
Can I talk to Tom?
What does Tom think?
What did Tom want to eat?
Their products are of the highest quality.
I was loved.
Do you own a firearm?
He knows too much.
Here we are!
I made the list.
How far for it?
Are we almost there?
All the doors in the house were closed.
Tom woke up when he heard someone knocking on the door.
We think you should come in.
What were you drinking?
Tom was curious.
Can you swim?
Turn off the radio.
Sleep!
I already told you.
What country are you from?
I want ice cream.
You shouldn't go out.
Let me explain.
Like I said, I was busy.
You don’t have to say anything if you don’t feel like it.
I made a bad mistake on the test.
Tom can't read.
You can't blame her for what she did.
How do they do that?
