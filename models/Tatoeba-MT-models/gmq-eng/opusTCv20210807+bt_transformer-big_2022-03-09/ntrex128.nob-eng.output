Welsh MPs don’t want to appear as ‘muppets’
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, known today by the abbreviation AM (Assembly Members), are not entirely satisfied with the suggestion that their title can be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes as a result of plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives from across the political spectrum fear that this could lead to ridicule.
A representative from the Labour Party explained his group was concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means "dusty", and pwp means "poop".
A representative for the Wales party Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole was "dissatisfied" and that they have suggested alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh section of the Conservative Party said that his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that the pronunciation of the MWP is very close to the word "Muppet", which in addition to being the name of some famous dolls, is also a British slang word for "dust".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced in a similar manner to the letter U pronounced in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like an "uh" sound.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the name change, said: “It is, of course, the members themselves who have the final say in what name to refer to.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Parliament the authority to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public hearing showing general support for renaming the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the representatives, the Commission supported WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members), but the alternative MWP received the most support during the public consultation.
Representatives are apparently proposing other options, but getting all parties to come to an agreement could lead to a headache for parliament president Elin Jones, who is scheduled to deliver a legislative draft for the name change in the next couple of weeks.
The legislation surrounding the reform will include other changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules for disqualification of representatives and the design of the committee system.
Representatives have the last vote on what they should be called when debating the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to decide if the country's name should be changed
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia can vote on whether the name of their country should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is being held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a region named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim on their territory, and has on several occasions opposed the country's applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum for the name change, has said that he will ignore the vote.
The supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's are stilling – the crows in Harlem are struggling
“The old people I spoke to have told me that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Adams.
“Now there’s neither.”
He said the bar's dropout was understandable.
“People socialize in other ways,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the meeting places of the local community, which everyone visits regularly.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money from selling possessions will not last as long as the leaders think. “And sooner or later they are back at the starting point.”
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who won't help the neighborhood's remaining sanctuaries.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and will therefore only hasten the day when these churches have to close their doors for good, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both crickets were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation took over the building.
St. Martin's received a black congregation under priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of dealers on 125th Street – one of Harlem's main hand-legates – because they failed to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, and when Father Johnson's parishioners made plans for the reconstruction, they purchased a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly declared the carillon to be "the church bells of the poor people".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's has never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's over the past few months is a complicated interaction between architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom are hired by the church's lay leadership and others by the diocese.
The church council – the church’s leadership, made up of lay people – wrote to the diocese in July regarding its concern that the diocese would “try to force the costs” on the church council, despite the fact that the church council had not been involved in the hiring of the architects or contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old on lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he dived after lobster in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting for help, and that he and a group of others swam over to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, at first he thought the boy was shouting with enthusiasm at catching a lobster, but he eventually realized that the boy was shouting 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
His entire collarbone was torn open,” says Hammel, who discovered the injury when he reached the boy.
"I shouted that everyone had to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was transported by air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is not known.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles also said that the victim suffered serious injuries in the upper torso.
Authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to make its entry into the UK beauty care market
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-like makeup and beauty care racks, staffed by specially trained staff.
The expanded shelves are being tested in 11 stores around the country as part of a powerful entry into the UK’s 2.8 million beauty care market, which is experiencing steady growth while falling sales figures for clothing and home goods. If the attempt proves successful, the concept will expand to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty care is a result of the supermarket's attempt to find a new use for the space previously used for TVs, microwave ovens and home appliances.
Sainsbury's has said it will double the number of beauty care products it offers to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the retail chain has never sold before.
Existing product ranges from L’Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt’s Bees will also have more space in branded areas, in the same way as in stores like Boots.
The supermarket chain is also relaunching its Boutique make-up brand with mainly vegan products, because there is an increasing demand for this among younger customers.
The Fragrance Shop will also be testing sales tables at two Sainsbury’s stores, one in Croydon, south London, last week, and the other in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a new tendency to buy small amounts of food daily from local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's has said that the outlets will eventually look more and more like a department store, as the supermarket takes up the fight against the cheap stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods outside of food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets after buying both chains two years ago. According to them, this has increased food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempts to upgrade its beauty and pharmacy departments were unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership was discontinued after a dispute over distribution of the income from the pharmacies of the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 retail pharmacies to Celesio, owner of the Lloyd's Pharmacy pharmacy chain, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a selection of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We’ve transformed the look and feel of our beauty shelves to create a more welcoming environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who will be so prepared to give advice and help.
Our brand range is designed to meet every need, and our welcoming surroundings and convenient locations make us a beauty care competitor that represents a new shopping experience.”
Peter Jones is 'outraged' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of a deal worth GBP 11 million
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones is reportedly furious after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million dollar deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessory brand, Truly.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop.
Willoughby (37), host of This Morning, announced on Instagram that she is leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons' Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their profitable last-second lifestyle brand to focus on their own new gold-lined contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “furious” at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. It was here that the television’s golden girl admitted that her new deals – worth up to GBP 1.5 million – mean she no longer has time to spare for their clothing and accessories brand, Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop, and it was expected that it would double Willoughby's estimated fortune of GBP 11 million.
While Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she will be leaving Truly, Jones left the UK on her way to one of her holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly, Holly was the number one priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her financial security for the next few decades.
Everyone is shocked that she has decided to leave.
No one could believe it when it happened last Tuesday – it was right before the launch.
Now a department store full of goods stands at the headquarters in Marlow, which is now ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the This Morning host, who is among the UK’s most popular stars, could cost the company several million pounds due to large investment in products such as pillows and candles, fashion and cowhide clothing, as well as a potential delay in its launch.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became chairman in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV program I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, "We will not comment on his business dealings".
“We were in love and then we fell in love.”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for making a comment some would consider "little presidential," and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given so much away?
said Trump in his imitation of a news anchor.
“I haven’t given anything away.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a new meeting, having himself declared that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a major filth on the road to nuclear disarmament by North Korea.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a "similar response" from the United States to its early disarmament measures.
He noted that instead, the U.S. still has sanctions designed to keep up the pressure.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke in favor of an assembly of his constituents.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results, such as putting an end to rocket tests, helping to free hostages and having the remains of U.S. officials sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to act with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the area right in front of him.
Indonesia Earthquake and Tsunami Destroy Island, Killing Hundreds
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-profit organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10% of Lombok residents had lost their homes, a national disaster was not declared, which is a requirement for international aid to be submitted.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it quite clear that they are not asking for international help. so it is quite challenging,” explained Sumbung.
Rescue the children are now putting together a team to travel to Palu, but are not yet sure whether foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the National Agency for Crisis Management, said that Indonesian authorities are considering the situation in Palu to see if international organisations should be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Considering the earthquakes Indonesia is constantly exposed to, the country is terribly ill-prepared to deal with the wrath of nature.
Shelters to protect against tsunamis are built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a warning siren on Palu, although a warning had been issued, has probably contributed to the death toll.
Even under the best of circumstances, it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made an upgrade of Indonesia's dilapidated infrastructure a focal point of his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on road and rail.
But money shortages have been a major problem for Joko’s administration, which is due for re-election next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have switched to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge with late equaliser in match against Chelse
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea on Saturday by scoring in the 89th minute of the match at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards from the Chelsea goal while his team was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to his left foot before sending it towards the farthest corner.
The attempt went high over the box as the ball dropped towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally went over a bouncing Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq are always sending the ball forward as best they can, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and touch the ball once and didn't think too much about it and just kicked it on."
Chelsea led by 1-0 at the break, after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker sent a pass with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic, before changing direction near midfield and sprinting into Liverpool's half of the pitch.
Kovacic made a quick handover in midfield.
He then fired off a great breakthrough pass that brought Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the far corner with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play Videoton in the men's Europa League at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday.
Indonesia tsunami death toll reaches 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's crisis management agency announced early Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5-strong earthquake that struck the country on Friday and caused waves of up to six meters, the agency's spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho explained at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of materials from demolished buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man for murder after a woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with stab wounds at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews in John Street. A 32-year-old man has been arrested, suspected of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard something about making contact.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “We are at the very beginning of the investigation, but I would ask anyone who was in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious about contacting us.
We also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on their car camera, to get in touch – they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the deceased woman was a resident of Birkenhead, and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the scene to ask questions about the location where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police have said they are working to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been told that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are told it will be several hours before they can return.
A police officer was overheard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She repeated, “It’s so horrible” over and over again.
At 2 p.m., two police cars were behind the lockup, while a third car was just outside.
A number of police officers stood outside the cordon and supervised the apartment complex.
People who have information are asked to send an instant message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, by referring to “log 247” from September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last memorial drawn into the argument of "rewriting history"
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Comwell Society has described Jeremy Crick's publishing as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, says: “It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside the Palace of Westminster would also become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's stunning depiction of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century opinions and is part of the historiography of a man many believe still deserves tribute.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, as Parliament’s defender against outside pressures – in his day, of course, there was talk of the monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate representation is still the subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th-century conflict has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killing pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, who is only referred to by the surname "Yuan", was found dead and covered in blood from a ruptured artery near a binge at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to put vaccines on pigs on a farm on May 30, 2005 in the city of Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He had reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered that the gate of a nearby pigsty was open.
He said that inside the pigsty there was a big boar with blood on its mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-kg pig had killed the man.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mauled,” explained the cousin, referred to by the surname Wu, in a quote to the Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
While the police gathered evidence from the scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else.
Yuan's family and market leadership are reportedly negotiating compensation for the death.
Even if it does happen, it is not the first time a pig has been recorded to have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on a farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pushed up against a tractor and attacked by a pig of 300 kg until the farmer's wife was able to chase away the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba explained to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive by default, but that the taste of blood can have a triggering effect.
“They’re just playing.
They like to bite, and are very curious...they don’t try to hurt anyone.
You just have to show enough respect.”
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rains in the southwestern United States
As reported, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves across the cooler ocean on the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa will still bring flooding rains on her journey through northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa had a wind speed of 135 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane at 05:00 ET on Sunday, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a trough begins to form across the Pacific Ocean and move east toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture north toward the southwest United States.
Pink will cause up to 25 cm of precipitation in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Thereafter, the interaction between tropical moisture and the approaching trough will lead to widespread heavy rain in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous flooding, liquid debris and rapid and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will lead to precipitation rates of up to 5-7 cm per hour in some areas, especially areas in southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 3 inches (5-10 cm) of rain is expected in parts of the Southwest, especially across much of Arizona.
There are opportunities for flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered tropical rains.
It is very unwise to move around the desert on foot as long as there is a danger of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rain can cause river valleys to turn into brimming rushing rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to local gusts of wind that may contain dust and sand.
The approaching trough will cause local heavy rain showers for parts of the coast along Southern California.
Total rainfall over 1.3 cm is possible, and this can lead to liquid debris and fast, as well as slippery roadways.
This will be the area's first rainfall of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning, before rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and persist throughout Wednesday.
October can cause some intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder but the tropics stay very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We will see a clear example of severe temperature differences throughout the central United States on Sunday.
There will be nearly an 11-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern United States will likely get a warm start to October, with degrees high in the twenties from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York City can reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday – this will be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate report indicates that the eastern United States is most likely to have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers, across six television networks, saw Thursday's poignant testimony from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political feud continued, and broadcasters interrupted their regular broadcasts to announce Friday's big surprise at the last second, when it emerged that the Senator for Arizona, Jeff Flake, had arranged for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent sure that a drunken Kavanaugh was groping her and trying to take her clothes off at a middle school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he is 100 percent certain that this did not happen.
The broadcast on Friday was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average ratings for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Viewer numbers were not immediately available to other networks showing the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring office viewers.
To give some perspective, this is the ratings that correspond to the playoffs of the American Football Championships or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose polls have supported Kavanaugh's appointment with great enthusiasm, led the networks, with average ratings of 5.69 million for the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
There was a lot of interest after the hearing.
Flake was the main character for Friday's drama.
The moderate Republican office issued a statement saying he would vote in Kavanaugh's favor. On Friday morning, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras as he tried to take the elevator to a court committee meeting as protesters yelled and yelled at him.
He stood with lowered eyes for several minutes while being scolded, while the incident was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling our country the truth?"
He was told that “you have the power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake pointed out that his office has made a statement, saying as the elevator doors closed that he would have more to say about the matter at the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks all covered the hearing directly several hours later, when the court committee was to vote on whether to pass Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate for voting.
But Flake said he was only willing to do this if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate by next week, which the Democratic minority has called for.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to the Coons and then several other senators.
Flake's election had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May Accuses Critics of ‘Political Games’ Around Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused opponents of her plan to leave the EU of playing “political games” with Britain’s future and undermining the nation’s interests.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, printed side by side with her own on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson has continued her attack against her so-called “Chequers” plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to catch up with each other’s tariffs was “completely ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of causing LSU player's death
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) has been arrested and charged with intentional murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities have released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the basketball game.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS partner WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admits shooting and killing Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, according to The Advocate.
The coroner of East Baton Rouge Parish published a preliminary report on Friday, stating the cause of death as a gunshot wound to the head and through the throat.
Police thank the Louisiana State Police's task force for the capture of refugees, the state police laboratory, the Southern University police and locals for contributions to the investigation that led to an arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the area's police force for its "hard work and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "crushed" and "in shock" after Wayde's death.
"This is what we fear at all times," Wade said.
Volcano splashes ash over Mexico City
The ash that spews out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The Centro Nacional de Prevención de Desastres, Mexico's public agency for crisis prevention, warned Mexico's population on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after activity rose in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded over the course of one day.
The agency monitored several cases of rumination and shaking.
Photos on social media showed a thin layer of ash covering windshields on the cars in neighborhoods such as Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is located 72 km southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protesters for independence clashed with police, while thousands took part in competing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists were detained by riot police, bombarding them with eggs and powder paint, which caused dark dust clouds in streets usually full of tourists.
Hand gangs also broke out later in the day, as police used batons to limit fighting.
For hours, independence protesters stood and shouted "Never forget, never forgive", face to face with unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they received during the protests, according to the local press.
Tensions remain high in the liberation-oriented region one year after the October 1 referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming majority for secession, but there was poor turnout because the vote was boycotted by most people who opposed liberation.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after police tried to halt the vote being conducted at polling stations across the region.
Liberation groups camped in the streets on the night of Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held anyway, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist seminary with his wife, said he no longer had hopes for Catalonia's chance to become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy at being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalan independence have had trouble keeping up the pressure this year, as many of their bitterly known leaders have gone into self-imposed exile or are in detention while awaiting trial for their role in holding the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used her phone to film the protest to support the police, said the conflict is being stirred up by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is becoming more and more tense,” he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been jailed pending a trial since late last year, announced that he will stand for election in the European Parliament next year.
"To stand for election as a candidate in the European elections is the best thing I can do to condemn the repression and regression of democratic values we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car was driven several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. BST.
Police Superintendent Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Menga's attack leads to Livingston's 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
Promoted Livinston astounded Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
A good hit from Dolly Menga proved crucial, and Gary Holt's side is now tied with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side have still not won away in the Premier League this season and will play leaders Hearts, who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Rangers will play their home game against Rapid Wien in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, in turn, has remained undefeated through six games in the division. Chief coach Holt has yet to lose a game after he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses out on opportunities against his dull guests
Holt's team should have led long before they scored, as their direct approach caused countless problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but missed the goal, and Alan Lithgow could only pass the kick further after slipping in to face Craig Halkett header past the goal.
The hosts let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could make trouble for their guests at deadball.
And that’s how the crucial goal came about.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to give Menga a clear pitch, and he scored a goal from in the middle of the box.
By this stage, the Rangers had had the ball pretty much the whole time, but the home team's defense had proved to be impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed an almost score that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of Rangers keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston deathball in a wide short pass.
Cruises constantly entered the Livingston box and were constantly saved, while two penalty claims – once after Halkett's protest against substitute Glenn Middleton, and once at hand – were overlooked.
“Phenomenal” from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were all amazing, and continue to exceed all expectations on the way up.
The style of play and the crew have hardly changed since they got back on top, but Holt should have a lot of credit for the way he has strengthened the team after his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and coordinated a hugely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the game.
The Rangers didn’t have my inspiration.
Although at times they have been very good under Gerrard, they failed to live up to this standard.
The last part of the game was a lap – they only made it into the home team’s half of the field once – and that was quite a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just smiles and blue skies on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany had breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between the NATO allies.
Disagreements have arisen over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security as the reason why a crowd of 25,000 were not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan – many of them Kurds – also got in touch, criticising both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to allow him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the discord that follows a man hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Deptford collision: Cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist is killed in a collision like a passenger car in London.
The collision took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city, around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by paramedics, but the man died at the scene.
The collision takes place just one month after a cyclist died in a hit-and-run where the driver escaped from the scene in Childrens Street, about a mile from Saturday's collision.
The Metropolitan Police said police are working to identify the man and alert the relatives.
Roadblocks and bus bypasses are in place, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers have been injured in an incident at a men's high-security prison, according to prison authorities.
Riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. BST on Sunday, and are still going on.
Specialized "Tornado" officers are brought in to handle the incident, which involves eight inmates and is limited to one wing.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesperson for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison staff have been sent in to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons – those responsible will be transferred to the police, and may have to spend even more time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison received hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, riot police were called in to deal with a serious incident in which employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (may be beneficial to drought areas)
It is rare that Arizona is hit by a tropical depression, but just that is likely to happen early next week, as Hurricane Rosa's remaining force moves through the desert areas of the southwest and carries flood danger.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that rain will start late Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has noted on Twitter that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the Arizona border."
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 5-10 cm of precipitation, with up to 15 cm in some locations in the Mongolian Rim, Arizona.
Other areas within the desert in the southwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of precipitation is possible in some areas.
For those who are out of flood danger, Rosa can be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, since the southwestern United States is currently in a drought state.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought, which is the second-highest category," according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa hits land off the Mexican Peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with maximum wind speed of 137 km, located 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving 19 km/h.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, thereby losing power.
Therefore, it is expected to hit Mexico with tropical storm strength on Monday evening or afternoon.
The rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and cause great flood risk.
"Total rainfall of 7.5-15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with opportunities for up to 25 cm of precipitation," according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, as this moves further through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected of Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States," according to the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall is expected to produce deadly flooding and liquid debris and rapid in the desert and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested, suspected of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area by Midsomer Norton at around 4:00 a.m. BST on Sunday.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
Police have asked anyone who may have mobile recordings of the incident to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh has “suffered from the pettyness and anger” of the Democratic Party
"A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said ahead of a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered from the pettiness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, and vigorously and emotionally denied the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford is also testifying on his charge during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw how brilliant, skillful and brave" Kavanaugh was that day.
"A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to support one of the most accomplished lawyers of our time, with impeccable behavior in public service," he told an audience of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president discreetly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when talking about the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I'm not really a participant, but I'm a participant," he said.
"That's why I'm going around fighting for the best candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats aim to "resist and hinder".
The Senate's first mid-term vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to the assistant to a leader of the Republican Party has told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian landslide and tsunami, numbers expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were dragged out to sea by huge waves pounding against the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Slawesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves thundered ashore around sunset, destroying everything in its path and dragging many into drowning death.
The tsunami came on the heels of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami danger arose yesterday, people were still doing activities on the beach, did not immediately escape and ended up as victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for Indonesia's Emergency Management Agency (BNBP) said at a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami was not alone – it was carrying cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived."
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the crisis management department showed many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The number of earthquakes could be felt by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the power of Friday's huge earthquake was about 200 times more than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami larger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be the larger land coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication “was completely crippled, completely without information” from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a press release, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, but authorities said the waves had hit before the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared on social media, one hears a man on the top floor of a building shouting desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching to passers-by on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water thunders towards the beach, tearing down buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately authenticate the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that has hindered communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending transport planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but the evacuees are still in desperate need of food and other necessities.
The city's airport is only open for relief work, and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises over 800.
It's absolutely cruel.
World Vision staff from Donggala have made it safely to Palu city centre, where they have sought shelter under tarpaulin tents in the courtyard in front of their office, but they passed heavy destruction on the road, according to Doseba Sinay.
“They told me they saw hundreds of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's absolutely cruel.
As aid agencies began the grim preparations to deliver emergency aid, some complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be let into a crisis area until it is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'OK, this is a national disaster' we can open the borders for international aid, but the situation has not been given any status yet."
As the sun sets on Palu for the second time after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing hope that their loved ones will be among the miracle stories that brighten up the grim news after tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was fished out of a sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was freed by rescuers after spending two days trapped under ruins with the body of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were conducted earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those trapped in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Monday, were also his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional should to carry,” he said.
Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding community, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the practitioners who attended the beach festival at Palu.
But the messages only led to gray checkmarks, rather than a pair of blue checkmarks.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal US$26,750 during ATM refill in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole US$26,750 from a Brink's worker who filled an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and was getting ready to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, there was another man who "ran up behind that Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects escape from the scene, according to the press release, but police have not specified how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identity must contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rapper Changes His Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The creation formerly known as Kanye West.”
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for a long time, using the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the program, after she cancelled on "emotional grounds", according to the series creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, when discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more a representation of who we are."
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with West, has also varied between the use of hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use the military against civilians
Mexico’s president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody student reprisals.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he "will never ever use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Military troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, during a period when leftist student movements took root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to students and opening several free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Financial Support for Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, investor and practitioner of artificial intelligence, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements regarding artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, for its part, introduced a plan last year and aims to be number one in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“A double artificial intelligence research budget would be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we’re looking for the next big breakthrough,” Lee said.
Double financial support could double the chance that the next big achievement in artificial intelligence will come from the United States," Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the top artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop a system of artificial intelligence that beat America's best Othello player, and later was a leader at Microsoft Research or director of Google's Chinese department.
Lee recognized the U.S. government's previous technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one will be held, to help find the next generation's wise heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government grants, according to Lee.
"It's not China stealing the academic leaders, it's the companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired smart heads from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says changes in immigration policies could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I believe that those who have a PhD in artificial intelligence should receive an offer of a residence permit automatically,” he said.
China's Minister of State issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the development of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation funds people at academic institutions, in a similar way to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations handing out money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defense Department created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, they are currently investing more than USD 100 million in research into artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the U.S. legislation aimed at establishing a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has been stalled for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" in order to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province named Macedonia, believes that the northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim on Greek territory, and has vetoed including them in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new hub, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the turnout will meet the minimum requirement of 50 percent, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership when approving the deal with Greece?”
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, one country that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, to be able to gain membership in organizations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU's protective umbrella, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgiyevska (79) in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, it will probably be decisive, because a high enough number of MPs have said they will abide by the result of the vote.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission has said that they had not received any irregularity reports by 1:00 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent at the 2016 general election, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their vote.
"I came to vote because of my children - we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski (62) who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko are voting in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The referendum in Macedonia is about changing the country's name to open the doors for them to become members of NATO and the EU.
In front of the Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small stage and pulled out chairs in front of tents set up by those who are going to boycott the vote.
“We are positive about NATO and the EU, but we want to be reported with a raised head, not let in the back way,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our worth.
If they won’t accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 of our citizens want us to join the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He says that a “yes” answer will be a “confirmation of our future”.
According to a survey released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum – this is lower than the required turnout.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of blacks plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will constitute the first serious political obstacle the pro-Western government has encountered since it took over last May.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero Manoeuvres Across Brighton's Defense to Score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling smashed the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-4 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a pass at the start of the sequence.
He raced three Brighton defenders before making it onto open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He made it around one defender before running from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
He then sent a pass to the left that reached Sterling.
The English striker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero is still struggling with some foot problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told the press.
“We were talking about him playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
He was lucky to score a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the original advantage in the Premier League game.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball placed inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough pass along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a couple of touches before bringing Sterling towards the farthest corner.
The Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the net just before it was over the dead line.
City play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12.55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a spoiler for the Rockies
The Nationals are no longer candidates for the playoffs, and have no reason to bet heavily.
Still, the ever-matched competitive Scherzer hopes to stand on the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoff opportunities of the Colorado team, who lead the Los Angeles Dodgers by one game in the NL West.
The Rockies were given a wild card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to secure their first division title.
While we have nothing to gain, we can at least play with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the public and the other team, will be the most likely to be the highest level of play I get to play at this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in it?”
The Nationals have still not announced their starting pitcher for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to take Scherzer pitches in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is the starting pitcher for the 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has this season won 18 games and lost 7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump's People's Assembly in West Virginia
The president discreetly referred to the situation surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big ... I’m not a participant, but I’m a participant. That’s why I travel around and fight for the best candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this cruel, cruel group of radical democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take back their power at all costs, and there you see the smallness and the meanness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, aim to “resist and hinder.”
“And you’re seeing it over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “insane and mean and nasty and dishonest.”
Referring to the Senate Judiciary Committee, he mentioned Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, upon which the audience booed loudly.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um no, I’m expecting one – it was very bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They don’t tolerate people who speak their mind.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a long line of Labour MPs to have been told that we are not welcome just because we say what we mean.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was going to be censored because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of having responsible economic policies, on national security, on Europe – ironically, similar issues to those Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders about.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday nights have been just that.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the mood of many of the meetings, and the promise of “softer, friendlier” politics is long forgotten, if at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the Labour Party, and all opinions are judged based on whether they are acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I previously thought I shared many political attitudes with suddenly began to expect me to take a U-turn and stand for opinions I had never previously agreed with, whether they were about national security or the EU’s internal market.
When I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – I receive a wealth of ugly messages on social media demanding that I be dismissed, condemning center politics and telling me that I shouldn’t be in Labour.
And I’m not the only one who has experienced this.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they encounter an ocean that sexist and racist comments every day, but never lets themselves be cowed.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how crude denunciation has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to everyone, and every motion of no confidence and every change in the electoral rules narrows the party.
I’ve received a lot of advice over the past two years where I’m encouraged to keep my head down and not raise my voice so much, because it will “make everything better.”
But that’s not why I got involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the Thatcher government's neglect that had led to my public school classroom being literally dilapidated, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, both as a local councillor and government minister.
I have never concealed my political views, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have in any way misunderstood my political views or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who put forward the representative proposal on Friday, I just want to say that as the country rages our way towards a Brexit that will hurt individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot fathom and understand the desire to waste time and effort on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to the Nottingham Momentum – it is to those I represent, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of dismissal or political compromise will prevent me from doing what I believe best serves your interests.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr rises to the top
Two late attempts have slightly changed the final score, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They are now at the top of the table, and are the only undefeated of the ten.
In the end, it was as much their superior defense as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities they were given that led to the home team leaving the win, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be satisfied.
"We have been challenged in our games so far and are still undefeated, so I have to be happy with that," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “All credit to Ayr, they were better at taking advantage of the opportunities than we were.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, with goal kicks from Frazier Climo gave Ayr the lead, but a yellow card to Scotland captain Rory Hughes, loaned from the Warriors, allowed Melrose to level the position, and Jason Baggot performed a try without goal kick.
Climo strengthened Ayr's lead with a penalty kick before he, just before the break, scored and goal-kicked a solo attempt to change the score to 17-0 at break.
But Melrose started the second half strong, and Patrick Anderson's try, with goal kicks from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This was a longer stay in connection with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried out on stretcher, and from the restart Ayr increased the lead even more ed an attempt from Stafford McDowell, with goal kicks from Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blain Macpherson, was then given a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having an extra man on the field to the fullest with a try from Bruce Colvine without a goal kick, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the home team came back strong, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for tackling Climo when he did not have the ball, MacPherson performed a touchdown by throw-in behind the advancing Ayr maul.
Climo performed a goal kick, as he did again almost entirely from restart, after Kyle Rowe overtook David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregor Henry off for the home team's fifth try.
The Still Game star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that Still Game star Ford Kieran is entering the hospitality industry – it was recently discovered that he is named as the director of a restaurant company with a liquor license.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, for which he writes and plays with his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The dove has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and it looks like Kiernan is now planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor would not comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "lively restaurant industry".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a land without a coastline, hopes the right will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a rigged naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a sea-blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it.”
The entire inland state of Bolivia still has fresh memories of the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, and the country longs to once again be able to sail the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps greater than they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits an International Court of Justice ruling on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has drive, community spirit and serenity, and of course awaits the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ruling of the International Court of Justice on the big screen in many different parts of the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will give its ruling in favor of Bolivia’s claim that Chile – after decades of sporadic negotiations – is committed to negotiating to give Bolivia its own outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president – who faces a controversial re-election campaign next year – has also staked heavily on Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to a return to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court would hardly take Bolivia's side, and that very little would change if it had.
The UN body, which the team of the Netherlands, has no authority to allow them to give away Chilean lands, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The ruling by the International Court of Justice comes just six months after the last arguments were heard implying that the case “was not complicated,” according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than having promoted Bolivia’s cause, the last four years may actually have made things worse.
"The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
She believes that Morales' antagonistic rhetoric has corroded any remaining goodwill on Chile's part.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations on one point or another, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the theory that the court's decision came unusually quickly.
On Monday, he said, Bolivia would provide “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new generation’s relationship with Chile” and “end 139 years of disagreement, for the benefit of both parties.”
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – who remains one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – has used the maritime situation as a political cover.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
“Feeling is an opportunity to see what we have to do to overcome the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Won't Happen Unless It Can Trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not rely on the U.S. government.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the promises it made during a meeting of the two conflicting countries' leaders in Singapore.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be ready to initiate the stalemate of nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it’s a “wishful dream” that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
The U.S. government is sceptical about accepting the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to have a second meeting.
But there are widespread doubts about whether Pyongyang really plans to let go of an arsenal the country probably sees as the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest in huge headwear, heading for a clothing store near you
If you want some great additions to your hat collection or hide completely from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a selection of quirky, oversized headgear as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed fashionistas at Paris Fashion Week.
Highly impractical hats have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
Valentino's most startling garment was an exaggerated beige hat embellished with a feather-like wide brim that drowned the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a wizard hat, or even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had re-sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the last scream.
One creation resembled diving equipment, including snorkeling and diving goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream in biscuits.
And if you’re looking for even more great fashion accessories, then you’re in luck.
Style experts predict that the huge hats may be headed for a clothing store near you.
The oversized hats come right on the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a half-meter wide brim that has been seen on everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult behind the highly impractical hat that dominated social media has now sent yet another big creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straws almost as big as the swimsuit model that carries it.
The orange raffia case, lined with raffia fringes and complemented by a white leather handle, was the most eye-catching creation in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at fashion week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the clothing stores next summer – when the designer has had such a big impact, it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are crucial for world citizens
The academic excellence of Scotland’s independent schools has continued in 2018 with another year of outstanding exam results, underpinned by individual and joint success in sports, arts, music and other community initiatives.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (the Scottish Free Schools Council), have more than 30,000 students across Scotland, working hard to deliver the very best school experience to both students and parents.
Free schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational institution that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and in demand elective in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the words reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, his words reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we can’t just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's exam results, we see that languages are at the top of the table with the highest pass percentages from free schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received the examination grade A.
The data, obtained from the Free School Council's 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students received the A grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received A.
This illustrates that free schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a crucial skill children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as a subject is now valued at the same level as science as science, technology, engineering and mathematics on the curriculum for free schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that of the reasons employers cited for having trouble filling a vacancy, 17 per cent could be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become essential in a globalized world.
If you have learned a second language, these lifelong skills will bring real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey answered by more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a two-digit number of participants (15 percent) could speak.
This is why investing in language learning is now crucial for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those related to emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland if each school teach in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages that are considered most valuable to the UK on the road to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what interests your child, there will always be a selection of languages to choose from at free schools, with teachers who are experts in this area.
Scottish free schools aim to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today’s global business environment that language is increasingly crucial to the country’s future, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication ability".
Friskoler will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and distinction for Scotland’s youth.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron will make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play remains to be determined.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career," he replied.
Time of Trump's public meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President starts a series of election people's meetings tonight Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s the first of Trump’s five scheduled public meetings over the next week, including stops in cities where he has a lot of support, like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote for his chosen Supreme Court candidate is on hold, Trump aims to garner support for the upcoming midterm elections, since Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when voters go to the polls in November.
When is Trump’s West Virginia rally tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to start at 7:00 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's public meeting in West Virginia online below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual assault. An expected confirmation vote is put on hold for up to a week while the FBI investigates the case.
With the main goal of all these public meetings is to support Republicans facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump has said that these five gatherings over the next few weeks aim to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
"Congress control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we move toward a busy campaign season," Reuters was told by a campaign spokesperson for Trump who did not want to be named.
The evening's public meeting, scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, may attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and is covered by the Pittsburgh press," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in the polls.
"It's a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, an expert on political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows fighting spirit to keep faith as they enter Sunday’s singles game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes may have been just what this year's Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of the momentum is a completely fictional sports concept, yet something players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
"They led by six points and now there are four, so we're carrying that with us as a bit of momentum," said Jordan Spieth as he left the field for the day.
Of course, Europe will have the advantage – they lead by four points and there are 12 left to play for.
But as Spieth says, Americans feel they’ve got some wind in their sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent play from tee to green, and leads by example.
The deep celebration screams became louder as his round continued, sinking to a crucial putting to raise the match to a draw as he and Thomas were two down after two.
His putting, which won them the match at 15, was met with a similar scream – of the kind that shows that he still does not believe the American team is without a chance.
"We really just have to put all the cloths on and focus on our own match," Spieth said.
That's all each of these players have now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, which is undoubtedly Ryder Cup's big success story.
Europe's unusual but glorious pair has four out of four and doesn't set a foot wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple to avoid a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided bogey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the lively crowd make it clear that they are Sunday's biggest competitors, and there is no other player the crowd would rather see secure a European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time, in separate holes.
It is too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson easily hammered up with Sergio Garcia, the fourballs hero of the morning, when he was partnered with Alex Noren.
After one bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes, the Spaniard and Swede were so far behind that they had no chance of catching up.
On Sunday, there will be no help.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to watch up close because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give each other, the advice they don’t give and how a strategy can turn around in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is way ahead of last day, but this foursomes session also showed that Team USA has the fighting spirit some, especially in the US, have missed.
Europe lead 10-6 at the start of the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong lead at the start of the final day of the Ryder Cup, after having finished Sunday's fourballs and foursomes games with a 10-6 lead against the United States.
Brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two wins against a broken Tiger Woods, raising their score for Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bjørn's European side, struggling to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's ill-fated side in this morning's fourballs and won the series 3–1.
The United States gave more opposition in the foursomes and won two matches, but they did not catch up.
Jim Furyk's side must collect eight points from Sunday's 12 singles games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari – nicknamed “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend – are the only pair to score four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they collaborated seamlessly to beat down broken Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who limped through two matches on Saturday, flashed occasionally, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for this morning's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in foursomes and performed a 2&1 win against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked number one and three worldwide.
But Europe did not get everything they wanted on this warm day with a light breeze southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won majors three times, set the standard for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard-fought 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team managed to recover after a four-point lead at the start of the singles game, but as current holders, only Furyk's side need to achieve a draw to retain the trophy.
But after being second best for two days, it doesn't look like they'll be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea 'in no way' will agree to unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthened distrust of the United States, and that the country will in no way agree to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's annual general assembly that North Korea has implemented "significant goodwill measures" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test area and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We have not seen a similar response from the United States," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to gradual nuclear disarmament, where North Korea is rewarded for gradual disarmament steps, but his declaration was significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on June 12, at the very first meeting between a sitting President of the United States and a North Korean leader, in which Kim pledged to work towards "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula," while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the Korean War that lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first let go of its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to reduce strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament first', and raises the pressure via sanctions to achieve its goal by force, even opposing the 'declaration of the end of the war'," according to Ri.
“The belief that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a pipe dream for people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions create further distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second hit between Kim and Trump as the US leader stressed in front of the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months, adding: “If the other party in this disarmament case were South Korea, rather than the United States, nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have become as entrenched as it is.”
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on the mainland United States by North Korea's missiles was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
After threatening to “completely destroy” North Korea last year, Trump stood in front of the United Nations this year and praised Kim for being brave enough to take disarmament steps, but said much work still remains to be done, and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he did not have a time frame for this, saying that "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “Security Council sanctions still need to be enforced vigorously and without exception, until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to cut funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile weapons program.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and afterwards said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said they had made progress, but only hours later North Korea accused him of making “gangster demands.”
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to shut down a missile area as well as a nuclear weapons facility if the United States took "similar measures".
He said Kim had said that these “similar measures” he wants were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take Course in Getting Enough Rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will help students get more sleep by tackling the growing unculture of puking through the night with caffeine drinks as fuel.
One academic found that students at the world’s best universities often had no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He started the course after giving a lecture on the impact sleep deprivation has on learning.
“After the talk, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why hasn’t anyone said this before?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and it surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains to the students how important it is to have good sleep habits in order to perform academically and sportingly, and for the general condition.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and CEO of the university's health services, said the university decided to start the course after they saw that the students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation.
The course, which lasts for one hour, has a series of interactive assignments.
In one part there is a picture of a room in a dormitory, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books and hear about the effects of caffeine and light and how sporty performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and how important a sleep routine is.
In another part, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons makes participants think about their own daily routine.
“We are aware that this is not going to change students’ behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know about this, just as you have the right to know about the risks of smoking," Professor Czeisler said.
There is still some pride in being able to memorize all night, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students led to sleep deprivation being an increasing problem.
Enough and good sleep should be the students’ “secret weapon” against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even as a means of weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, leading to constant hunger pangs.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course. He took one of the classes to the professor last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course inspired him to work for a course that was available to the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all master students to take a similar program of study before enrolling in university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm for when to go to bed as well as for when to get up, and that they had to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights. This type of light can disrupt circadian rhythms and lead to sleep difficulties.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Goal of Menga knocks out Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another away loss when Dolly Menga's goal beat Steven Gerrard's team 1–0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox side wanted to get their first win since February's win 4-1 at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager and since left his eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers never managed to equalize.
The Rangers now fall down to sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to third and is behind Hibernian on goal difference.
There may be more trouble in fermenting for Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an item was thrown from away crowd.
Gerrard made eight substitutions on the team, sweeping past Ayr and into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been happy how his well-trained team beat the opponents.
The Rangers had perhaps the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should have scored just two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the chance.
A long free kick by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot at the goal bar.
The Rangers took control, but it looked like their game leaned more on hope than belief in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have had a penalty kick after 15 minutes, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson declined this.
Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not have problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cold when he selected Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent during the break, and the player switch gave immediate results when the winger sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get the away players to play just the kind of game they like, as Lithgow and Halkett caught up long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched the lead in the last half, but McGregor stood up to Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty kick as he got into conflict with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
The Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from the “Sunday Morning” almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the apparatus we know today as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has been an important part of science since then, and also became part of popular culture via the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What in the world is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter. It finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you touch these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “Let’s say it makes a noise now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention to which he gave his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine may teach immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells
New cancer vaccine may teach immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Cancer Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory
The cells can now “see” a protein that is common in many cancers, and are then injected into the patient again.
A vaccine under trial has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, experienced that the ovarian cancer she suffered from disappeared for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2, which is typical of many cancers, and then injecting these cells into the patient again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “drives the growth of various cancers,” including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, in which immune cells were taken from the patient and “trained” to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, wearing a MAGA hat, made fierce defense of Trump after the SNL appearance.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after a groping performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he lashed out at the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
“It happens so often that I talk to a white person and they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
If I was afraid of racism, I would have moved from the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judicial Committee about the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock wanted to ridicule West by posting the recording.
West also complained to the public that he heard it in the back room regarding the choice of headgear.
“They bullied me.
They said, “Don’t go out there with that hat on.”
They bullied me!
And then they said I don't understand what the reality is," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see that I understand what the reality is?” he said, saying that he would “put on my Superman cape, because then no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try love.”
His comments were booed at least twice, and the staff working at SNL looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one staff member saying: “The whole studio went quiet.”
West was brought in as the last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, when her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he performed the song "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of our bravest: THANK YOU FOR STANDING AGAINST THE MASS.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "who he is and it's absolutely amazing".
"But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art') which I believe cultivates and spews ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
We are too,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that from now on, he was "the creature formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and now follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper colleague Snoop Dogg has had the name Snoop Lion. Then of course there is the late music legend Prince, who changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who used to be known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder after stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The charge is expected to be made before Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The indictment will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington goes head-to-head with 'gifty masculinity'
Kit Harington is known from the role of swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone out and criticized the stereotype of the macho hero and says such roles on film often make young men think they have to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that something has gone wrong and wondered how to attack the problem of "toxic masculinity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married fellow Game of Thrones player Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he was very concerned about the topic.
“It worries me a lot at the moment – where did the masculinity go wrong?” he said.
“How have we raised men in view of the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that TV may be partly to blame for the increase in "toxic masculinity" due to the highly masculine roles.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What is conveyed on TV and on the street, what makes young boys feel that they must cultivate this particular side of being a man?
I think that’s one of the really big questions of our time – how can we change that?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also admits that he will not make any forerunner or successor of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard’s True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife during the filming, so that way something good came out of it – my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, whom Kit's character Jon Snow is in love with, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV/AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, health officials said.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases are transmitted via sex, marking a change from before.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China by infection through blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way is now closer to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year by year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Much of the disease infection is due to insufficient protection during sex in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of a measure to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies co-worker leaked data on Republican senators, snorts of “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
House of Representatives member Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that members of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat assured of the allegations was made by "ultraconservative" commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies and more reprehensible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on the abuse allegations against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came a little after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was traced to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of Waters' staff, according to Hill.
“This unsubstantiated allegation is completely false and an outright lie,” Waters continued.
“The members of my staff – who have had their identities, personal data and security compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations – had absolutely no responsibility for the leaking of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an outright lie.”
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including by former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is aggressive," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be aggressive.
Don't let them defend you.
They must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
They need to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too aggressive during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate working to remove Waters in the midterms, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great – if that’s true,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted "relevant authorities and police about these false allegations".
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they are held responsible for all acts that are destructive and dangerous to each of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again – Rowan Atkinson in a spy parody
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit allusions in all new films with a British slant and it seems to be applicable to this revival of the parody franchise Johnny English action comedy – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic self-sacrifice about how obviously hopeless we are become the nation’s new export product?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his bulging eyes and rubber face has been renewed his license to mess it up for the second time – his name says more than anything that he is a clear and comic figure intended for territories with non-English speaking cinema audiences.
He is, of course, the silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a douche Mr Bean and a portion of that guy who contributes a single note in the fire-wagon-themed musical feature at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He is also originally based on the role Atkinson played in the long-forgotten TV ads for Barclaycard; the traveller and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
There are some great moments in the last Johnny English flight.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades carved his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy comes into its own, but the humor feels rather anaemic and oddly superfluous, especially now that the "serious" brands like 007 and Mission Impossible are willingly off feature comedy.
The humor seems to be more aimed at children than adults, and to me Johnny English's fads are not as inventive and pointed as the silent film sounds in Mr Bean.
The current premise is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all the British agents in the field, to the horror of the watchful agent – a lamentable small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last straw for a prime minister, a pompous and dejected figure who is already undergoing a complete crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing a very good job with this pretend-Teresa-May role, but the script doesn’t give her much to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform that since every active spy has been revealed, she must bring in some among the retired.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a snobby establishment, but gives unofficial instruction in secret intelligence. There are some funny sequences here, when English offers a rocking academy for spying activity.
English is snatched back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with his old, troubled helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, spliced with a submarine commander, a hysterical upper-class lady role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin style of messing everything up on mission for the Queen are back, where they confront Olga Kurylenko's amazing femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is seduced by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s cyber problems: the insidious Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their journey with farcical sidesteps: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant, wreaking havoc as they hide aboard Volta’s luxury yacht; and English unleashes sheer anarchy as he attempts to use a VR headset to make himself known in Volta’s house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but even so gracious and noisy it is so much like children's TV with the whole thing.
Pretty mediocre, all of it.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets to use his talent?
Labour denies drawing up plans to let Britons work four-day weeks, but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party is to consider a radical plan that will give the British four-day working week – but get paid for five.
The party apparently wants business leaders to spend savings on the revolution with artificial intelligence by giving workers an extra day of the week off.
This will result in the employees receiving a three-day weekend, at the same time as receiving the same salary.
Sources say the idea fits into the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favor of workers.
The unions support the transition to four-day weeks so that workers can also enjoy the benefits of the new economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition that fits with the party’s desire to allow the pendulum to swing in favor of the workers – in addition to the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. The Green Party promised four-day weeks during the campaign before the 2017 general election.
However, the idea is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day week is not the party's policy, and is not something that is being considered by the party".
Labour spokesman John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "faceless directors" and "profit makers" of public service providers.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies are in danger of not regaining their entire shareholding because a Labour government can make "deductions" based on perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and set up employee funds to transfer 10% of the equity of private sector companies to the employees, which could receive an annual dividend of 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' about the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh may cause them to change their mind
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency's findings could cause some Republican senators to change their minds.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley of "60 Minutes" asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open to it than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said at the start of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked, “Did you?”
He was determined, obstinate, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, appears to be carved in stone.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it had to be a startling discovery," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett vigorously denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people she mentioned couldn’t confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don’t think anything new will change that.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it helped fight poverty?
This Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an impressive roster of stars to perform and an equally impressive mission; eradicating world poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh year, will have thousands of people flocking to the vast lawn of Central Park, not only to experience sizes like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the event’s real goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to fight poverty by getting more people to work actively against poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you’re willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a variety of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or in other meaningful ways raising awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when there are only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to get people to fight for change, or just another case of so-called “clicktivism” – that people feel they are contributing big by signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, with a wealth of different targets.
They say these actions have helped get world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will improve the situation of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group was able to refer to 390 engagements and announcements as a result of their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funding has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main engagements are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and entrepreneurs based in the UK who are to "help children exploit their full potential", and pledged to give Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador for the Power of Nutrition.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in the UK to get better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition measures.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, “what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
The global citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the important civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we stand stronger together.
Janet Jackson, of Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists performing at this year's event in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy as 'blockade' to prevent Russian energy exports
Washington may "if necessary" resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including in the Middle East, revealed U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially when operating at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they’re in the Middle East is because they want to negotiate energy just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flank of Europe,” he said.
And according to the spokesperson, there are always ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States has the ability through the Navy to make sure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, block to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that profiles itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's ways of interacting with Russia and Iran, noting that they are by far the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel," he said, referring to Russia as "one trick pony" with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statements came after the Trump administration has been on a round trip to bolster the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe. They want to replace Russia, by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
Employees of the Trump administration, including the president himself, therefore tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” project of the Northern European gas pipeline 2, which according to Trump made Berlin Moscow’s “prisoner.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Northern European gas pipeline, which is to double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is motivated only by economic reasons and is an example of fraudulent competition.
"I think we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The US position has met resistance from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitments in the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, BDI, has asked the US to stay away from the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have big problems with third countries interfering in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, the head of BDI after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will ‘think seriously’ about her 2020 presidential candidacy, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "think seriously" about whether she would run for president after the midterm elections.
During a voter meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she will run.
"It's time for women to get to Washington and fix the shackled government, and that includes a woman at the top," she said.
"After November 6th, I will be thinking seriously about whether to run for president."
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the voter turnout, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm worried to the limit about what Donald Trump is doing to democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll released on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe she should run in 2020.
58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a poll from the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidacy.
The poll showed higher support for former Governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidacy and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and the Vermont senator, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points out Track Palin's PTSD during Trump's voter turnout
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after enlisting in Sept.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after coming home, I have in common with other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and some of the vulnerability our soldiers bring," she told the crowd at a Donald Trump voter event in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Calling the arrest “the elephant in the room,” Palin said of his son and other war veterans: “They come home a little changed, they come home hardened, they come home wondering if this is respect for what their soldier comrades and pilots and all other members of the military have contributed to the country.”
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence on a woman, clustering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support testing new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal test of a new policy in the United States that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or home violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. presented an orientation from amicus curiae (friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal police has not been made public.
She claimed her partner "and his violent gang member sons" abused her, but officials in the United States rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The district attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations that have pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a decision in 2014 by the Court of Appeals for Immigrants that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores many decades of state, federal and international law".
“Federal law requires all asylum claims to be determined by the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a prohibition is contrary to that principle,” said the brief from amicus curiae.
The lawyers further argued in the briefing that the policy that denied immigrants access harms the U.S. economy, saying they are highly likely to become entrepreneurs and "contribute with necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political view," Sessions said in the June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all the problems – even all the serious ones – that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue operation in Palu – death toll doubles in search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“It was very exciting,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforts her fever-stricken son at an evacuation center in the collapsed city of Palu.
“You see ambulances all the time.
Clean water is scarce.”
One could see residents coming to broken homes and searching through water-damaged possessions in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were damaged in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, became overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, are sitting outside Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing severe aftershocks.
He gets tears in his eyes as he recounts how it felt when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to get to safety.
I was squeezed by the wall that collapsed, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife calling for help, and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of ‘harassment’ with ‘propaganda ads’
A week after a public Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American newspaper that juxtaposed the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the appendix China Daily paid to move into the Des Moines Register – the top-selling newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, an accusation China rejects.
Trump’s allegation that Beijing was trying to influence the U.S. election marked a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China, U.S. officials said.
While it is normal for foreign governments to use ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has resulted in rounds of new tariffs on each other’s imports.
China's tariffs early in the trade war were to hit export companies in states like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts report.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reader post in Sunday's Des Moines Register: "China is now stepping up harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press".
“By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting the freedom of speech and the open press that we enjoy in America to put a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“By contrast, at the newsstand on the street here in Beijing, you don’t find many dissenting opinions and don’t get to experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese about China’s problematic economic course, given that the media is under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added: “One of China’s biggest newspapers declined the offer to publish” his article, although he did not disclose which newspaper it was.
Republicans Scare Away Female Voters Before Midterm Election With Kavanaugh Fades, Analysts Warn
As many top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has had multiple sexual assault allegations leveled at him, analysts warn that they will have a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming local elections.
The sentiments surrounding this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already indicated that they want to move forward with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) proposal for an FBI investigation at the last second will be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women will not forget yesterday’s events – they will not forget tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters sang "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the halls of the Senate when the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to explode," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“People say it’s already been high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among female insecure voters in the suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who often don’t vote even though they dislike the president.”
Even before Ford's public testimony providing detailed description of the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts believed that it would be a counter-reaction if Republicans forced through the appointment.
"This has become a blissful mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the RNC (Republican National Committee), early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final approval or whether Kavanaugh is inaugurated – it’s also about the way the Republicans have handled this and how they’ve treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that promotes the election of Democratic candidates, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided over who to believe in in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a small majority in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov survey found that 41% of respondents were completely or fairly convinced of Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they were completely or fairly convinced of Kavanaugh’s portrayal.
In addition, 38% said they were quite or completely convinced that Kavanaugh was lying during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's move, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford in addition to at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week, stating that Kavanaugh drunkenly assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed her genitals to her while they were at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web creator plans to launch a new internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
On Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who has access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose is "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the start.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to let people create their own “online personal data repository” or a POD.
It can include contact lists, work lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal data storage online is that it is entirely up to the user who should have access to that type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is for the company to provide resources, process and relevant expertise to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted developers to work on the project and a bunch of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce something completely new, which will cause their business models to be completely rebranded overnight.
“We don’t ask for your permission.”
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the debate on net neutrality.

Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Victoria Cross Recipient of World War I
The only minister of the Church of England to be awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Vann was awarded the honour on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellenglice and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he was awarded the highest British military award.
A memorial stone was uncovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said there was a "great symbolism" in that the stone would be uncovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September – “through very thick fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.”
Later, he crashed towards the line of fire and led the line "with great courage" forward before storming a field gun single-handedly and knocking out three of the detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – just a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but something that makes me humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Corps.
Michael Vann said he "felt very honoured to play a part in the parade", adding: "The bravery of a real hero is demonstrated by the support coming from many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the martial arts show Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa gris
Imagine staying up all night to watch the packed Bellator 206, only to discover that you’re not getting to see the main game.
The San Jose contestant made it through 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, viewers in Britain were sitting giggling when the picture suddenly showed Peppa pig.
Some were less impressed after staying awake until early morning to watch the match.
A fan on Twitter described the transition to the children's program as "a kind of sick joke".
"It's government regulation that it's not appropriate to broadcast such programs at 6:00 a.m., so they had to put over to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa pig, yes!".
Bellator's CEO, Scott Coker, said they will be working on the broadcast plan to include viewers in Britain in the future.
“I think we can figure that out with a view to the rematch,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday there, and we won’t be able to resolve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me - when we put over, there were a lot of messages going back and forth, and they weren't exactly of the friendly sort.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't that, it was a government thing.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We want to reduce from six to five games – which we usually send – and we tried to go far for the fans, but tipped over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior in terms of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn’t until high school that he realized that “he wasn’t like anyone else.”
In the first program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he stood up for the rights of the gays to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The usual host of the traditional program, Kirsty Young, is supposed to be away for a few months due to illness.
Daley appeared a little lost on Laverne's first broadcast and said he felt "less valuable" than everyone else he grew up with because "it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls".
He said, “To this day, it is these feelings of being inferior and different that have been the real motivation and have me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he “was something,” he said, so he didn’t disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is a two-time bronze medalist in the Olympics and has become a high-profile LGBT ambassador. He used his participation at this year's Commonwealth Delegate in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he stands up because he feels lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man – filmmaker Dustin Lance Black of the United States, whom he met in 2013 – “surprised me.”
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age” – he attended his first Olympics when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had been changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about me winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than gold medals in the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked was if they had obtained tickets for London 2012 – since he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't live long enough to sit in the front row," he said.
“I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew this was what I’d been dreaming of all my life – diving in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, the best feeling ever,” he said.
It also inspired his first song choice – Proud by Heather Small – which meant a lot to him in the run-up to the Olympics and still gives him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 a.m. BST.
Mickelson selected for the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to get in shape if it is not to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial for the impressive 12th time, was benched by team captain Jim Furyk before Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he had so often been for the U.S., the five-time major-winner divides the day between being the cheerleader and working on his game on the rank in hopes of correcting what is scurrilous.
The 48-year-old never had the best swing, even at the peak of his career and is not in perfect shape for the tight Le Golf National course, where the long rough area is constantly penalizing stray strokes.
And if the pitch itself isn’t daunting enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 single games, get a successful start, Mickelson's game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expresses confidence in her husband, not that he could have said otherwise.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready the next day," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He is a Hall of Famer and has added so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite reached his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his participation added some intangible values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty and likes to make fun of others. He’s a great guy to have in the team room,” he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun trying against him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives a lot more than just the game."
European team captain Thomas Bjørn knows his big lead may soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a significant lead at the entrance to the last day’s Ryder Cup singles games can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but cared for the win by the smallest possible margin, 141x2-131x2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only barely," said Bjørn, photographed after watching Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone else on that team that this isn't over.
You'll give it all tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal and that is to try to win this trophy and that is where the focus is.
I’ve always said that I’m focused on the 12 players that are on our side, but we’re very aware of what’s on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Bjørn is very pleased with how his players have managed on the tough golf course and adds: “I couldn’t have done better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow, it’s the individual achievements that are at the center, and that’s something completely different.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there alone, your achievements as a golfer are tested to the fullest.
That’s the message that you need to convey to the players, that they need to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he also has to go out and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjørn, his opponent Jim Furyk will try to get his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the great upheavals of the last day. He was part of the winning team at Brookline before he ended up as a loser when Europe performed the "miracle at Medinah".
I remember every damn word of it," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had ravaged with his players at the entrance to the final day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to have a good start, like the one we experienced at Brookline, as we saw at Medinah.
When the momentum starts to move in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We arrange our setup accordingly and send the people out the way we feel. You know, we try to create something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the fight and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top fight, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the upper half of the player order.
"I bet on this group of men in that order because I think it stands the whole way," Bjørn said of his choice of single players.
Germany's new warship delayed once again
German Navy's newest frigate was supposed to have been completed in 2014 to replace old Cold War warships, but that won't happen until at least next year due to failing systems and galloping costs, local media reported.
The completion of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the leadership of the brand new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit which quoted a military spokesperson.
The vessel was supposed to have been handed over to the Navy in 2014, but the major problems after delivery pursued the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class navy ordered all the way back in 2007, will replace the old frigates of the Bremen-class.
It has been agreed that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to use the latest frigates for up to two years away from the home port.
However, constant delays mean that the advanced warships – they were said to give Germany strength at sea – will already be out of date by the time they are put into service, Die Zeit reports.
The fateful F125 frigate made headlines last year, when German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of important "software and hardware defects" that rendered the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important since vessels in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older frigates in the Bremen class.
It was also revealed that the ship has an enormous predominance, which reduces performance and limits the Navy's ability to make upgrades in the future.
The 7000-ton heavy "Rhineland-Palatinate" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class that were used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the price tag on the entire project – including crew training – has also started to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros – from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems surrounding the new frigates are particularly significant in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German government’s defence committee, confirmed that the navy is in fact “running out of usable ships.”
The official said the problem has escalated over time because old ships were decommissioned, but there were no new vessels.
He regrets that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the Navy.
The National Trust eavesdrops on the secret life of bats
New research carried out at a Scottish Highlands country estate will reveal how bats use the landscape in search of food.
There is hope that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help design future conservation measures.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and dwarf bats as well as brownling and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also perform mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Experts' sound analyses of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat calls and which species do what.
Then, a habitat map and a report will be prepared to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will be included in the decision on which measures to introduce, such as planting pastures and how to best care for the forest for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and construction work that affects breeding sites and habitat restriction.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, the same with flypaper and certain chemically treated building materials as well as attacks from house cats.
Bats are not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, they have more use for their ears than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation to find insects and obstacles on the road as they fly.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten skilled experts who regularly carry out surveys, mapping of breeding sites and sometimes rescue work.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only separate bat reserve at Threave land estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threave, we have the perfect area for bats,” he says.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.”
He emphasizes the importance of mapping the bats before performing maintenance on a property since unwitting destruction of a single breeding site can kill up to 400 females and young, and perhaps wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are protected, and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disturb them, or destroy their breeding grounds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help in the work.
She says: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species, we simply don’t know how the populations are doing.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers want to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape allegations against him as "fake news" and says that people "wish for fame" by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is accused of paying her $375,000 in the aftermath for keeping a close eye on the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking on a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo dismissed the allegations as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," says five times the winner of the Golden Ball into the camera.
“They want fame by using my name.
It's common.
They want fame by giving my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and I’m fine,” the footballer adds with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an unacceptable representation of suspicions in the private sphere," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the soccer player would claim compensation for “reputation damages to an extent equivalent to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious breaches of privacy in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at a suite in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents submitted to the Clark County, Nevada district court.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99% a good person" who was let down by the "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken in hospital, but later they settled out of court because she was "life afraid of revenge" and was also worried about "being publicly hanged".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to set the settlement aside because she is still traumatized after the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of transferring from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged abuse, and this summer moved to Italian Juventus on a contract worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain 'will mourn forever' over losing automakers
Britain “will mourn forever” if it loses its post-Brexit world leadership status, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, they would temporarily halt production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of delayed border crossing in the event of a no-deal Brexit could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will, in my view, see production at our factory halt,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive at Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without a deal in terms of how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close the Mini plant at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is what automakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on an ‘on-demand’ basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a delay at the border, which the industry says could result in delays and a shortage of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day's stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and thus production will stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s Brexit plan for further relations with the EU is “precisely designed to avoid such checks at the border.”
"We need to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that will allow us, as I say, to not only enjoy success at the moment, but that we seize this opportunity," he said on the BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The message, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production will be halted, but warned that increasing costs in the long term will reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually result in job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a union leader at the factory, said that members are becoming increasingly concerned: “My experience suggests that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's fateful meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "suspended for another week" as the fight around Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will dismiss the deputy attorney general or not, thus threatening Mueller’s independence, has been fueling speculation in Washington for many months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of recording the talks with Trump and attempting to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month, he went to the White House, while it was reported that he was resigning voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations in New York, would take place Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid it clashing with the Senate Judiciary Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “A date for the meeting was not set; it could be this week, but I figured it could be a week’s delay because of everything that happens with the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I’m always keen to keep the press updated.”
Some journalists will dispute that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Program host Chris Wallace asked about the cause.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to dislike of TV reporters' "self-indulgence", although she added, "I don't disagree with the fact that they are self-serving".
Then she hinted that contact between Trump and the press will become more frequent.
“The president is doing more questioning than any previous president,” she said, adding without providing evidence: “We’ve looked at the numbers.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but "if the press gets the chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it will certainly be better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, and you’ve seen that we’ve done it often in the last few weeks, and it’s going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open events or press conferences when visiting key figures.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible cause, when he did a solo race and at times had a strange behavior in front of a crowd of reporters.
Health secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit concerns
The Health Secretary has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and a desire for them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish MP, sent a letter less than six months before the UK was due to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of applying for a residence and work permit for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “Negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have taken place throughout the summer and are expected to land on a solution in the fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I understand that this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
I will therefore repeat now how much I value the efforts of each individual employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and expertise that empowers and enhances the work of the healthcare community for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we sincerely hope you will stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Defending Tennessee State Tigers player Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ reported in the Tennessean newspaper.
Tennessee States head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the first half was over.
"He came out on the sidelines and sort of just collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before placing him on a stretcher and taking him behind for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is "no information on the type/extent of the injury yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transitioning from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before finishing the game, giving a total of 18 tackles for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. According to new Tory plans, the extra money will be used to help the homeless
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's plan to attract young voters
The document fee increase will be collected from those who do not pay tax in the UK
Finance ministry experts expect it to raise up to 120 million pounds a year – to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the UK – and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn's plan to attract young voters with the promise of offering more affordable housing and hitting high-income groups.
The document tax increase will be imposed on people and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money will strengthen the government’s efforts to remedy the homeless’s situation.
The profit – which is in addition to the current document fee, including the higher tariff introduced two years ago on residential second and home purchase for rental – can be as much as 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to bring in up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by people who do not live in the UK. This drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get their foot in the housing market.
Many affluent areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost cities” because of the many foreign buyers who mostly reside outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in document fees to help more young people own their own housing.
He accused large construction companies of keeping house prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded Theresa May reject quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain's "shameful housing policy".
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a startling series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to unfounded evictions.
He also wants to give city councils more power to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream – that life should improve with each new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it may not be as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and also foreign-based companies, to buy homes as it is for hard-working British citizens.
For many people, the dream of owning their own home has become far too distant, and the unworthy situation of the homeless persists.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old Scotsman welcomes the challenge of reviving the club in the northeast, which currently holds third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I got a B-cap and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I was often with my father and saw Scotland at Hampden as a child, and there’s always something that draws me back.
That opportunity, however, would only come if I succeeded in the club management."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he was not anxious to succeed such established names at the big club, and has previously declined advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at the moment will be measured by whether I can get the club back in the Premier League".
From the structure and facilities of this club, they undoubtedly belong to the Premier League," he said.
It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably only consider myself successful here if I get the club back there."
Ross has only been in charge for three years, following a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month short appearance on the Hearts coaching staff.
Then he helped Alloa to recover from relegation to the Third Division and helped St Mirren from the brink of relegation to win the championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalls when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
“I really thought management was the right thing for me, more right than playing.
It sounds strange since I did well, made a reasonable income out of it and experienced some nice highlights.
Football can be tough.
There are many things you need to get through on a weekly basis.
I go through it in terms of stress and pressure in the job, but the management feels just right for me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do. It feels like the most comfortable thing I’ve ever known in my adult life.”
You can hear the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30, on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
Perfect time for a pint is 5.30pm on Saturdays, survey shows
This summer’s heat wave has boosted revenues for Britain’s hard-pressed pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw a 2.7% increase in revenue in July – while restaurant revenues fell 4.8%, the figures show.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA, who summarized the figures, said: “Continued sunshine and England’s unexpectedly long participation in the World Cup made July follow a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when pubs went up 2.8%, except restaurants were hit even harder.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant sales in June only got worse in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had by far the best result, but an increase that was stronger like-for-like than that restaurants went down.
Pubs with food service also had difficulty with the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for the rastaurant drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted to drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, sales increased by 6.6% that month, with food service declined 3%".
Paul Newman, an analyst from the hotel and restaurant industry RSM, said: “These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sports and social events are still the most important factors when it comes to sales in the outdoor market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups are still struggling, and a 4.8% year-on-year revenue drop will be particularly painful on top of ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food service companies, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide a long-awaited respite.”
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in rollouts of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the industry revenue controller for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, collects and analyzes the results of 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of 9 billion pounds, and is the established industry standard.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children – some of whom are only 11 years old – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students uncovered pages of "fake Insta".
The news has raised concerns about the sharing of sexual content.
20% of students said they have a “main account” that they show their parents.
One in five children – some of whom are only 11 years old – create social media accounts that they keep hidden from the adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed a rapid growth in “fake Insta” accounts – a reference to photo sharing sites on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about sexual content being shared.
20% of students said they had an innocent “main account” that they show to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager urging others to “rape me.”
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Principals' Conference (HMC) for Private Schools revealed that 40% of 11- to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC chief executive Mike Buchanan said: “It’s scary that so many young people are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “Sportsman’s Voice” on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics and has a non-executive role at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete, and chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those leading the sport to gain insight into her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and worldwide athletics community, and we are confident that athletes in Scotland will benefit from getting her onto the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to serve as a voice for athletes, and I hope I have a lot to contribute to guiding the sport in Scotland".
The American won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and has a total of four Olympic golds. She is now a regular BBC expert, and after she had a transient ischemic attack, she was unable to walk.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago today I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I want to recover and to what extent.
It’s been hard work, but I’m totally fine again and have learned to walk again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
Breast pump ad comparing mothers to cows splits opinion online
A breast pump company has split public opinion online with an ad comparing nursing mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump to be worn close to the body,” Elvie, the technology-based consumer goods company, released a fresh and flirtatious, music video-inspired ad to show the freedom the new pump gives active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows to a song with, among other things, the following lyrics: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see any tail" and "In case you didn't realize, this isn't udder, it's my tits".
The chorus continues: “Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my buns.”
However, the ad, which is published on the company's Facebook page, has created a storm on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many saying it beautifies the “cruelties” of the dairy industry.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth.”

Another commented: “Obviously traumatic for both mother and baby.
But hey, why not use them to advertise for a breast pump for moms who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another added, “What a failed ad.”
Others defend the ad. One woman admitted that she thinks the song is "incredibly funny".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd love to have one if I'm still breastfeeding.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
“It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Another commented: “This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who pump (often in the workplace or toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an ad that hails or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely quiet, has no wires or hoses and gets a nice place in a nursing bra, allowing women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, Partner and ECD at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all the challenges, while at the same time showing in an entertaining and recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom the new pump provides.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to a Texas border tent camp
The number of migrant children arrested has skyrocketed even though the monthly border crossing has remained relatively stable, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to place children with supporters.
Traditionally, most supporters have themselves been undocumented immigrants, and have been afraid to ruin their own chances of staying in the country by stepping forward and claiming a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults in the household would have to file fingerprints and that the data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people applying to be a supporter of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Nearly 80% of people who are either supporters or members of the household of supporters are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
The officers are trying to deal with the children more quickly and introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within one month of being arrested, rather than 60 days which was the previous standard, according to reception workers.
Many will be presented via video conference instead of meeting in person to bring their case for a residence permit before an immigration judge.
Those who are considered unjustified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in custody, the greater the risk of anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to reception workers and reports that have emerged in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns have grown at a larger facility like Tornillo, where children who struggle more easily are overlooked because of the facility size.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without them having sufficient time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can amplify trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish “occupational powers” to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that the foreign forces were staying illegally on Syrian soil under the guise of fighting terrorism and "will be treated accordingly".
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million are on the run.
He said Damascus will continue to “carry on this holy fight until we have cleared all Syrian territories” for both terrorist groups and “all foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, Moualem said conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused "certain Western countries" of "spreading irrational flight" that causes the refugees to stay away.
"We have approached the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
They are politicizing what is really a purely humanitarian situation.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the rebels' last major defense position at Idlib has created an opportunity to push for political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement averted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including fighters from Al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, who "will be wiped out".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes he can soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of state and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem put forward conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump wants to win another term
By that logic, Trump would have won re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, impeachment and scandal end the presidency before that time.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!”
At the moment, there is no sign of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, ratings for prime time have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC “The Rachel Maddow Show” has topped the cable ratings with a whopping 3.5 million viewers on nights of big news stories.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to because we don't understand anything," said Neal Baer, host of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a noted comedy creator and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, “Because he makes me laugh.”
There's an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the actions taking place in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the health of the global economy.
Withdrawal is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you go to great lengths to be an enlightened human being when you sit down for six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward’s use of “dives in background material” for the book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s leather jacket with ostrich feathers worth $15,000 (“a garment lined with hubris,” said the Washington Post) and the aftermath of Stormy Daniels’s colorful description.
I don’t want to watch Super Mario anymore.
"One of the things he does that makes it look like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, general manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump show's varying cast and daily twist on the plot (struggle with the NFL, shame rose Kim Jong-un).

When I met Fleiss this week, it was 27°C and sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he caged in and watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not break free, not when Brett Kavanaugh is going to meet the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court of the United States is at stake.
"I remember when we made all the crazy programs in the old days and people said this is the end of Western civilization," Fleiss said.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right".

Money from outside pours into the smoothest midterm elections of the House of Representatives
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th district is experiencing a surge of money following a reshuffle of a congressional district that ended with two sitting representatives fighting for the same seat.
This newly-arrived suburban district of Pittsburg is running with Democratic Representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a by-election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania's 12th district, which greatly overlaps the new 17th district.
The map was redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were an unconstitutional manipulation of the constituencies in favor of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive race for campaign funding between the largest party funding groups, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a closely followed by-election for Pennsylvania's 18th district to Congress last March.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a small lead.
U.S. Considered Penalties Against El Salvador for Supporting China, Then Pulled the Threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to recall U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the ministry's spokesperson, in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed punitive measures, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials postponed a top-level conference focused on security and economic growth to follow up a similar gathering last year that was considered a step forward in the effort to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, officials in the top administration made it clear they wanted the conference to continue, halting any plans for punitive action against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, to demonstrate the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, the diplomat said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new tough messages or punitive measures from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations under the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
The next nail in the coffin could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, for which there is now very solid evidence in public documents.
Mueller is also reportedly expanding the investigation into whether Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia in interfering in our elections.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would be held accountable in that body, amid preparations to meet voters again and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertain factors, and I don’t mean to say that Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor for his counterparts in Europe.
There must be choices made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers stood ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had stood up to him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around such tipping points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or inhibited.
The Americans are facing several of these tipping points now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in rough weather ever since this newspaper reported that he suggested last year's secret wiretaps of the president and speculated that he was unfit to be president.
Rosenstein says The Times' presentation is incorrect.
“How will we react if the recent FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is approved by the Supreme Court despite credible assault charges and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we do not pass those tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, because of the experience I got in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me off to light the Sabbath candle on the table with the swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season in the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone to accomplish bigger things.
"It was a good point for us since Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game and thought we could do something and we got one point.
Maybe we could have nodded in at the end, but the draw was probably a decent result.
They were better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday is going to be a big night in Europe.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last game, but with the home crowd behind, I am sure we can stand on and get a positive result.
Last year was absolutely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the replacements at the club itself, but there is a good feeling now.
The team is good and the guys are enjoying themselves; the training is good.
Hopefully we can stand on now, put last season behind us and get it done."
Women lose their sleep due to fear of retirement
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, few spoke to their family about it.
Around half of the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to the kids about it.
"People want to be cared for by someone in the family, but they do nothing to make that call," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t say what you want well in advance.
Discuss with the counselor and the family where and how the care should be given. Such choices can be of great importance in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor: The advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for your expenses.
Long-term care financing options can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover those expenses, or self-assurance with your own assets – if you have enough money.
Prepare your legal documents: Get rid of legal problems right away.
Get a health authority in place by appointing a person you trust to keep track of your medical care, and make sure that your health care professionals will comply with your wishes should you be prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving someone power over your finances.
You choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you can’t do it yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parents are in a medical emergency and are on their way to hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down the details in a chart so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just the economy that’s at stake – who are the doctors?” asked Martin.

Who will take care of the dog?

Man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with air rifles when he was on his way home after an evening out.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as an "unmotivated act".
The victim did not see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Communication is out of order, and rescue workers have been unable to obtain information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region below provincial level, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of Sulawesi's economy, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's emergency relief administration.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ocean's seismic Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the south of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, triggering a tsunami that struck the south coast, killing nearly 700.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that devastated dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as humans were reminded of the ravages of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but over 100 were killed by coincident buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29 years old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, clustering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska state police.
According to the police report, he allegedly took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged abuse.
Palin is being detained in Mat-Su detention center and is being arrested for an unsecured promissory note worth $500, KTUU reported.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he pleaded "not guilty, absolutely" when asked how he stood on the guilt issue, the network reported.
Palin is confronted with three Class A offenses, meaning he can be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report the alleged assault.
The case is being heard in Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, clustering with the report of domestic violence and for possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD after service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: several hundred killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and has destroyed many thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just off central Sulawesi located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulated on social media showing the outbreak.
Several hundred people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami thundered across the beach.
Federal prosecutors rarely seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not been exercised in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, cutting down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and caused serious bodily harm on purpose, according to notice of intent to seek the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for possible capital punishment, according to the case document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury slammed the 22-point indictment, including eight charges of extortion-related murder, in the face of Saipov, normally used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and vehicle wreckage.
The attack required "significant planning and intent", the prosecutor said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "horrible, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injuries, property creations and losses for the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", states the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York filed a case that could provide the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to carry out espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty after the indictment on 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the publicly appointed defenders of Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a confession and life in prison without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today during a demonstration at the Tory Conference.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians should “feel the pressure” from the Eurosceptics – when one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested that he be put in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that Britain "would have been wiped out" now if Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge for May to reconcile her deeply divided ranks has been underscored by the pro-Remain Tories who took part in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is fighting to keep his Brexit plan on track against attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she will go ahead with trying to reach a deal with Brussels despite the setback – forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos”.
Bone told the Solihull protesters that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a member and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will stand for Brexit, but we must reject the Brexit plan".
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in two world wars to become subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The claim that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely wrong.”
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the demonstration and told reporters: “I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Brexit plan is unpopular with the public. The opposition is not going to vote for it. It is unpopular with the party and with our activists, who are actually the ones who are treading the streets and getting us elected in the first place.
Reject the Brexit plan and start listening".
In a direct message to May, she added: “Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage stated that politicians would be "feeling the pressure" if they thought about betraying the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"This is now about the trust between us – the people – and the politicians," he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to let them know that they will not get away with it.”
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to let our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
We are mobilising the people’s army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.”
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before having a two-hour political rally in the centre of the city.
A small number of activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the launch of the group this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with a party app when the conference started.
“These are the people who tell us they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “consider seriously running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about the future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for reelection in November against Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, who was vice chairman of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She has been at the center of speculation about whether she will run against Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with electors, who have used the town hall format since Trump became president.
One participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time for "women to get to Washington to fix our defective government, and that includes a woman at the top".
Arrested after LSU's Sims was killed in a shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Police in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, age 20, in a news conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a man observed on the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was at the scene carrying weapons. He admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Chamber.
Sims was a two-meter tall youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 starts last season. His average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton aims for world title after team order gives him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' stable order would play a major role in the race.
From pole, Bottas got off to a good start and nearly swept Hamilton off the field while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove in to the depot first and allowed Hamilton to continue driving in the rear of the main field, which should have been crucial.
Mercedes made a pit stop a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove himself up after some pushing with the wheels which caused the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the inside free after a double pass to defend in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the field and came in at number seven at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he led for much of the race as he lay on the wheels to try to get a quick finish and overpower Kimi Raikkonen who was at number four.
He eventually came by the depot on the 44th lap, but was unable to increase the pace of the remaining eight laps and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It’s a difficult day because Valtteri did a fabulous job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me through.
The team has done a fabulous job to get a good two-span," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein during a political event on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at an event in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was going on in the Senate shows that people are “malicious, nasty and speaking untrue.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you experience the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and awful and speak untrue,” he said.
“When you look at disclosures and leaks and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
I haven't done that."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Do you remember her answer... you leaked the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked."
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked...no, we didn't leak," he added, with an imitation of the senator's voice.
Feinstein received the letter with detailed information about the allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"She told me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she requested."
But her denial was not graciously addressed by the president, who during the party event on Saturday evening commented: “I’ll tell you one thing, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his continued defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, the president hinted that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take back power by all necessary means.
You see the madness, the evil, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get the power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants early received a two-goal lead via shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized for the home team before Dwyer restored the lead for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the win.
It was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come behind after they beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the third meeting of the season between the teams, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with help from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford retired the game when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what became a frantic opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt added up to Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants had the lead at halftime when he took his second goal for the night at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard equalised once again with a masterful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the game late in the second half, and he secured the win with the team's fives halfway into the final round.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, are playing at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure hundreds of air passengers escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as right after he died and ensured that a plane that had hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks continue to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after his colleagues had fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesperson Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts broke when we heard that,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach several thousand, and the country's disaster response agency reports that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The numbers are expected to rise further since many bodies are still trapped under the rubble and many have not been possible to reach," said spokesman for the body, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six-meter-high waves have demolished Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “All the time you see ambulances picking up casualties.
There is a lack of clean water.
Minimarkets are being robbed everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working feverishly to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Air Niugini reports missing after plane crashes in lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, now says that one man is missing. They previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that as of Saturday afternoon, there was one male passenger they did not have an overview of.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request for more details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and the condition of all was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just off the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others were able to wade through waist-deep water to the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said the airmen were panicking and yelling, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to repair a jetty also aided in the rescue effort by using an inflatable boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank about 30 feet below the water's surface.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network suggests that 111 people have died in crashes involving PNG-registered aircraft in the last twenty years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyst lays out timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors closed the procedure Saturday in a new trial for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile prints to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobiles showing Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to what he had claimed earlier, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same place as Chambers's phone during the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness stand Saturday, claiming he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in the trailer for Sanford that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my trailer was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile transcripts suggest they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Telli's calls, contact details, and messages to and from Chambers deleted from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case would be left to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is community-engaged hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from its origins with political messages to addressing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make community-engaged hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a new resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York childminder sues couple for dismissal after 'racist' message
A babysitter in New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from her mother, who complained that she was "yet another black person".
The pair deny that they are racist, comparing the lawsuit to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up for the first day of work in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEI Another BLACK PERSON," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the mistake, it was an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman who dismissed Maurice, by claiming that their fired babysitter, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for his one day of work and was then sent home with an Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal and demanding compensation of the order of $350 per day for the six-month, lodging-based arrangement she was promised, though without a contract.
“I wanted to show them that – hey, you just don’t do that,” she told the New York Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have struck back against the accusations that they are racist and say the dismissal of Maurice was the only right thing, since they felt they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist,” Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
“But would you have left your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
The comparison of the lawsuit with "extortion" says Plasco was due to the fact that his wife had only two months to term and was in a "very difficult situation".
Is that the kind of person you want to punish?
It's not very nice," added the stockbroker.
As the legal case progresses, the popular court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticize them for their behavior and attitudes.
Paddington's publisher feared readers wouldn't accept a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was supposed to be, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in someone else’s place when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It's really fun to know what we now know about Paddington's great success".
She says her father, who had worked as a cameraman at the BBC before he was inspired to write the children’s book by a small cloth bear, would have been delighted that his work had been turned down, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book’s publication was “bittersweet” after he passed away last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important family member" and adds that her father was secretly very proud of the success he achieved.
"He was a rather quiet man, and he was not a boastful person," she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child doing a feat: you’re proud of it even if it’s really not your fault.
I think he looked at Paddington's success a little bit that way.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to give the credit to Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone
Upon landing, her daughter had to be rushed to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors were working in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it looked bad, that he didn't think she would survive," said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got the phone call from Nad saying she was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll come to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medicine the doctors had given her to make her heart beat slowly lost its effect and left the system.
She died a while earlier and the organs in her body collapsed.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it happened.
I couldn’t scream because I was surrounded by people.
I really had to pull myself together.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers – who did not know about the ordeal she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I looked down all the time and tears flowed in a steady stream.
It’s hard to explain, but it was there on the plane that I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcards with grieving women to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up postcards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers follk can call for help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 years old when he suffered from depression and committed suicide when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to experience what I have to relive every day,” she says.
45-year-old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They said his smile could light up any room."
He quit his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was one of those who found him after he took his life.
Sharon says: “I worry all the time that there will be a contagion effect.”
Sharon made the cards "to tell people that there are people out there that they can go and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don’t sit by yourself – you need to talk to someone.”
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost Mark, her partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t tell me he was feeling down or depressed or anything,” she says.
“A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed the changed mood.
On Christmas Day, he was all the way in the basement – when the kids opened the presents, they didn’t make eye contact or anything.”
She says his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to fight their way through it: “It tears up a big hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to persevere and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI investigates
“I thought that if we could get some of what he asked for – a time- and scope-limited investigation – we might come to some agreement,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “falling apart” along entrenched party lines.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The reluctance was due to the timing.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, November 6 – if Republicans presumably do poorly, it will be significantly harder for them to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling around to senators and lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley there when she was the personal secretary of Bush.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, so Vice President Mike Pence can use his double vote and get him elected to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors “falls” under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker stated.
Park Byeong-seug, which refers to data from South Korea’s collection ministry, said there had been 1,127 defections last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park stated that stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices in human traffickers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented on it publicly.
Most defectors from North Korea are eventually offered citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China considers the defectors illegal migrants and not refugees and returns them by force.
Relations between the North and the South – which are technically still at war – have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks on the deadlocked negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they largely agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions there is no possibility that we will unilaterally dismantle first," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to sit on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he had a temper that made him unfit to sit on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the statements in an interview on Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved like that, she would have been called hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, sometimes almost shouting and crying when he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats on the committee and called the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony shows he cannot sit on the Supreme Court since it shows he is biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was approved and if the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say this – if he does not tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he is not only unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, but also in the court he sits in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abortion rights), since he is considered to be a conservative judge.
In the questioning, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overrule certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time to send a hysterical, biased person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it," Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
It is a righteous indignation, months and years in which the mind takes over, and she cannot get it out without weeping.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s weird, do you?”
She continues: “I got good help from a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said that she also cries when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, “you might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought that was wonderful.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for resentment in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs was in a male-dominated office. I started crying with inexplicable rage and was grabbed by the neck collar of an older woman – a cool boss that I had always been a little afraid of – who dragged me to a stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sorry and be happy because they were able to catch you.”
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had been working with Gary Hart when he ran for president.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to be cheating on his spouse aboard a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the election, Schroeder became very frustrated and thought there was nothing wrong with investigating the possibilities of running for president himself.
"It wasn't a thoughtful decision," she said with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last ones they needed were one more.
Some called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since it was closer to the end of the campaign, she lagged behind with the funding and vowed that she would not run if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of the supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she wonders.
When she gave her speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotion – gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration at the system that made it so difficult to collect money and to reach voters instead of delegates, as well as anger at sexism – that she collapsed in tears.
“You’d think I was having a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls how the press referred to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking what they would write on my grave.
“She was crying?”
How the US-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a rift between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The main escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, meaning tariffs on half of all goods imported into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has, of course, retaliated every time, most recently with a surcharge of five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match the U.S. attack for attack, and the world’s second largest economy probably won’t hoist the white flag with the first.
Getting Washington to step down means giving in to demands, but public submission to the United States would be far too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressure around the trade war with the U.S. could pay off China in the long run by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that start economic ripples in one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than the spectators have realized before," said Abigail Grace, a fellow researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help to restore the country, which has been devastated after more than 7 years of war.
Speaking at the UN’s National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,” he said.
The state continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now conducive to the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their everyday lives and their livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that there would be no conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup after beating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the throne when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjørn got the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled during much of the tournament, cut his tee-beats in the water at the par-3 16th hole, and had to see himself beaten by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant on all his rounds and became 1 of 4 golfers who have ever gone 5-0-0 since the tournament got its current design in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 and 4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup final.
With eight Ryder Cups behind him, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the tournament's most-winning European of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It's been a rough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas picked me out and had faith in me.
I'm very, very happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help," said an emotional Garcia after the European win.
He hands over the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles games on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods – I followed that man closely growing up,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career points in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest golfers ever, who has won 14 major titles, only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf with high precision throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk stated after a disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There were moments this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and will look to the future.
I love these 12 guys and I’m proud to be their team captain.
You just have to take your hat off.
We were beaten.”
