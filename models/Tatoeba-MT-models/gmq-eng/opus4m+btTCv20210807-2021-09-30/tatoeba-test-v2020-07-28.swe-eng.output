Put the cake on the table.
I know you're angry.
Do you need anything?
I want a pair of gloves.
That's exactly what I needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I'm already late.
Even Mom knows about it.
He should have done it already.
Room service, please.
Who were you talking to?
The boy took the cat's tail.
How do you know?
I got a lot of mosquito bite.
I'm unemployed.
This medicine will cure your cold.
Does this remind you of someone?
I would like to talk to Tom between four eyes.
He will fall for temptation.
The TV isn't working.
I can explain that.
She behaves like a child.
What does it look like?
Mary thinks she has superpowers.
I know all this.
Everyone needs to know.
After stopping, the train quickly accelerated.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to agree, but you can at least accept that there are people who have different opinions than you?
Tom shut down the book.
I'm the best.
English is hard, isn't it?
I can go to school in ten minutes.
Are you ready now?

At least it wasn't boring.
Can you freeze it?
Tom flashed with the full light.
Are you threatening me?
Tom's worried.
I used to like to come here.
This is not a fish.
Tom and Mary might not do what everyone says they did.
No one here is called that.
It's time to go.
All three men smiled.
Come sit down.
It'll have to do.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.

A squid has ten arms.
She didn't come before two.
I am.
That was very good.
Come and talk to me.

Where is she?
It feels really good.
Why do you like it?
What would you say if you were in this situation?
Give me three weeks.
The driver turned the wheel to the right.
I'm on the wind.

I'll do it.
We need to find it.
What's missing?
I can do it myself!
Don't worry.
She paid seven percent interest on the loan.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to kick you.
Can I think about it?
When did you see Tom?
It's not important!
Strange things happened on her birthday.
Anyone talking here Russian?
I drove the car.
I have great news.
Are we safe yet?
We tried to contact the other ship.
You'll die soon.
This is not good.
You're probably right.
Monday starts on Sunday.
It’s really not worth the effort.
“How old are you, I’m sixteen years old.
I have a steel blow.

I was loved.
Do you own a firearm?
He knows too much.
Here we are!
I came on the list.
How far for it?
Are we almost there?
All the doors in the house were closed.
Tom woke up when he heard someone knock on the door.
We think you should come in.
What were you drinking?
Tom was curious.
Can you swim?
Turn off the radio.
Sleep!
I already told you.
Which country do you come from?
I want ice cream.
You shouldn't go out.
Let me explain.
As I said, I was busy.
You don’t have to say anything if you don’t feel like it.
I made a bad mistake on the test.
Tom can't read.
You can't blame her for what she did.
How do they do that?
I live in Canton.
