AM in Wales is worried about “promising as a puckon”
Some AM, members of the Wales National Assembly, are confused with a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of Wales Parliament).
The proposal will, after plans, change the name of the National Assembly to Wales Parliament.
AM throughout the political spectrum is worried about being mocked.
An AM for Labour said his group was worried because “it rimming with Twp and Pwp”
For readers who cannot Welsh: Twp means stupid in Welsh and pwp means Bais.
An AM for Plaid said the group was generally dissatisfied and has proposed other options.
A conservative wareader said his group is the “open” for the name change, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W is pronounced in Welsh like the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which currently compiles legislation for the name change, said: “The final decision on what members of the congregation should be called is clearly up to the members themselves,
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the title of AM, the Commission proposed Welsh Parliament Members (members of Wales Parliament) or WMP, but MWP received the greatest support in a public consultation.
AM clearly suggests other options, but problems in reaching a consensus can cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the change within a few weeks.
The legislation for the amendments also includes other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules for disqualification of an AM and the design of the committee system.
AM may vote on what they should be called when discussing legislation.
Macedonia conducts a referendum on the change of country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote if they change the country's name to \"Republic of North Macedonia\"
The referendum is an attempt to end a dispute that has been going on for decades with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has for a long time insisted that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly protested its attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the referendum on the name change and has said that he will ignore the outcome.
However, the members of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's silence when the churches in Harlem encounter problems
“Old people I’m talking to say there was a bar and a church on every corner of the past,” said Mr Adams.
There is neither, nor...
He said it is understandable that the bars disappear.
“People are hanging around in other ways these days,” he said.
“Bars are not like the area’s living room anymore, where people go on a regular basis...
In the case of the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough as far as the leaders expect and that, sooner or later, they will end up on the route again.
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with owner apartments filled by people who do not help remaining churches.
“The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white,” he said. “This will eventually lead to the closure of all the churches, because those who move into the apartments will probably not become members of the churches.
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black church that had a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black assembly led by pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or support black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when pastor Johnson’s assembly planned the renovation they also built the clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the music game the poor's bells.
The expert who played the watch game in July had a different name for it: “A cultural treasure — and an irreplaceable historical instrument —
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world’s first watch game to be played by a black musician — Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the larger watch game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
The events of the past few months at St. Martin's are a complex story with architects and entrepreneurs - some employed by the church's play, others by the Episcopal Foundation.
The Church Council, the governing body of the church consisting of laymen, wrote to the founder in July and expressed a concern that the foundation would \"try to transfer the cost - to the Council General Meeting, despite the fact that the General Meeting had not been involved when the foundation hired architects and entrepreneurs.
Some assembly members complained of a lack of transparency from the foundation.
Hair damages 13-year-olds who dive after lobsters in California
On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who appeared after lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack took place just before seven o'clock in the morning, near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shout for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy was just happy to have found a lobster, but then he realized that the boy screamed: “I’ve been bitten...
I've been bitten...
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he noticed that the entire key leg had been torn up.
“I cried to everyone to get out of the water. ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel said.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is stated to be critical.
It's not clear what a shark it was.
Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim suffered trauma injuries to his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's Gets Into Britain's Beauty Market
Sainsbury's takes on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department-like beauty walks with beauty specialists.
As part of a significant push into the UK beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the fall of the fashion and household markets, the larger beauty walks will be tested in 11 stores the country over and implemented in more stores next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the supermarket’s attempt to fill the shelves previously recorded by TVs, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said they intend to double their beauty range to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing selections from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space with marked areas, such as in stores like Boots.
The store chain also re-launches its boutique brand so that most of the products are vegan, which many young customers demand.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test stand in two Sainsbury's stores - the first stand opened in Croydon, southern London last week and the second one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend of buying smaller amounts of food every day in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their shops will look more and more like a department store in an attempt to fight cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl with more services and products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos stock in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitat stocks since they bought both chains two years ago, which according to them has increased the sales of food and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a facelift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a dispute on how the revenues from Boot's sales in the supermarket would be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, who owns Lloyd's Pharmacy chain, £125 million three years ago.
They argue that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxurious skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial manager, said: \"We have given our beauty walks a new look and a new feeling to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can advise customers.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all the needs, and with an appealing environment in agile places, we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping,
Peter Jones: After Holly Willoughby withdraws from the £11 million deal.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is “raising” that TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdraws from a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time for their brand Truly, with recreational clothing and accessories.
Their activities have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop.
This Morning representative, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle brand in the last minute - to focus on his new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones-Rassing - at a tense meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV favourite admitted that her new deal - worth up to £1.5 million - meant that she no longer focused on their brand Truly, with recreational clothing and accessories.
The business has compared with Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop and was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she left Truly on Instagram, Jones flew to one of her vacation homes.
One source said: “Truly was clearly Holly’s main priority.
It would be her long-term future for the coming decades.
Her decision to pull out shocked all who were involved.
No one could think it happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a stock of goods ready to be sold at the headquarters in Marlow.
Experts believe that this Morning representative’s decision to withdraw can cost the company several million because of significant investments in everything from pillows and light to clothing and the risk of further delays in launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Three-child mom Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Cape 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role of president in March.
The couple travel together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin’s TV production companies.
Willoughby is going to be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of \"I'm a Celebrity\" on ITV.
A source near Jones said last night: “We don’t comment on his business.
It's a tough snack, and then we'll be in love.
He joked that the media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider to be “inest worthy of a president” and that he was so positive about North Korea’s leaders.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a \"news anchor\" voice:
I haven't given up anything.
He said that Kim wants a second meeting after Trump hailed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step for North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been under way.
More than three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a “similar response” from the United States after North Korea’s first disarmament step.
He noted that instead, the United States continues sanctions intended to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his followers.
\"It's going great with North Korea,\" he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship.
He said that his attempt to improve Kim's relationship has had positive results - an end to rocket tests, released the hostages, and returned the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this packed arena, we would have about 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes destroy island in Indonesia, hundreds die
After the earthquake at Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population had lost their homes, it was not called an emergency, which is required for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they are not asking for international help, which complicates everything,” Ms Sumbung said.
Save the children gather a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear if foreign staff can work there.
Mr Sutopo, the natural disaster agency spokesman, said Indonesian officials evaluated the situation in Palu to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the aid work.
In view of Indonesia’s constant earthquakes, the country is still terribly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Tsunami protection has been built in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The absence of a tsunami warning sir in Palu, even though a warning had been issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even in perfect conditions, it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that has been anchored in Lombok to treat earthquakes victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia’s tired infrastructure in its campaign and has spent large sums on roads and trains.
However, insufficient funding has plagued Mr Joko's administration for next year's election.
Mr Joko is also pressured by continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christians and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, pills, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge announced last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute in Stamford Bridge, London on Saturday.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal when his team was behind by 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick at the far pole.
The attempt flew high across the target area towards the upper right corner of the network.
The ball finally fell over the hope of the Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended up in the net.
“I just tried to get in a position to access the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approach and didn’t think so much about it, but just kicked...
Chelsea led with 1-0 after the first half after a 25-minute goal from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker poured a passport back to Mateo Kovacic, spinning off near the middle field and sprinted to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go at the middle field.
Then he got a huge kick that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard ran from the defense and got the ball in the net at the far pole with a left foot kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea is opposed to Videoton in the Uefa Europa League in London at 15:00 on Thursday.
The death toll for tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll for the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people were reported to have stuck in the spills of buildings that crashed in the 7.5 earthquake that struck on Friday and triggered waves of up to six metres, the agency spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was full of sudden from buildings that were demolished.
Police arrest man, 32, suspected of murder after the woman is cut dead
A murder investigation started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 p.m. with knife wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested suspected of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who saw or heard something to come forward.
Criminal Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: \"We are at an early stage of the investigation, but I ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information essential to our investigation.
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the woman found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived at the place to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police inform the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but the police said no one can get into or get out of the building.
He became speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents of the building have been informed that it will take several hours for them to come back in.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared on the spot.
She says, “It’s so horrible — over and over again.
At 14:00, there were two police cars inside the lockdown and another just outside.
A number of police assistants were within the lockdown with an overview of the apartment building.
People with information are asked to send a DM to @MerPollCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell's latest victim of dispute over the rewriting of history
A ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick’s proposal for ‘badness’ and ‘try to write about history’.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be drawn into the ongoing debate on removing statues...
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
The wrong Cromwell might be sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the opinion of the 19th century and is part of historiography for a man who many think should still be praised.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than now, believe that Cromwell defended Parliament from pressure, in his case from the monarchy.
If this is a proper representation, it is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the mid-17th century has undoubtedly influenced the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person who represents one side of the matter.
His business as a lord protector also deserves to be praised and celebrated.
Killing a farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in Southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, who was only identified with his surname Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood in a path on the market in Liupanshui, the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig breeder prepares to inject vaccine into pigs in a pig bed on May 30, 2005 in Xining, the province of Qinghai, China.
He was reported to have travelled with his cousin from neighbouring province Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and found that the door of a nearby pig stia was open.
He said there was a large pig hen in the swindle with blood on his mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kilo of heavy pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and distorted,” said the cousin, who was identified with the surname Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to avoid more attacks while the police collected evidence on the site.
Yuan's family and those responsible for the market are reported to be negotiating compensation for his death.
It is rare that pigs attack people, but it has happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and severely damaged the man.
Ten years ago, a pig of 300 kilos pushed a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can serve as a “catalyst”
They're just playful.
They're very curious and they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect, he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa for widespread heavy rain to the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it travels over cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flooding rain to North Mexico and the Southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind speed of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at five EST in Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a train is formed across the Pacific Ocean and is traveling east towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the bay California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical humidity north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching tree will create widespread heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally 2.5-10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, clay flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5 to7.5 cm of rain per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5-10 cm of rain is expected in some places in the southwestern United States, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Suddenly floods are possible with rapidly impaired conditions due to the scattered tropical rain.
It is certainly not recommended that someone go into the desert on foot when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into flowing rivers and thunderstorms lead to strong local winds that blow around sand.
The approaching tree carries some locally strong rain to parts of the southern California coastline.
It is possible with a total of over one cm of rain, which can lead to clay flows and tailways.
It would be the first rain in the area during the rainy season.
Some skin-grade tropical rains will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October can mean intensive temperature changes throughout the United States, when the Arctic cools down but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes at short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States on Sunday.
There is almost ten degree difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to get a warm start on October with around 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be around five degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a great chance of warmer temperatures than the US average in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people looked at Brett Kavanaugh’s interrogation
Over 20 million looked at Thursday’s arresting testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s, on six television networks.
In the meantime, the political deadlock continued and the normal broadcast was interrupted for Friday's last minute-twist - Arizona Senator Jeff Flake's deal with the FBI, where they were given a week to investigate the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is absolutely sure Kavanaugh was talking to her when he was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said that he is absolutely sure that did not happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers on Friday was higher than the 20.4 million indicated by Nielsen.
The average number of viewers counted on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available to other TV networks showing the interrogation, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has problems counting people looking from office.
In comparison, there are as many viewers as for a football match in the final game or Oscarsgalan.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, had most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long interrogation, according to Nielsen.
The ABC had the second most of 3,26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.44 million, MSNBC had 2.99 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still high after the hearing.
Flake was in focus during Friday's drama.
After the Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS filmed protesters screaming at him when he tried to take an elevator to an interrogation with the Judicial Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the protesters screamed at him, as showed in the live broadcast of CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” a woman said.
Do you think he tells the truth to the country?
They also said, “You have power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors were closed, he said he would have more to say after the hearing with the committee.
The TV networks sent live several hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted if they would pass on Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the entire Senate.
But Flake said he was only going to do it if the FBI were to investigate the allegations against the nominee over the next week, which minority Democrats have declared.
Flake was partly convinced by his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision had a major impact, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of “political games” around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for “political Games” about the future of Britain and to undermine the nation’s interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other's customs duties was \"completely unreasonable.\"
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspected Dyteon Simpson for the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect of the killing of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and detained for murder, said Baton Rouge police.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
Police found the glasses on the site and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After questioning with Simpson, the police said he confessed that he killed Wayde.
His castle was set at $350,000, according to Advocate.
The coroner in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a shot wound in the head and into the neck.
Police are grateful to Louisiana State Police's refugee intelligence, police state court, Southern University police, and residents of the area for assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU’s athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their “violent” and the quest for justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98-metre-long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
On Friday, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was \"successed\" and \"shocked - by Wayde's death.
“You’re worried about this all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano Ask over Mexico City
The ash from the volcano Popocatépetl has reached the southern part of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned on Saturday Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity had been discovered in the crater and the registered 183 emissions of gas and ash over the course of 24 hours.
The center discovered several mullers and quakes.
Social media images showed thin layers of ash on windows in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have noted increased activity in the volcano, which stands 72 km southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police join Catalan separatists for the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters hit together with Kracallpolis while thousands of people participated in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists held back by the kracallpolis threw eggs and color powder on them, leading to dark ponds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Fights broke out later in the day, and policemen used their batons to stop them.
For several hours, the independence groups “never forget, never forgive — while the Unionists cried out —long live Spain —
14 people were treated for minor injuries caused by the protests, according to local pressure.
The vote is still tense in the region longing for independence one year after the referendum on the first October which was considered illegal by Madrid but was praised by Catalan separatists.
An overwhelming majority voted for independence, but participation was low when most opposed to the session boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1 000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to stop the vote at electoral stations in the region.
Independence groups camped at night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but had to take another route.
The electrician Narcis Termes, 68, participated in the protest of the separatists with his wife and said that he no longer believes that Catalonia will become independent.
Last year, we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy in being able to vote, but now we’ve been driving fast,” he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal gain in regional elections in December, Catalan parties who are for independence have had difficulty keeping the driving force up this year, as many of their most well-known leaders live in self-imposed exile or are in custody pending the trial of their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police on his mobile phone, said that the conflict had been fired on by politicians on both sides.
\"It's getting more excited,\" he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in custody since the end of last year, announced that he is planning to run in the European Parliament election next year.
“Casing to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the underwhelming we have experienced from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving into house
Three men - 33, 34 and 39 - have been arrested after a car was driven into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.

Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
An arm brush may also have been fired against the car.
Menga gives Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Mengas first goal for Livingston secured the win
Livingston shocked Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss of 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Mengas strike proved to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was shared two with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side has still not received a winning in Premiership this season and meets Hearts, with eight more points, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston extends his winning distance to six matches - head coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston loses chances against cross visitors
Holt’s team should have taken the lead long before they scored goals; their fairness caused the Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his performance across the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could just shoot wide after gliding in to measure Craig Halket's neck across the goal.
The home team was pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them when they knew they could attack in certain games.
And that’s how the decisive goal was made.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga a chance, which scored goals from the middle of the target area.
In that situation, Rangers had dominated the ball, but the home team's defense was impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely left alone.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Ranger's goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot wide from another of Livingston's definite games.
Crossings were constantly entered into Livingston's target area and were handled without problems. Two penalty requirements — after Halkett's challenge by the exchanger Glenn Middleton and one by hand — were dismissed.
- Phenomenal - from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal display and results for Livingston.
Every one was outstanding and continues to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their playing style and staff have hardly changed since they returned to the upper level, but Holt deserves the credit for galvanizing the team since their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a skilled organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worral at full span.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
They have had their moments under Gerrard, but they did not live up to the standard.
Their last ball did not hold the measure - they only opened the home page once - and it is one of the wake-up watches for the Rangers, located in the middle.
Erdogan receives a mixed welcome in Cologne
Saturday offered the smile and blue sky (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany had breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - to repair the relationship between NATO allies.
They have become unsamble about human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside Turkey.
Police claimed that they prevented 25,000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many followers gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters — many of them Kurdish — also made their voices heard and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to Germany.
The duel protests show the split views of a visitor who is considered a hero of some German Turks and condemned as a one-man ruler of others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in crash by car
A cyclist died in a crash with a car in London.
The crash took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-routed road in Deptford, southeastern London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and the nurses were called there, but the man died at the scene.
The crash takes place a few months after another cyclist died in an infection accident on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the crash on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said they are trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Roads have been blocked off and buses have been rerouted and drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in tumult
Six prison guards have been injured in concerns at a high-security prison for men, according to Prison Office.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 pm BST on Sunday and are still going on.
Specialized Tornado guards have been called there to deal with the unrest, involving eight prisoners on a wing.
The guards were treated in place for minor injuries to the face.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been sent there to handle the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those who are behind this will be related to the police and may have extended prison sentences.
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison's director was treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the riot police were called to the prison to deal with serious unrest in which staff were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (areas with drought can benefit)
It is rare that tropical low pressure reaches Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa’s remaining energy progresses over the desert in the Southwestern United States, with the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, bringing rain late Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only-ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of Arizona's border.
National Hurricane Center's latest models predict 5-10 cm of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwestern United States, including central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to have 2.5 to 5 cm of rain at risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without risk of sudden flooding, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Floods are very severe, but some of the rain will probably be useful because the Southwest United States suffers from drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reported weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first travel across the peninsula of Baja California, Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane strength in Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 135 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and travels north to 20 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler water in the Pacific Ocean, which calms it down.
It is therefore now expected to be a tropical storm in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico can get heavy rain, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
A total of 7.5 to 15 cm of rain is expected from Baja California to the north-west Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm - reported weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm and reach Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
“The greatest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora and the desert of the southwestern United States,” said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and mud flows in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsome Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three boys in the teens and a 20-year-old man have been arrested suspected of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsome Norton, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital and the situation is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the area of Radstock, the police in Avon and Somerset said.
Police are asking anyone who could have shot what happened to the phone to come out.
Trump says that Kavanaugh -led, evil, anger - from the Democratic Party
“A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump told his supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had been “suffered by the anger, anger, from the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her several decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified before the Congress of his charge.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people saw the brilliant and the quality and the bravery” of Kavanaugh that day.
“A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most skillful legal minds of our times, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public,” he said to his followers in the audience in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming middle-term exercises.
“We are five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I can't do it, but I candid it, he said.
“That’s why I’m going around fighting for great candidates.
Trump claimed that Democrats are trying to “opt and prevent”
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia, number of rises
At least 384 people died, many were swept away when giant waves crashed against the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six meters high waves crashed towards the beach in the sky and swept out many to a safe death and destroyed everything in their path.
Tsunamine came after a 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami warning came yesterday, people stayed on the beach instead of immediately running away, and they fell victim to tsunami,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster agency GDPB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
“Tsunamine was not alone, but carried cars, logs, and houses. It hit everything in its way,” Nugroho said. He also said that tsunami had travelled on the open sea for up to 800 km/h before the affected coastline.
Some climbed into trees to escape tsunami and survive, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Flight photos released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and have collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
After-hours still hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The line of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology BPPT said in a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake on Friday was 200 times as large as the nuclear bomb released on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made tsunami larger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the destruction as “wide” and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found during the fire of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and injuries can be even worse along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communication from Dongula was completely paralyzed without any information, Nugroho said.
“There are over 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” they said.
The office was criticized on Saturday for not informing that tsunami had struck Palu, but the authorities said the waves had appeared within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building shouts frenetic warnings about tsunamis to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water crashes towards the beach and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive power outage that interrupted all communication around Palu, which made the rescue work more difficult for the authorities.
The military has started sending there cargo flights using Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated people are still in great need of food and other supplies.
The city's airport has been opened for aid work and remains closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Employees from the World Vision in Dongala have made their way to Palu where they seek protection during tarps at the farm outside the office, but they saw destruction along the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
“They said they saw a lot of ruined houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Aid groups have started the supporting aid work, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and employees from abroad may only be used if emergency permits are issued after a disaster.
This has not yet happened.
“It’s still a regional disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When authorities say it’s a national disaster, we can release international assistance, but that status has not yet been announced.
When the second evening fell in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of missing people were still hoping that their loved ones would prove to be the miracles that illuminate the deadly natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who was stuck during sudden for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, Indonesia's national screen flight team coach, had trained two of the missing screen pilots for the Asian games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were stuck at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandavi, were his students.
“As a screen flying veteran, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon told us that the hours after the screen pilots heard that Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages only got a grey bowl, instead of two blue ones.
“I think it means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during bankot replenishment at Newport on the Levee
Last Friday, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's co-workers who filled in a ATM at the Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The driver of the car had emptied a ATM in the entertainment facility and would deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the message.
While he was busy, another man sprung up behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspicious escapes from the site, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the perpetrators should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed its name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed its name to Ye.
He announced the name change on Twitter on Saturday and said: “The creature who is formally known as Kanye West...
West, 41, has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande in the program, which set out for “sensical reasons,” according to the creators of the program.
Ye is a shortening of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious significance for him.
“I think that ‘yes’ is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” said West earlier this year when he was talking about the title of his album with the Big Boy radio.
- So I'm you, I'm us, we are.
It went from Kanye, which means \"the only one,\" to only Ye - a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a reflection of who we are.
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously collaborated with West, has previously written his name with and without a hyphens and verses.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's recently elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the military against civilian people now that the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody retribution against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday to “never use the military to suppress the Mexican people.”
Troops fired weapons against a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 600 people during a era when left-wing student movements broke up in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans with monthly contributions to students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and inadequate educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
US should double AI funding
Now that China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in the field, according to the inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment comes after several parts of the U.S. government have made statements about AI, although the United States does not have a comprehensive formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of becoming a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
A double such budget can double the chance that the next major AI breakthrough is made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book \"AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order\" was published earlier this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies - Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that defeated the highest-ranking American Othello player, and later he was in charge of Microsoft Research and was CEO of Google’s China department.
Lee mentioned previous technology competitions by the U.S. government, such as the Robot Challenge from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what would next be to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes the academic leaders from us, but companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed leading personalities from universities to work on AI.
Lee said that new immigration policies can also help the United States with the AI innovation.
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctoral students in AI,” he said.
The State Council of China issued its development plan for the next generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation grants grants grants to people at academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations handing out money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from the industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
U.S. legislation that would create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not made any progress in several months.
Macedonian referendum on name change
Macedonia's population voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to \"Republic of North Macedonia - which would solve a number of decades of old dispute with Greece that has prevented the country's attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its neighbour in the north constitutes a requirement on its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change would undermine the identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has led to doubts if the minimum participation of 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid will be reached.
The question of the election note in the referendum is: “Are you for membership of NATO and the EU with the approval of the agreement with Greece,
However, the members of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth changing names if it makes it possible for Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia split, to join the EU and NATO.
“I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough members of Parliament have said that they intend to follow the result in order for it to be considered decisive.
The name change requires a majority of two-thirds of Parliament.
According to the State Election Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 13 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I vote for my children, we belong in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in the Macedonia referendum on the country's name change, which would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Outside Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a small scene and place out chairs in front of the tents that have been set up by those who boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go with our heads in the air, not sneaking through the back door,” Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asian integration.
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership in NATO would lead to much needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I think that the absolute majority will vote yes, because over 80% of our inhabitants are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said that a “Yes” result would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies, between 30 and 43 percent of voters voted in the referendum, which falls below the minimum participation required.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of participants voted on Sunday.
70% of them were going to vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be counted, 50% of registered voters plus one vote must be required.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious backlash of the Western-focused government policy since it took over in May last year.
Look at: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero takes its course throughout Brighton’s defense to make goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's win of 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass from the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and walked into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around a defender and ran from several others at the edge of Brighton's target area.
He then pushed a pass to Sterling to the left.
The English forward used its first kick in the target area to give back the ball to Aguero, who used the right foot to beat Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” City’s manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he made a goal at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial takeover in the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's nest on that game.
He sent a nice kick along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the far pole.
Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the online moment before it ended up out of reach.
City meets Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from the final game, so there was no reason to force one to the start.
However, competitive Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies, located a match ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still has a chance to finish the game.
Rockies won a wild card place with a win of 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but is still looking for his first division title.
“We play about nothing, but we can get a chance to rub rubber in the knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the other team would play at a higher level than any other team I would meet this year.
Why would I not want to be there?
Nationals have not announced their start for Sunday yet, but according to reports, they tend to let Scherzer throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, heated the blast on Thursday and would throw on his normal resting day.
Washington's right-handed pitchers are 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds a speech in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court, when he talked about how important it is for Republicans to vote in the upcoming Middle Age Elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ... I don't know, but I candidate. That's why I'm going around fighting for sovereign candidates, he said.
Trump continued: “You see a terrible, terrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening here and now.
They are determined to take power back whatever it takes, you see their wickedness, terribleness.
They don’t care who they have to hurt, who they have to drive over to take over power and control. That’s what they want, power and control. We’re not going to let them get it.
\"Democrats,\" he said, fighting to “opt and prevent.”
“You’ve seen it in the last four days, he said, and called the Democrats, angry and nasty and false.
He mentioned the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was met by high-level residents from the spectators.
Remember what she said?
“Did you smell the document?”
\"Oh, uh, huh, huh?
No, no, no, I'm waiting for a...'It was really bad body language, one of the worst body language I've ever seen,
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They don’t tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a series of Labor MPs that are told that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament Joan Ryan was treated in a similar way when she was facing anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on the security of the nation, on Europe - ironically, similar to Jeremy’s previous leaders.
The Communication on the Meeting with Nottingham East Labour on Friday stated that “we want the meetings to be welcoming and productive.”
For most of my eight years as Labour’s local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been exactly that.
But now, unfortunately, many meetings aren’t, and the promise of “friendly, gentler” policy has been forgotten a long time ago, if it ever started.
It has become increasingly apparent that dissenting views are not tolerated within Labour, and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether the party’s leaders accept it.
This began soon after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues whom I previously believed had a similar political view that I expected me to make a full conversion and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed to — whether it was about national security or the EU’s internal market.
Every time I speak publicly - and it doesn’t really matter what I say - follows a dozen of wets on social media that require me to be deposed, criticizes my policies and says I shouldn’t even be in Labour.
And this doesn't just affect me.
In fact, I am more lucky than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the professionality and determination of these colleagues when they face a stream of sexist and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era’s policy is the level of insults now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality, we are no longer this broad church and with every distrust and change in the selection rules, the party becomes increasingly narrow.
I have received many advice in the last two years about flying under the radar and not being too straight forward, so it is ordering itself.
But that’s not why I became a politician.
Ever since I joined Labour as a school student 32 years ago, provoked by Thatcher's government neglect that literally caused my primary school classroom to collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it the most - both at local level and as government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, and that includes the last election.
No one in Nottingham East may in any way have been confused by my views on policies and topics where I do not agree with the current leadership.
To you who promoted the claim on Friday, I just want to say that when the country goes against a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services, I don’t understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour Party leaders.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency - both Labour members and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of deposing me or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I think is best for you all.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Oslagna Ayr on top
Two attempts in the last minute may have distorted the result a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They are now at the top, the only unbeatable side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, which gave the home team the profit, and coach Peter Murchie has all the right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested during our games so far and are still unbeatable, so we’re very happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than we do.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card for Scotland's captain Rory Hughes, who was released by Warriors for the match, Melrose let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot make an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's leadership with a penalty, and at the end of the first half he scored points and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead of 17-5 in the break.
But Melrose got a good start on the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
It was then a long wait for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the plan, and after the restart, Ayr increased the management again with an attempt by Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting Captain Blair MacPherson then received a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of extreme pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the penalty line out behind Ayrs maul.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent off the flank Gregor Henry for his fifth attempt.
Still Game star seems ready for new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems ready to enter the restaurant industry after it was discovered that he has been appointed CEO of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays together with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemhill.
Duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to plan for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Akkogmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source on Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan would enter Glasgow-flower restaurant industry -
“The sea belongs to us: Kustlaus Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific Sea again.
Seamen patrol a rigged headquarters for the fleet of La Paz.
Public buildings have a sea blue flag.
The fleet’s bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon carry motto: “Havet belongs to us.
It is our duty to recover it.
In coastal Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still strong - and there is also the longing to sail again on the Pacific Ocean.
This hope is higher than in several decades now when Bolivia is awaiting a decision from the International Court of Justice on the first October, after five years of consideration.
“Bolivia has the operation, a sense of unity and peace, and clearly awaits the result of a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the international court’s decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the Court of the Hague will judge in favor of Bolivia’s demands that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, must negotiate with Bolivia to allow them a separate outlet to the sea.
Monday’s decision also has great importance for Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president who is facing a controversial re-election campaign next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Sea, he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is incredible that the Court is judging to Bolivia’s advantage, and that not much would be changed even if it does.
The United Nations court, based in the Netherlands, has no right to assign Chilean territory and has suggested that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision is announced only six months after the final arguments suggests that the case —not was complicated — said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And over the last four years, it may have been more likely to hurt than to promote Bolivia’s chances.
“The question of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
She claims that Morale’s aggressive rhetoric has tarnished on Chile’s remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Prior to this President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, did not consider that the court's decision had been taken exceptionally quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia - an outstanding opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile - and a chance to - put an end to 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the issue of the sea as a political crucifix.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The decision is a chance to realize that we have to move forward from the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament requires confidence in the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that the nation will not defeat its nuclear weapons first if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the two rival leaders.
His comments came when U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of solving the death toll for nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a “want dream” to continue sanctions and US protests against a statement that ending the Korean War will ever silence North Korea.
Washington hesitates to agree to the statement without the fact that Pyongyang first initiates significant nuclear disarmament.
Kim and President Donald Trump both want a summit.
But there is widespread skepticism against Pyongyang really going to get rid of an arsenal that the country probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion views reveal the latest line huge main settlements on the way to shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a range of noisy, oversized main estates for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which glided the stylists at Paris fashion week.
Incredibly impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designers have sent off their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino's greatest creation was an excessive beige hat with a spring-like wide hatbreath that completely took over the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a wizard hat, and even an pineapple - but they are not intended to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre worms, in due time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had assembled lips and rather resembled Hannibal Lecter than Haute Couture.
A creation resembled a wet suit with snorkel and dive mask, and another looked like a melted glass shirt.
And if you continue the enormous courage, you are lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the huge horses can be on their way to shops near you.
The oversized hats come soon after La Bomba - the straw hat with a 60 cm brate that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratakowski.
The cult brand that was behind the incredibly impractical hat that has taken over social media sent out yet another great creation on the catwalk - a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the model in the swimsuit that held it.
The terracotta Raffia bag, with electric fibers and a white leather handle, excelled in Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris fashion week.
Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the stores next summer — the designer has had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories —
John Edward: Language skills essential to global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools maintain outstanding academic results and this continued 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, which are only strengthened by individual and collective advances in sports, arts, music and other social engagements.
With up to 30,000 students in Scotland, schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement customized curriculums, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and requested topics at schools.
Nelson Mandela said, \"If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.
It’s a powerful reminder that we can’t just rely on English when we create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s test results show that language is at the top of the list, with a maximum number of approved results within independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received A in the final exam Higher Grade.
Data collected from SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 per cent of students who studied Mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as a subject choice is now considered to be as important as natural knowledge, technology, engineering and mathematics on curriculums in independent schools and beyond.
A study conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 concluded that employers had difficulty filling their vacancies, with 17 percent attributed to a lack of language skills.
With this said, language skills become all the more necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs that require language skills, these skills become necessary in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career choice, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries, automatically provides a multilingual person with a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adult Brits published by YouGov 2013, 75% said that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that came up in total in a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
Therefore, it is so important to invest in language teaching for our children.
Being able to speak multiple languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance of finding meaningful employment in the future.
In Scotland, each school will teach different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important to the UK for 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and have them with the skills necessary to succeed, regardless of what the future has in place.
In a global economic environment, it is undoubtedly a language that continues to be crucial for the country's future, so it needs to reflect in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as “international communication skills”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland’s young people.
Il faut been le faire.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James make debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday’s first season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he plays has not yet been decided.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on Laker’s official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers’ preseason schedule.
“I don’t need preseason games at this stage of my career to get ready,” he said.
Trumps West Virginia campaign events, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is making his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first of five planned performances next week, including events in places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In anticipation of a confirmatory vote by his candidate to the Supreme Court's vacant post, Trump aims to build support for upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress before the upcoming November election.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trumps Wheeling, West Virginia campaign events are scheduled for 19:00, tonight Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trumps West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely address this week's interrogation of the candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense after accusations of his sexual abuse, with an expected delay in voting from the Senate for up to a week while FBI investigation of the case is ongoing.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help the Republicans get some meat on their legs before the November election.
Thus President Trump said that these five meetings next week aim to “engage volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives” according to Reuters.
“The control of Congress is so important for his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the hectic campaign period,” said a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to be named Reuters.
The night's events, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh's media - according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is the second time Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has been following in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come there to try to give him an increase in opinion polls,” says Simon Haeder, a state scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA fights to keep hope alive before Sunday's singles
After three unilateral sessions, the couple competitions in Saturday afternoon could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The moment's swinging pendulum is a fully invented sports concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before, in front of competitions like these.
So what moment is it about now?
“They had a six-point line and now there are four, so we wear it as a small moment I guess,” said Jordan Spieth when he finished for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points’ advance with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have some wind in the sail, but they have a lot to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and combed home three points out of four each.
Spieth has been watered from tea to green and precedes with a good example.
The wine trope peeled even higher as his round continued and he lowered a decisive putt to take the match four all-square when he and Thomas had been behind by two after two games.
His putt who won them the match of 15 met with a similar noise, with the belief that the American team is not yet out of the game.
“You really need to dig deep and worry about your own match,” Spieth said.
That's all that all these players have left now.
18 holes for victory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's unquestionable story.
Europe’s odd but adorable couple are four from four and now nothing can go wrong.
“Moliwood was the only couple that didn’t make a bow on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided arceys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back ninja on Friday morning.
These performances and audience responses state that they are the players to hit on Sunday and there are no more popular players who could come home a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Prefer both, at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, along with Alex Noren.
One arcey and two doubles on front nine, the Spaniard and the Swede sank into a hole that they never even came near to crawling out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are so fascinating to look at close places because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give and how a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a law so far and taken a significant lead before the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has a struggle of pleasure that some, especially on the side of the United States, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in the Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage on Ryder Cup's last day after coming out from Saturday's foursomes and foursomes matched with a 10-6 lead across the United States.
The inspired duon Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two wins over a besieged Tiger Woods and combed home all four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who struggled to keep the cup that they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that never really got started in the morning's four ball with 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the Foursome and won two matches, but that was not enough for victory.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points from Sunday’s 12 single matches to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, named \"Molliwood\" after a sensational weekend is just the second pair to win four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in four-ball, they beat a exhausted Woods and American rookie Bryson Decambaau with an even more reticent 5 & 4.
Woods, who went through two games on Saturday, showed a sample of moments of brilliants, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-ball and foursome, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning's four ball and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 & 1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe did not have any co-winds all the way, but it was a nice, windy day just southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the landmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They combed home victory with 2 & 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four ball and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history, one team has come back from a four-point subjugation in the single matches, however, Furyk's side only needs an undecided result to keep the cup.
After being the second best for two days, it looks like a counterattack on Sunday can be difficult to get through.
North Korea says they will never “weaponate one-sidedly without confidence.”
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday to continue sanctions deepened their distrust towards the United States and it was not possible that the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant measures to show its goodwill — for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantle installations for nuclear tests, and promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We don’t see a similar answer from the United States,” he said.
“With no confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to an approach divided into stages for the nuclear power that would lead to North Korea being rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant, as it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution completely like Pyongyang previously made.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit of a sitting U.S. President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work towards the \"destruction of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula - while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abolish its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also declined negotiations to ease heavy international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘deliberation first — and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose through coercion and even object to the declaration of ending the war,” Ri says.
“The notion that sanctions can get us on our knees is a wish dream for those who lack knowledge of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that U.S. leaders highlighted in the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korea’s leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the party to this issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea and not the United States, the Korean Peninsula’s nuclear disarmament would not have come to such a death place,
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's future ability to reach the United States mainland with rockets was inevitable after \"Mr Evil President-Trump called Kim en-raketman\" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take measures for disarmament, but said that much work still remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit for this and said that if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the actions taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: “The maintenance of the Security Council’s sanctions must continue with force and without failing until we realise a complete, final, verified disarmament...
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to suffocate funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri in the context of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made. North Korea, however, accused him a few hours later of setting-gang-like demands.
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear crisis complex if the United States took similar measures,
He said that Kim had told him that the “consistent measures” he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and moves towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has led all doctoral students to improve their sleep habits in an effort to combat the growing macho culture to study through caffeine-filled “dysts”
An academic study found that students at the world’s leading universities are often ignorant when it comes to the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first in his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
“At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why don’t I know this until now, during my last year?’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was organised for the first time this year, explains to students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of University Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from severe sleep shortages during the week.
The hour-long course includes a range of interactive tasks.
In part of the course there is a picture of a student room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleep shortages and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another part, participants learn how long-term sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that it will not change students’ behavior directly.
But we believe that they have the right to know - just as one has the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes, - added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in “deepness” still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and constant pressure on students meant that sleep lack was a growing problem.
To ensure that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student’s secret weapons — to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said — even to avoid weight gain because insomnia puts the brain in hunger and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course and has read one of his courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course was an eye opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before starting their studies at the high-performance institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to lay down and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” issued by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can cause you to turn around on the clock, leading to insom problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengas target sinks Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Mengas strike sent Steven Gerrard's uneven side to a 1-0 defeat team in Livingston.
The Ibrox side was looking to take home its first win on the road since February 4-1 triumf on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his team eight points after Ladbrokes Premiership leader Harts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-time and Rangers never managed to smooth out the result.
While Rangers now falls to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is just behind the Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be more problems on the spot for the Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was thrown from the far end.
Gerrard made eight changes in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 who scored a point by Hearts last week and he would have been pleased with the way his well-married game overwhelmed the opponents every time.
Rangers must have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
It should have been a goal already two minutes into the match when Mengas first pass released through Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his big chance and shot outside.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs then reached team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the rear pole.
Rangers took control of the match, but it seemed to be more hope than faith in their games during the final third of the match.
Alfredo Morelo probably felt that he should have had a penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's call.
Rangers only managed to score two goals in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily welcomed Lassana Coulibalysnick and a domestic kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Livis’s opening shot in the 34th minute must go against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their kneeling deserved it.
Again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacob's permanent situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher matched Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the switch gave almost immediate effect when the outside hit the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block the attempt.
However, Livingston continued to make the opponents play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett that swept up long pass after long passage.
Holt's side could have strengthened his lead at the last stage, but McGregor managed to prevent Jacobs before Lithgow nodded outside after the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton had yet another late demand for punishment when he was hit with Jacobs, but again, Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday’s Almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today...the day of the future physicist John Wilhelm-Hans-Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the manick called Geiger meters.
Geiger meters have become a foundation stone for science since then and are also great in pop culture, as well as in the 1950 film \"Bells of Coronado - starring in the seemingly unlikely Cowpoke researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What in the world is that?
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger meter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms produced by the radioactivity of the minerals.
Evans: “Yes, it’s now popping.
He died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” — cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see — cancer cells and kill them.”
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method means to extract immune cells from a patient and modify them in the laboratory
They can then - see - a protein that is common to many cancers and then re-injected
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer, saw her ovarian cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can “see — a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine...
HER2 - promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells has worked when treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA cap, after his SNL performance.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a slumping appearance praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying that he himself would be running for the 2020 post.
After performing his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, where he wore a Make America Great caps, praised the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
“So many times when I talk to a white person, they say, ‘How do you like Trump, he’s racist?
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood Star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate’s judicial committee about the allegations of sexual abuse made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the recording of West's performance was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to drive the West with the post.
West had also complained to the public that he had been harassed backstage for his main pawn.
They bullied me backstage.
They said, “Don’t go out there with that cap on.
They bullied me!
And then they say I fell low,\" he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you also want to lower low, saying that he would put my supermancape on, because that means you can’t say what I can do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Test with Love
His comments attracted more burop at least twice from the audience and employees from the SNL seemed to be creating, Variety reported. One person said: \"It became death-resistant in the studio --
West had come in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West enchanted many with his appearance of the song I Love it, dressed in a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the Conservative Group TPUSA, the Canadian Turner who tweeted: “To one of the bravest souls: TACK FOR YOU TO BEST YOUR MOBBEN...
But the host of the chat show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that the West was simply -was itself and it is absolutely wonderful -
“But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his “art,” which I think embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We are, she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now the creature previously known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapparkollege, Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
Dom for attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been accused of attempted murder after a man stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.

The respondent is expected to arrive at the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The allegations will be reviewed by the Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington defeats toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has spoken negatively about the stereotype of the macho hero and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes that \"something has gone wrong\" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also she 31, admitted that he feels “very strong” to address the problem.
“I personally feel quite strong, right now, where have we gone wrong with masculinity,” he said.
“How have we raised men in view of the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that TV can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued, “What is innate and what is innate?”
What is taught on TV and on the streets, which makes young boys feel they have to be in a certain way to be a man?
I think it is really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.
In the interview, he also acknowledged that he would not make any Game of Thrones followers when the series comes to an end next summer and says he is “ready with battlefields and horses.”
From November, Kit will play in a remake of Sam Shepards True West which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks that the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience from the Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife thanks to the series, so it gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
Rose played Ygrite, in which Kit's character Jon Snow falls in love, in the Emmys-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, the health authorities say.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases were transmitted via sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spread through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusion.
However, the number of people infected by HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people from year to year.
HIV infection through sexual intercourse is an urgent issue in China’s HBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against HBT people is said to be widespread.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will marry women sooner or later.
Many of the infections are due to insufficient protection in the case of sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses that staff leaked the GOP senator's tasks, blames on “hazard lies,” and “conspiracy theories.”
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters condemned on Saturday allegations that one of her employees had posted personal data on three Republican U.S. Senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these claims were spread by right-wing extremist websites.
“Lakes, lies, and more objectionable lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information contained home addresses and telephone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information came up online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel's hearing about the allegations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Water's office and released the information about a member of Waters staff, Hill reported.
“This unrounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie,” the Waters continued.
\"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims - were not in any way responsible for the leak of this information.
This false claim is completely false and an absolute lie.
Water's statement quickly received criticism online, including from the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she does not have the temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they must not be angry.
They can't be brave.
They must not question the motive of the questioner.
They must be calm and sensed.
Fleischer seemed to attempt to compare Water's response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing to be angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who candidated to depos Waters in the middle of the term of office also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great about the truth, he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said her office had warned - appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent claims.
\"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed,\" she continued, \"and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees.\"
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again - powerless spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit benefits in every new film with British slope, and the same seems to apply to this remake of the latest Johnny English action comedy - a series of spy parodys kicked off in 2003 with Johnny English and regained life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the water satir of how obvious we are to become the nation’s new export product?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has received his license to blame for the sake renewed for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation intended for biopublic even in non-English-speaking countries
He is obviously the silly secret agent, who, despite his bizarre claims of smoothieglamour, has received a little bit of Clouseau, a stunt Mr Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the Olympics in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveller and the international mysterious man that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There are one or two great moments in the latest JE film
I loved when Johnny English approaches a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the rotor blades briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy appears, but the humor feels quite low-counted and strangely superfluous, especially since the \"serious - the film brands such as 007 and Mission Imposible themselves now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels as if it is adapted for children instead of adults and for me, Johnny English is strange uplifting not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film bravader in the role of Bean.
The ever-present issue is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the United Kingdom’s super secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all UK agents in the field, to the agent in the service’s great dissatisfaction - an incredibly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and hard-working figure, who already suffers from a complete collapse of his political popularity: Emma Thompson does his very best with this quiz-Teresa-May character but the script does not offer much to work with.
Her intelligence adviser informs her that when every single active spy is busy, she must use someone who retired.
And that means the stuttering Johnny English in his own high person, now employed as a teacher in any wealthy institution, but offering unofficial lessons in the art of working undercover alongside.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his previously long-lived sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, a jolly hockey stick role where Vicki Pepperdine is close to waste.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terribly wrong with Her Majesty's Secret Service and encounters Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister will fall hard for the charismatic tech billionaire, who claims that he can solve the UK’s computer break: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of farsted up trains: dressed for waiters, they set fire at a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle aboard Volta's luxury boat; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta's house.
There is certainly a lot of work behind the last sequence, but even though the film is both charming and fast-filled, it has an air of children’s TV around it.
Quite moderate as everything.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can’t help but think: Can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies that a plan for British to work a four-day week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corby's party Labour is considering a radical plan that the British are working a four-day week - but getting paid for five.
The party wishes, according to the task, that business leaders leave savings made through the revolution in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but keep the same pay.
According to sources, the idea would “pass” with the party’s economic agenda for the benefit of the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A representative higher up in Labor told The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It will not happen in a day, but a four-day working week is an effort that fits into the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, including the Greens party which promised a four-day working week during its campaign in 2017.
However, this objective is not endorsed by Labour as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not the party’s policy and there is nothing the party agrees on.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from “intentionless leaders” and “snickers” on state companies.
The shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that the current shareholders in water companies can’t get their entire stake back, because a Labour government can do “deductions” because of what they perceive has been wrong actions.
He also confirmed plans to put workers in corporate boards and create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds where 10 percent of the private company’s own capital is transferred to its employees, which are then to receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell in the TV program - 60 minutes - whether the FBI’s investigation of Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the Agency's investigations could cause some Republican Senators to change their position on the matter.
In an interview sent in Sunday, 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would lead to their change of opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
\"Of course, Kennedy said.
“I said when I went into the hearing, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that the claim came out, saying, “Have you done it?
He was determined, convinced, unmistakable.
Graham’s voice, however, seems unmistakable.
“I’ve already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynami thought,” he said.
\"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it,\" Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And all her names couldn't verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new changing.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormously impressive setting of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; to combat world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people wailing to the Central Parks Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's real goal: to fight extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, according to a 2012 statement, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international pre-language group that hopes to fight poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you weren’t ready to pay for a VIP ticket), concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or actions — such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling or in other meaningful ways would help raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just about so-called “clicktivism” - people who feel that they make real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen states that more than 19 million documents have been registered - from its followers who have fought for a variety of goals.
It is said that these measures have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies that correspond to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or funded.
The group estimates that the assets collected so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the UK between investors and players who are committed to “helping children develop to their full potential — promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help combat malnutrition in the area after receiving more than 4,700 Tweets from global citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make social injustice as malnutrition is a footnote in history,” the ambassador for the partnership Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 measures were taken that require Britain to improve the diet for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes diet programs targeting 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the common questions on its website, “What makes you think that we can fight extreme poverty”
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartence movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who perform at this year's events in New York City, whose hosts are Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use its fleet in a 'blocked' - to prevent Russian energy exports state the Minister of Home Affairs
The government may, if necessary, resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy actors from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke has revealed, cited by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria - especially where it acts on the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, Europe’s southern parts,” he said.
And according to him, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The U.S. has the ability to, with our fleet, ensure that the seaways are kept open and, if necessary, apply blocked, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants in the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group calling themselves the voice of the energy consumer in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they were really the same.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “dayly country — with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement comes after the Trump administration has aimed at increasing the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inadequate” North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the Moscow prisoner.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline of $11 billion, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
They argue that Washington’s opposition to the project is only driven for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position was repulsed by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I strongly dislike that a third party is disrupting our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will take a “Ordinary Thinker” if she is to run in the 2020 presidential election,” Massachusetts Senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a “Ordinary thinker” about her participation in the presidential election after the United States mid-term election.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider setting up as a candidate.
“It’s time for women to get to Washington and fix our broken government and it includes a woman on top,” she said.
“After 6 November, I will take a real thinker to run into the presidential post.
Warren weighed into President Donald Trump during the Town Hall meeting and said that he took this country in the wrong direction.
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been free-speaking in his criticism of Trump and his candidate to the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “We need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own supporters did not believe that she would be able to do so in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the “ faithful” Massachusetts voters said that the Senator should not be able to do so, according to a study conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The study showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont's Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after taking office in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
“What my own son is going through, what he’s going through now when he’s back, I can relate to other families who have experience with PTSD and part of the trauma that our soldiers return with,” she told the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest for the elephant in the room, and said of his son and other war veterans that they will come back as other people, they will return hardened, they will come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and flyers and all other members of the military have given the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and accused of domestic violence against a woman, attempting to prevent a report on domestic violence and arms possession in a drunk state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, as well as the District of Columbia, support the question of a new asylum policy
Arton states and the District of Columbia support a legal trial aimed at a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims who flee gang-related violence or violence in the home.
Representatives from the 18 states and districts filed a friendly-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the claimant in the case of Grace v. Sessions submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner —and his violent gang members — mistreated her, but American officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
States lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries that produce a large number of asylum seekers, such as nations facing major problems with gangs and violence in the home.
The new US asylum policy amended a 2014 decision by immigration authorities allowing illegal immigrants to seek asylum to escape domestic violence.
The District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “recognises decades of state, federal and international law —
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be assessed based on specific facts and circumstances to which the claim applies, and such a provision is contrary to that principle — according to the Friend-of-the-court report.
Lawyers further claimed in the report that policies that deny the entry of immigrants harm the U.S. economy and argue that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “deliver the necessary labor,”
In June, Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered judges in asylum cases to no longer grant asylum to victims who fled violence in the home and gang violence.
“Asyl is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a certain social group or political opinion,” Sessions said when the policy was announced on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems - even all serious problems - that people face every day all over the world.
Desperata rescue efforts in Palu when the death rate doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation looked worse.
\"It feels very tense,\" said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted his cowardly boy in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
“Ambulances catch dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is a commodity.
The inhabitants were seen returning to their ruined homes, rooting through water damaged possessions and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were damaged in the earthquake of 7.5 were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continued severe aftershock.
With tearful eyes, he told us that the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel that he shared with his wife and daughter.
We didn't escape.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think - Haris told the Associated Press and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe.
U.S. ambassador accuses China of \"bombing\" with \"propaganda ads\"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American newspaper on the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador accused China that Beijing used the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily paying an extra in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's best selling magazine - after accusing China of attempting to participate in the US's 6th Congressional Election, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters where is a new phase in an escalating campaign from Washington intended to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war with elevated tariffs on each other’s imports.
China's retaliation tariffs early in the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states such as Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a debate article on Sunday's Des Moines Register, \"now doubles the bullying by posting propaganda ads in our own free press,
“China’s government uses America’s dear tradition of freedom of speech and free press to spread propaganda to by publishing paid advertising ads in Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in the newspaper church on the street here in Beijing, you will find a limited number of dissenting votes and will not see any true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have about China’s troubled economy, because the media is controlled by the iron hand of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers nominated the offer to publish — his article, even if he didn’t say which magazine.
Republicans scare away female voters before the mid-term election through Kavanaugh fiasco, warn analysts
Because many top republicans defend the Supreme Court's nominee Brett Kavanaugh facing several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a setback, especially from women, during the upcoming election.
The feelings around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the election.
“It is not possible to turn the clock back,” said Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubts Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s last attempt to an FBI investigation will suffice to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November,” says Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to Washington, DC.
On Friday morning, the protestors-November will, when they protested in the hall to the Senate building, when the Republicans who control the Court Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, said Mic.
“Democracy enthusiasm and motivation will go into the roof,” said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, for the news site.
“People say it’s already been high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among still undetermined female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, despite not liking the president, often do not vote --
Already before Ford's public testimony with allegations of sexual abuse against the nominee candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a setback could follow if the Republicans pushed through the confirmation.
“This has become a confused touch for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the Committee’s vote or the final vote or if Kavanaugh comes through, it’s also about how Republicans have handled this and how they’ve treated her,” said Guy Cecil, head of the Priorities of the United States, a group that helps democratic election campaigns, for the news channel.
But the Americans generally seem to be divided over who to believe in in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, and the latter seems to be the one they believe in the most.
A new opinion poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, as well as those from at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate court committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh violently attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court exposed her genitals while attending a party during their time as a student at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people get access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is “World domination”.
“We have to do it now,” he said about the start-up company.
“It’s a historic moment.
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own —personal online data large — or a POD.
It can include contact lists, to make lists, calendar, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser at the same time.
What is unique with the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access which type of information.
The company calls it “personal authorisation through data”
The idea with Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some programme developers to work with the project and a group of volunteer codes.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to \"Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are placed at the top of a night.
We do not ask for permission.
In a post on Media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee Internet was converted when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality in recent months.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about this new era on the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Priest awarded with Viktoria Cross during World War I is celebrated
The only priest in the English Church who was rewarded with a Victoria Cross during World War I is now celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his action during the attack on Belleglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had been awarded the most prestigious prize of the British military.
A memorial was uncovered by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “brilliant symbolically — that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded with the award.
According to London Gazette, Lt Col Vann led on September 29, 1918 his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin, through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns.
He later rushed up to the line of fire and led with “great bravery” — the line forward before alone deciding the battle.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were —something that I know I could never live up to, but something I am very humble to —
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he “recognized himself very honored to play a role in the parade — adding that the real hero’s against is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people —
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and instead got to see Greta Gris
Imagine this, you've stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 just to be denied watching the main event.
The show from San Jose contained 13 matches, including sex on the main card and was shown live at night in the UK on channel 5.
At 06:00, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the program suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were impressed after they had stayed awake to the early morning hours to watch the match.
A fan on Twitter described the change in the program to a cartoon children's program as \"a sick joke,\"
“It was the government’s decision that the content was not appropriate so early in the morning, so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president for marketing and communication when asked about the broadcast.
“Greta Pig, Yes”
Bellator’s CEO Scott Coker said they will work on their planning to better include British viewers in the future.
“I think we’ll be able to find a solution with regard to the re-price,” Coker said.
“But there are six in the morning on a Sunday there and we will not be able to solve this to Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the program switch upset many.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was actually a government issue.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We will show five games instead of sex - as we normally do. We took water over our heads in our quest to satisfy the fans.
This is an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “underpass” because of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he felt inferior to his comrades during his upbringing due to his sexuality - but it also spurred him to success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize he wasn't like everyone else until he was in high school.
When speaking in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give others “hope”.
He also said that he cared less about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The popular show’s regular programme manager, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
During his one-time performance on the first program of Laverna, Daley tells how he felt — less worth it — than others during his childhood, because “it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls.”
He said: “This feeling of feeling less worthy and feeling different has been a real source of power and strength to succeed.
He wanted to prove that he was someone, he said, so that he didn't betray everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile advocate for HBT rights and utilized his appearance at the Commonwealth Games of the year in Australia to convince more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke out because he felt he was lucky to be able to live openly without limitations and wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said that his love for a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - came as a surprise.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age — he participated in his first OS at age 14, and his father died of cancer three years later — he said it was hard to find someone at the same age with similar life experiences.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his “full life perspective” had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was only about winning gold,” he said.
But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie.
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that Dad did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about was if they got their tickets to the 2012 London Olympic Games - where he wanted to sit on the first row.
“I couldn’t say to him: you won’t be able to sit on the front row of Dad,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally admitted he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life — to dive in front of a home audience in an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Proud of Heather Small - a song that had followed him until the Olympics and which still gave him wrinkles.

Mickelson watch form on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will hit record on Sunday when playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he must fix the shape to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's Foursomes and Foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of events, which he has often been for the United States, the five-fold winner spent his day between acting cheerleaders and training on his game in the hope of having a chance to show off his ability.
He has never been the straightest of drivers, not even on top of his career and the 48-year-old is not in shape in front of the tough track at Le Golf National, where the long puff often penalizes hard.
It is not only the track that deters, in the ninth match on Sunday, Mickelson meets champion Francesco Molinari, who, together with the novi Tommy Fleetwood, won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are 4 points ahead of the 12 single matches have a win at first, Mickelson’s match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say much else.
“He completely understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on his back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“His confidence is nothing wrong with.
He is a celebrity and he has contributed so much to these teams in previous seasons and during the past week.
I probably didn't think he would be able to play two games.
I thought he could do more, but now it's what it is and we'll have to enjoy it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.
On Sunday, Mickelson passes Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never fully lived up to the heights of his individual results.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven halves, but Furyk said his presence brought other qualities to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he likes to joke with people and he’s a good guy to have on the team,” he explained.
“I also think the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He brings so much more than just games.
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership may soon be a memory only
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can quickly change into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team under Seve Ballestero's leadership held a five-point advantage over the Americans but ultimately won with the lowest possible margin with the 141⁄2-131⁄2 result.
“You are reminded that we were leading big on Valderrama, we were leading big on Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with need and care,” said Bjorn (in the photo) after seeing 2018’s class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and lead with 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will prove to me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we'll give it all.
Go out and do everything right.
This is not over until we see the point on the board.
Our goal is to try to win this trophy and that is where our focus lies.
I have said it all the time, I focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we are well aware of what is waiting on the other side - the best players in the world -
Björn was pleased with the performances of his players on a tough golf course and added: “I would never cope with this myself.
Tomorrow will face new challenges.
Tomorrow it is the individual performances that apply and that is a completely different thing.
It’s fun to be out with a partner when it goes well, but when you’re out there on your own, your capacity as a golf player is tested fully.
It is the message you need to convey to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he also has to go and get the best out of himself.
Unlike Björn, opponent Jim Furykk wants players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who combed home three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of major conversions during the last days of a race, both in the winning team of Brookline before he finished losing as a loser when Europe drove the \"Miracle at Medinah\"
\"I remember every fucking word of it -- he said in response when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, had gathered his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to go out as fast as on Brookline, as on Medinah.
When the pace starts in one way, there will be a lot of pressure on these medium matches.
We made our show and placed the guys we wanted to, you know, create some magic tomorrow...
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the fight and meeting Rory McIlroy in the top match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
“I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it’s enough all the way,” Bjorn said about his singles.
Germany's new warship is delayed again
The German fleet's newest frigate would have been launched in 2014 to replace warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will not be launched until at least next year due to incorrect systems and high costs, local media reported.
The launch of the “Rheinland-Pfalz” leadership for the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg fregates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesperson.
The ship should have joined the fleet as early as 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery were devastating for the ambitious project.
The four boats in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen fregates.
They will contain a powerful gun, a series of anti-aircraft and maritime missiles, as well as some sneak technicians, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the latest frigates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships - which allow Germany to project power abroad - are already obsolete when they are put into operation, writes Die Zeit.
The fateful F125 fraternity created headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the return, but German media stated a number of important “software and hardware errors” that made the warship worthless if used on a combat mission.
The lack of the software was particularly important because boats in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a staff of about 120 sailors - just half of the crew of older frigates in the Bremen class.
It also emerged that the ship has a significant obesity, leading to impaired performance and limiting the marines' ability to perform future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from incorrect hardware, the entire project’s price tag - including training the crew - also becomes a problem.
It has been said to have gone to fraud EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - compared to EUR 2.2 billion in the starting stage.
Problems affecting the latest frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany’s maritime power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's Defense Committee, acknowledged that the fleet was in fact to have a lack of fully equipped ships.
The official said it was a growing problem, as old ships were discontinued but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust theft to the secret life of the bat
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help control future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the South and Dwarf Pilistrell as well as brown loaned and Daubenton flatter mice at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important places around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat sound and what species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area view of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature care advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the flat-screen mouse and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forestlands for flat-dermal mice and other related species.
Fladdermus populations in Scotland and in the United Kingdom have decreased significantly in the past century.
They are threatened by building and development work that affects the well and loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as aircraft and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks from domestic taxes.
Fladder mice are actually not blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to capturing prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes flatter mice very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct investigations, examine the bon and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organization has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve on the Three Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson says the property is the ideal area for them.
“Here at Three, we have a good area for bats,” he said.
“We have the old buildings, lots of winter trees and a variety of favorable habitats.
But there is a lot about flat mice that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us understand more about what they need to thrive.
He emphasises the importance of searching for flats before performing maintenance in real estate, as it is possible that accidental destruction of a single nest could kill up to 400 females and young people, and possibly wipe out an entire population.
Fladder mice are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, trouble or disturb them or destroy their bon.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species, we don’t know how their populations are,
Ronaldo rejects rape conviction while his lawyers threaten to sue the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape charges against him for ‘false news’ and says people want to market themselves by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375.000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a Live video on Instagram, Ronaldo (33) turned off the reports as “false news” when speaking to his 142 million followers, just hours after the claim was reported.
No, no, no.
What they said today was fake news, the five-fold Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it is part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything good - said the player and smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers prepare to sue Der Spiegel over claims, which they have called - an unauthorised reporting of suspicions of integrity - according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for “moral damage to an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years,”
The alleged event is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was -99 percent - a \"good guy - betrayed by the \"last percent\"
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was with consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed to a settlement because she felt “scred of retaliation — and was worried about being “damaged publicly”
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to cancel the settlement because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of €100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom - will forever regret - to lose car manufacturers
The UK would regret it forever - if you lost your status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was “ororeal” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, they will temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event of no agreement being concluded could result in lost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stops in our factory,” says Marvin Cooke, President of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have communicated their concern about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini facility in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems apply to car manufacturers are the risks to the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without settlement.
Toyota’s production line is operated on a ‘just-in-time’ basis, with parts coming every 37:e minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for vehicles ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it may lead to disruptions at the border as the industry says may lead to delays and deficiencies of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's consumption in stock at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and hence production would be forced to stop.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequer's plan for future relations with the EU is -exactly calibrated to avoid border controls -
“We need a settlement. We want the best deal that enables, as I say, not only success at the moment to be appreciated, but for us to take this opportunity,” he said to BBC Radio 4:’s program Today.
“The statements from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that increasing costs would reduce the competitiveness of the facility and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the leader of the Unite department at the factory, said that his members are increasingly worried: “My experience is that these jobs never come back.
A government official said: “We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump’s meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could “be shot in another week — while the fight against the Supreme Court nominees Brett Kavanaugh continues,” White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of specialist advisor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian involvement in the election, relations between Trump and Russia, and the President's potential obstacle to justice.
Whether Trump will kick the Deputy Attorney General, and thus endanger Mueller’s independence, has been fueling Washington’s fights for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing cancellation equipment to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president via the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, and reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said that he would \"predict--not kick Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's legal committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual inaccuracies, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “One date for it has not been established, it can happen this week, or a delay with one week in view of all other things happening at the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date.
Some reporters would dispute that claim: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to any disillusionment towards TV reporters who —play for the gallery — even though she said: “I agree with the fact that they are playing for the gallery,
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
“The president holds more questions than any president before him,” she said, adding, without citing evidence: “We’ve looked at these figures.
Conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen us do a lot over the past few weeks and it will replace press conferences, and you can then ask questions directly to the President of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances before the collective reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU employees at NHS Scotland, taking into account concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and desire to remain behind Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to covering the cost of discontinued status applications for EU citizens working in the country's decentralized public sector.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: “In summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on exit have continued, before decisions are expected to come this autumn.
But the British government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to repeat how much I value the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health care work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after he suffered from head injury
Tennessee State Tigers lineback Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after having suffered a head injury in Saturday’s loss of 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee’s Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before half-time.
“He came to the sideline and just collapsed,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff provided Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before being placed on a stretcher for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center hospital.
Harris added that “there is no information about the type of injury yet — and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt second year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the match, giving him a season number of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers may pay higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK, and the extra money is used to help homeless people, according to Tory’s new plans
The measure will neutralize Corby's successes in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The British Ministry of Finance expects to receive up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help homeless people, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The measure will be perceived as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby's successes in attracting young voters with promises of housing with more affordable prices and aiming at high-income beneficiaries.
The increase of the stamp tax will be taken out by individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK. The extras will give a shot at the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional charge is in addition to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on leisure homes and housing purchased to be rented out. It may be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will withdraw up to 120 million pounds per year.
An estimated 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by people living outside the UK, driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot on the housing market.
Many well-earned areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities due to the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new play will only come a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp tax to help more young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to refrain from housing allowances with affordable prices to solve the UK’s bad housing situation.
Jeremy Corbyn has launched a wide range of proposals for housing reforms, including rental ceilings and an end to bills without the tenant’s fault.
He also wants to give municipalities a greater opportunity to build new homes.
Theresa May says: “I said last year that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, that life will be better for every new generation.
This means solving the problems in the housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and also for companies based abroad, to buy housing as for hard-working residents in our country.
The dream of owning a home has become too many people a distant dream, and homelessness is still an invaluable fact.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to train Scotland.
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his “final goal” is to ever become Scotland’s coach.
The 42-year-old Scots look forward to the challenge of blowing life into the club from north-east England, currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a match in the B national team and that's all - Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
“But when I grew up I looked a lot at Scotland on Hampden with my father, and it has always attracted me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage to lead a club.
Among Ross representatives as coach of Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of the Alloa Athletic says that he was not worried about succeeding so established names in such a large club. He has previously declined offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Just now, I’m considering success based on the answer to the question, ‘Can I get this club back to the Premier League?’
This club is absolutely home to the Premier League, given its structure and talent, he says.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I’d probably just see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there...
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a period as an assistant coach in Dumbarton and a 15-month season as a member of Heart's coach team.
Then he helped Alloa get back from moving to the third division, raising St Mirren from being close to the descent to becoming the winner of the championship title the following season.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than ever during his playing career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
\"It was probably a reason for the road, he remembers and points to when he took command of Alloa.
“I really thought leadership was completely right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had good results and could live properly on it, and I had some great successes.
Playing can be tough.
There’s a lot to do every week.
There is still stress and pressure at work for me, but training feels completely right.
I’ve always wanted to exercise and now I do. I feel better than I’ve ever done throughout my adult life.

A survey shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
The heat pool of summer has increased revenue for the country’s struggling pubs, but the restaurant chains have been given greater pressure.
Figures showed that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but restaurants' revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of the corporate consulting company CGA, who has compiled the figures, said: “Awardly beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in the World Cup longer than expected meant that we saw a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the pubs went up by 2.8%.
The decrease in the turnover of restaurants by 1.8% in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that mainly offer drinks showed the absolute best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than restaurants had gone down.
Pubars offering food also had difficulty in the beautiful weather, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People just wanted to go out and drink something.
The output of managed pubs and bars went up by 6.6% that month, and food sales decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman at the serving and entertainment industry RSM says: “These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sporting events are still the most important factors in sales in the supermarket.
It is no surprise that the restaurant groups still have difficulties, although a sales reduction of 4.8% every year is particularly difficult to deal with beyond ongoing cost pressures.
The long warm summer could not have come more inconvenient for businesses run by food sales. Time may reveal if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August give someone well needed feedback.
The overall increase in sales of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July. It reflects the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
The industry sales supervisor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub bar and restaurant industry in the UK collects and analyzes data on how it goes for 47 active groups with a total turnover of over £9 billion, and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One in five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One study shows that one in five children, sometimes as young as 11 years of age, has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students at high school and high school shows an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
The result has increased the concern that sexual content is being posted there
20% of students said they had a “head account” as they showed to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years of age, creates accounts on social media that they keep secret from adults.
A study of 20,000 students in high school and high school showed a rapid increase in the number of false Insta accounts - a reference to the Instagram Image Sharing Service.
The result has spat on the concern that sexual content is posted there.
20% of students stated that they have a cleaned-in-chief account, which they can show to their parents, and so they also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled on her 13-year-old daughter’s secret page found a teenager who called on others to “violve me.”
According to the study, conducted by organizations Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistress Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools, 40% of children between 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them acknowledged that they had private accounts.
The president of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to creating places on the internet where parents and teachers don’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the athletes — in the board of the Scottish athletics association, Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as an external board member at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most praised track rider, and President Ian Beattie describes the election as an outstanding opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her wide experience at international level over the past decade.
“Eilidh has gained great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that the sports in Scotland would benefit greatly from her becoming a member of the board,” said Beattie.
Doyle says, “I want to be a voice for the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the Olympics in Atlanta 1996, has a total of four Olympic gold and is now an expert commentator on the BBC. He lost the ability to go for a mini stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: “Today a month ago I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time had to be expelled if I were to recover, and to what extent.
It’s been hard work, but I’ve recovered completely, learned to walk again, and now I’m doing exercise!
Thank you for all your encouragement.
Advertising for breast pumps that compare moms to where parts of the internet
A company that sells breast pumps has caused disagreements on the internet with an ad that compares nursing mothers to cows that get milked.
To draw attention to the launch of what is said to be the world’s first silent portable breast pump, the consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video-inspired advertising film with humorous estimates to show the freedom the new pump gives moms pumping breast milk.
Four real moms dance in a hay-filled barn with a song of lyrics like: “Yes, I’m milking myself, but I don’t have a tail — and if you didn’t know it, this is not a jewel, but a tuts...
The chorus continues: “Pump out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies...
However, the advertising film, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused controversy on the internet.
The film has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has met mixed reactions from the viewers. Many say it sheds light over the dairy industry’s phases.
“A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Just as we need them to become pregnant and feed to produce milk, but their babies are taken away from them just a few days after birth, a person writes.

Another comments: “You understand that it’s traumatic for both mother and child.
But certainly, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children --
Another one adds: “What a real-life reverse advertising film.
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is “hysterically funny.”
I think this is brilliant.
I would have gotten one if I was still breast-feeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The commercial is a bit crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product - someone writes.
Another comments: “This is a funny ad film that turns to moms who pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feels like ‘cossors’.
This is not a film that celebrates or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the film, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump incubated in the closet.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and can be worn discreetly in a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin is a partner and ECD on Mother, and she says: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women pumping breast milk and dairy cows, we wanted to put light on breast pumping and the challenges with it, while in an entertaining and easily recognizable way showing the incredible feeling of freedom the new pump provides.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump creates headlines.
During London's fashion week, a two-child mother appeared on the catwalk with clothes of designer Marta Yakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved in silence to a tent camp near the border in Texas
The number of detained migrant children has been high, although the number of people crossing the border every month is relatively unchanged. This is partly due to the fact that hate rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump government have made it harder to place the children in reference persons.
In the past, most reference people themselves have been paperless immigrants, and afraid to put their own opportunities to stay in the country at stake by explaining themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult household members would be required to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified before the Congress that the authority had arrested dozens of people who had applied to be reference persons to unaccompanied minors.
The Authority subsequently confirmed that 70% of those arrested were not known by law enforcement authorities since before.
“Almost 80% of people who are either reference persons or family members of reference persons are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to pursue these individuals,” Albence said.
In order to deal with children's cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to be in court within a month after they were detained, rather than after 60 days, as was the case before, according to staff at the centres.
Many of them are present on video links rather than personally to bring their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not deemed to be entitled to protection are quickly deported.
The longer children are detained the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to staff at the centres and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Proponents say that concerns rise at larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is having a difficult time are more likely to be ignored, due to the size of the facility.
They add that if children move to the tent town without getting enough time to prepare emotionally and take goodbye by friends, they can exacerbate the trauma many already wrestle with.
Syria requires US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegal on Syrian land, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and - will be handled accordingly -
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that “the war against terror is almost over — in Syria, where more than 36,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that the government of Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until we have freed all Syrian territories — both from terrorist groups and — all illegal foreign presence —
The United States has around 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly educate and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances are good for them to come home, accusing “certain West countries — to “dispersal irrational fear — which enables refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return,” he said.
“They are policing something that should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel settlement Idlib has created an opportunity to proceed with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement ruled a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had — clear deadlines — and expressed hope that a military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaeda-connected Nusra Front, who —will be wiped out.
The UN Secretary-General Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon the first meetings of a new committee made up of government members and members of the opposition, to draft post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set up conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee and said that the work of the Group would be limited to -the review of the articles of the present Constitution - and warned of interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the 2020 re-election unless his presidency ends in the past through impeachment and scandal, which many liberals are likely to hope for.

There are currently no signs that the viewers have tired.
Since 2014, the viewing figures at best transmission time have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and are nearly three times as high, 1.6 million, on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best shipping time, which is an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has topped the lists of cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers during big news nights.
“This is like a fire that people are attracted to, because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC’s drama-Designed Survivor, who is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed the Capitol.

Money from streams into the smoothest race ever before the mid-term election
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional districts receive lots of money. It is thanks to a restructuring of a congressional district that has made two members now compete for the same place.
This recently surrounded suburb district of Pittsburgh is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who was given his place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb campaigns against another member, the Republican Keith Rothfus. He currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which greatly overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old district was constitutionally changed to the Republicans' advantage.
The competition in the new 17th district has caused a campaign funding dispute between the major parties' economic sections, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee, (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a narrow win in a widely watched special election in March to Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That place had been held by a republic for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts had given the Democrats a certain lead.
The United States was considering punishing El Salvador for China support but then backed back
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with some resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama, until the participants betrayed the Trump organization's leadership team.
Officials of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs decided to call home the heads of the U.S. missions in El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama because of “nyss made the decision to no longer recognize Taiwan,” said the ministry’s spokesperson Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
But only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017.
The proposed sanctions, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
While the internal meetings continued, US and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
However, in mid-September, high officials within the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which in practice put an end to consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which will now take place in mid-October. It is a sign of how important the presidential administration considers the meeting to be, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. messengers returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson for John Bolton of the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three U.S. officials, two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal negotiations against the promise of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and also expressed anonymously.
Study history
The next inevitable step could be the special investigator Robert Mueller's report on Donald Trump's alleged abuse in court, which now has clear evidence for in public records.
Mueller is also reported to direct his investigation into whether Donald Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in its attacks on the U.S. election.
If Congress were to change majority, Trump would be held accountable to that church just when preparing to run again in the election, and perhaps finally before a citizen jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to claim that Trump will inevitably fall, nor his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, which will affect how far-reaching the struggle can be.
In 1938, German officers were ready to set up a coup against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath that followed.
The story revolves around such crucial events, and the inexorable advance of democracy is either speeded up or slowed down.
The Americans are now facing several of these crucial events.
What should we do if Donald Trump gives Assistant Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what will happen to Mueller's investigation, fired?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that he was allegedly proposing to secretly record the president, speculating that he would not be suitable for the office.
Rosenstein says The Times reporting is not correct.
“How should we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or whether he may take office in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, in the mid-term elections, will we vote for a congress that holds Donald Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, democracy faces a dark period.
But I don’t think we’re going to fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-lovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, she sent me to light Sabbath lights on the table decorated with the swastal.
With that as a legacy, how could I be anything but optimistic about the future?

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is an optimist for the meeting with Rapid Wien
Rangers receive Rapid Wien on Thursday. They know that victory against the Austrians after the impressive Spain match against Villarreal that ended undecided earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, until the 2-2 match against Villarreal. But he believes that Rangers can use the result as a leapboard against greater success.
“It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31st year old.
“We went into the game in the belief that we could get something, and went away with a point.
Maybe we could have got it in at the end, but in the whole thing, it was probably a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half and we came back in the second half and were the better team.
Now on Thursday, it will be an important evening in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough match. They got a good result at their last match, but if we have the audience with us, we can surely advance and get a good result.
Last year was very tough, with everything that happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The squad is good and the guys have fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put the last season behind us and succeed.
Women sleep poorly because of fear of pension savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear picture of how they want to be cared for, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people involved in the nationwide study said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
10% said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take steps and talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t talk about how you want it in good time.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how you want care. Your choices can have a great impact on costs.
Take help from your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance solution, a hybrid solution with cash-value life insurance to cover the costs, or self-insurance with own funds, if you can afford.
Create legal documents: Avoid legal battles from the beginning.
Create a healthcare authority so that you can appoint a trusted person who looks over your medical care and ensures that the healthcare professional follows your wishes, if you become unable to communicate.
Also consider a power for your economy.
You then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in your place and make sure your bills are paid if you are unable.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who falls into an acute medical condition and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready.
“It’s not just the economy that’s at stake, but who are the doctors,” Martin asked.
What medications are they?
Who takes care of the dog?
Make sure you have the plan ready.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday. It reports officials. The death rate is expected to rise.
Communications have been excluded, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to obtain any information from the Dongala management area, an area north of Palu that is closer to the earthquake epicenter. The earthquake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city's population was estimated at 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a management area that extends along more than 300 km of the north-west Sulawesis coast.
The management area, which is an administrative region under a province, had a population estimated at 299 200 people in 2017.
The pillars of the province of Central Sulawesi's economy are fishing and agriculture, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickelgruvdrivning is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated to Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongula have been affected by tsunamis several times over the last hundred years, according to Indonesia’s disaster management authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Also in 1996, Western Dongala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the circumpacific seismic fire ring, which is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesian Aceh Province on northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries. 226 000 people died along the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with magnitude 6.8 on the Richter scale struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck over the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with magnitude 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai Islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten metres was triggered. dozens of villages were destroyed and about 300 people were killed.
2016: A ground earthquake struck the management area of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: Large earthquakes hit Indonesian tourist island Lombok. More than 500 people died, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested accused of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for abuse.
Palin, 29 years old and from Wasilla, Alaska, was suspected of domestic violence, for lying in a domestic violence report and for resisting the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he should have taken the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin is detained in the Mat-Su county and is held against the $500 castle to be paid if the suspect violates the terms of the castle, according to the KTUU TV channel.
He appeared in the court on Saturday and declared himself “not guilty — when he was asked to state his position, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected of three cases of minor crimes under Class A, which means he can get jail for up to a year and $250,000 in fines.
He has also been accused of a case of minor crime under Class B, which is punished by one day in prison and $20,000 in fines.
This is not the first time Palin is accused of crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The fall is now being handled by Alaska's veteran court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of having committed domestic violence and of holding weapons under the influence of that incident.
His girlfriend accuses him of beating her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 after she had linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome, which originated from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity supply and communications are down, and death rates are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside the centre of Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Films that show when it turned to circulate on social media.
Hundreds of people had been gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palu when tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors claim rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York City claim the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist assassination that killed eight people. It is a rare punishment that has not been enforced for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a rental truck from the Home Depot construction and interior design chain to carry out an attack on a bike road along the West Side Highway in the lower Manhattan. He landed pedestrians and cyclists in his path by the attack, which took place in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov accidentally killed the eight victims and, deliberately, caused serious bodily injury, according to the statement of intent on the death penalty filed in the Southern District, New York.
Both charges may involve a death sentence, according to the court act.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was prosecuted by a federal jury of 22 points, including eight cases of murder to support protective activities, which is often used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as the abuse and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for “wide planning and intent,” said the prosecutors, describing at the same time the way Saipov did it as “above, cruel and inhumane.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage and loss - it is in the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York's southern district has not been charged with a lawsuit in which it is indicted on the death penalty in a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced to espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were both executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, who is a Uzbek citizen, showed a lack of regret during the days and months that followed the attack.
According to the police, he reported to the investigators that he was happy with what he had done.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack after watching IS movies on his phone.
He also asked to put the IS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He has not pleaded guilty to the 22 charges in the prosecution.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders who represents Saipov. He stated that they are “suppliedly disappointed” on the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to work on the death penalty instead of joining life imprisonment without the possibility of conditional release if the defendant pleads guilty only extends trauma caused by these events to all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's team of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to work on the death penalty.
Members of Parliament from Tories say that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the army of the people” today during a protest at the Tories Conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must “recognize the heat” from the Europeans when one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested that he lead negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Member Peter Bone said at the march in Birmingham that Britain would already have left — if Nigel Farage had been Brexit Minister.
However, the challenge faced by Theresa May in bringing the deeply divided supporters to reconciliation has been exacerbated by EU-positive tory members, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers agreement, alive during attacks by Brexitan supporters, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU itself.
Her allies have insisted that she should press and try to get an agreement with Brussels despite the setback, forcing Europeans and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and Kaos,
Bone said at a mass meeting organised by the Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted the 'spola Chequers Agreement'.
He suggested that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and had responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been at the root, we would have been out by this team,” he said.
Peter Bone, representing the district of Wellingborough in Parliament, added: “I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to flush the Chequers agreement,
He clarified his opposition to the EU and said: “We have not fought world war to become subjects.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.
Bone dismissed the allegations that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British would have changed and now want to stay is completely untrue —
Brexitan hanger Andrea Jenkyns of the Tory Party also attended the march and spoke to reporters.
The Chequers agreement is unpopular among the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in the party and in our electoral workers who are out on the streets and make sure we are elected.
Put away the Chequers agreement and start listening.
And she added a sharp message directed to Theresa May: “Premier ministers may keep their jobs when they keep their promises...
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that politicians must “recognize the heat — if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s about the trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to say to them, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with it.’”
In the face of the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to get our political class, which is close to betraying Brexit, to feel the heat.
We mobilise the army of the people in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain.
At the same time, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the central city.
A group of activists waved with orbits with the text \"Tory members against Brexit - after the group was launched this weekend.
The Labour Parliamentarian Lord Adonis of the House of Lords mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they encountered with a party app when the conference opened.
“These are the people who say they can have IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus the plus contract, for frictionless borders and free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's a clean father.
There is no good Brexit - he added.
Warren is planning a “Ordinary Thinker” to run to the presidential position.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that she will take a “ordinary thought about running for the presidential post” after the November elections.
The Boston Globe newspaper reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke of his future during a townhouse meeting in the Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticised President Donald Trump, and is now running for re-election in November against Republican State Representative Geoff Diehl, who served as Assistant President of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the subject of speculation that she might be on Donald Trump 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th city house meeting with voters since Donald Trump took office.
One person asked her if she was planning to run for the presidency.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government.
A person arrested for the death of basketball player Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 a.m. for ET.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to help identify a man who appears on the pictures.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead near Southern University campus early on Friday.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died of this,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via the 247 sports news site.
Wayde went between to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he had been on the spot and had a weapon, and he admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any incidents and was taken to the prison by the police in East Baton Rouge.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm long and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 starting last season, averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 returns per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the World Championship after team orders gave him a win over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes's team orders would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost hung out Hamilton on the wiper as he defended his position during the first two yards, inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the depot first and let Hamilton drive in the back of the blade, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes went into the pit of a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after a little wheel-on-wheel-action where Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside at risk of bidding for a double drag to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in the rear row and lay seven at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race and held the tires to reach a quick finish and drive about Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
In the end, he came in the depot at the 44th yard but failed to raise the pace during the remaining eight laps when the Raikkonen went up in fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team has done an exceptional job and got a one and a two, Hamilton said.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday, because she maintains that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court judge, is accused of sexual abuse.
The president, who spoke at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly address the testimony of Ford before the Senate Judicial Committee. Instead, he commented that what went on in the Senate showed that people were “elka, nasty, and lying.”
“The only thing that could happen and the nice thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry, nasty, nasty and lying,” he said.
“You see press releases and leaks and they say, ‘No, I haven’t.
I haven't done that.\"
Do you remember?
Did you leak, Dianne Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked it.\"
Wait a minute.
\"If we've leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything,\" he added, and imitated the Senator.
The letter with details of Ford's charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have come from her office.
“I haven’t darkened Ford’s charges, I haven’t leaked her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential as she wanted.
But her dementi does not seem to have fit the president, who during Saturday’s meeting commented on it like this: “I’ll tell you one thing. That was really bad body language.
She may not have done that, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president continues to support the candidate to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual offences by three women, and he suggested that the Democrats used the allegations for their own purposes.
They are determined to take power back with all the necessary means.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to drive over to gain power and control, the president said, according to the mediaite digital news site.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars probed Friday’s loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Belfast Giants received an early two goal lead through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie signed off for the home team before Dwyer restored Belfast Giant's leadership.
Francois Bouchard announced to Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season of Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind and defeated Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season for the two teams, and the Belfast Giants had won the three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford assisted when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the intensive first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the match at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie who declined at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Belfast Giants was in the lead at the first break when he made his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again acknowledged a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, and he secured the winning with his team's fifth half way through the final period.
Belfast Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, will play at home against Milton Keynes at their next match on Friday.
The pilot died so that hundreds of people on a plane could escape from earthquakes
A pilot in Indonesia is now hailed as a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people on board could lift safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are stuck in the sudden in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly floating control tower at the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Airs flight 6321, which was then on the starting track, could lift safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he thought it was going to crash.
He later died in hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian TV channel ABC News.
“We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We are shocked to hear this, he added.
At the same time, authorities are concerned that the death rate can rise to over a thousand people. The country's disaster assistance authority says there is limited access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The death rate is believed to continue to increase because there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the government.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in assistance and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance arrives with dead bodies.
I don't care about clean water.
Mini markets are plundered everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will meet there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
You are ready, according to CNN.
Indonesia was affected earlier this year by earthquakes on Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Airport crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man is missing after an aircraft crashed in a lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed in a lagoon in the Micronesia of the Pacific Ocean now states that a man is missing. Previously, it was said that all 47 passengers and the crew had been evacuated from the sinking planet and were in safety.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water when it tried to land at the airport in Chuuk Islands.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and what the course of events looked like.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane slipped past the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew in very low.
“That’s very good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to wade through mid-deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking planet.
He said the cabin staff panicked and screamed, and he suffered a minor skull injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who worked in the vicinity to develop a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to drive people to land before the plane sank in the 30-metre deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea for the past two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analysts draw up a timeline for the night when a woman is burned alive
The prosecutor's side ended on Saturday's pladding in the second trial against a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
American Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as expert witnesses in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used cell phone lists to put together the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber's movements on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several cell phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicts his previous claims, reported the news magazine The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber's cell phone during the time period he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he \"saw, because my truck was in Nashville --
Another contradiction was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone lists showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis for some time after Chambers' death, Chambers deleted text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final performance on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol believes that the hip hop has come far away from its origins in political messages and to attack social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hiphop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently received a boost in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
A black one again?
A child girl in New York is a couple because of dismissal after a “racist” text message
A child girl in New York is a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a misdirected text message from the mother who complained that she was a black one again.
The couple deny that they would be racists and compare the mood with “expression”
Two-child mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed dismay when she realized that the new baby girl Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived at her first working day 2016.
“NEEEEEEEOJ NOT A SVART IGEN,” Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman —illa to the mods — fired Maurice, claiming that their former child girl, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that instead she expected a Filipino woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day of work and sent home in taxi.
She is now in line with the couple to get compensation for the dismissal. She is requesting compensation in the $350 per day for the job she was initially employed to do, which would be for six months and where she would stay with the couple. However, she did not have a contract.
\"I want to show them that you don't do that,\" she told the New York Post on Friday.
The couple repudiates the allegations that they would be racists and say that the only thing straight was to end Giselle Maurice's employment. They were worried that they could not trust her when they had insulted her.
My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We’re not racists,” Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
“But would you entrust your children to someone you would have been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously...
Plasco compared the mood to “expression,” saying his wife was going to give birth to children two months later and was in a very difficult situation.
Do you have to go to such a person?
It's not very nice done - added the investment banker Plasco.
The legal process is still ongoing, but public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticizes them for their behavior and reasoning.
The Paddington publishers did not believe that readers would be able to relate to a speaking bear, revealing a new letter
Paddington author Michael Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter as follows: “It’s hard to imagine how it was for a person who read it for the first time before it was released.
It’s very funny, considering what we now know about Paddington’s great success.
She told me that her father, who had worked as a cameraman on the BBC before he was inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the first edition was \"bitterly\" after his death last year.
She describes that Paddington was a “very important member of our family” and added that her father was proud of his final success.
“He was quite quiet, and not a boasted person,” she said.
\"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds with something. You'll be proud of the child even if it's not yourself who has accomplished it.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he used to always give Paddington his own glory.
My daughter would die, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that you didn’t expect her to make it,” said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad saying that she would die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, \"I love you so much, Tashi, my dear.
I'll come to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The drugs the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly ebbed out and left her body.
She had died just before and now everything was shut down.
I just got to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I couldn’t chew or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get myself together.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, went aboard the plane along with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the difficult trial she went through.
“No one knew about it,” she said.
“I bent my head down, and the tears ran all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but on the plane I felt an overwhelming compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
The mourning women set up postcards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up cards on a bridge in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers that you can call for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering from depression and took his life when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to need to feel as bad as I do every day,” she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, telling her son was a promising chef who had a contagious smile.
Everyone knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smile lit up the room.
But he stopped working before he died, because he was in a very dark place.
Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his sibling when he had killed himself in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, “I’m constantly worried about consequences.
Sharon Davis created the cards to let people know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still, talk about it.
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, loses his partner since 15 years, Mark, some time after his mother's death.
“He had not said that he felt depressed or depressed or anything,” she said.
\"Some days before Christmas, we noticed that he behaved differently.
On Christmas day, he was at the bottom, and when the kids opened their Christmas presents, he had no eye contact with them or anything.
She says his death was a very hard blow for them, but they have to get through it.
It's gonna break us.
But we have to fight all the more...

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI initiates investigation
“I thought that if we could achieve something similar to what he asked for — an investigation that is limited in time and scope — we could perhaps get a little consensus,” said Jeff Flake on Saturday. He added that he feared that the committee would split because of deeply rooted party disagreements.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican followers want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their resilience depends entirely on the time.
The mid-term elections will take place in just five weeks, on November 6. If the Republicans make a bad choice, which is expected, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called Senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was a personal secretary to George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break his death and confirm his incumbent in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors under Kim
The number of North Koreans jumping off to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong Seug, citing data from South Korea's Ministry of Reunion, says that 1,127 people jumped off last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park says that harder border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher charges for human smugglers are important causes.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The majority of North Korea’s defectors are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fly through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China sees the defectors as illegal migrants rather than as refugees and often sends them back with violence.
The relationship between North and South, which is technically still at war with each other, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries of Pyongyang met for talks focusing on the determined negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work to free the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the American sanctions of the lack of success since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we absolutely cannot disarm ourselves unilaterally first,” said Ri at a speech in the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterically” and says he is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court
The Minority Leader of the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh-hysterically, saying that he was temperately inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosis comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had acted like that, she would be called ‘hysteric’,” Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the allegations of having sacrificed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotionally touched, and then and then he screamed almost and the voice stopped as he spoke of his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee, saying that the charges against him were a “gross and coordinated character murder — organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because it showed that he was biased to the Democrats' disadvantage.
“I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way in which he attacked the Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to put Kavanaugh before the impeachment if he is elected, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I can say this — if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he’s at now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that she as a Democrat was concerned about what decisions Kavanaugh might take against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade abortion case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his affirmations, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not the location of a hysterical and biased person to get into court and expect us all to applaud,” Pelosi said.
Women have to stand out.
It is a righteous critique, months and years of anger that boils over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's unusual.
And she continued: “I got good help from a woman who was CEO somewhere. She also cried when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she spoke to: ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.\"
And then she continued.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are allowed to discharge anger in part because they are often misunderstood in the basics.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs in a man-dominated office, where I once wept by indescribable anger, was that I was caught in the collar by an older woman. It was a cool boss that I had always been a little afraid of, and she pulled me into a stairway house.
“Never let them see that you’re crying, she said to me.
They don't know you're furious.
They think you’re sad and happy that they managed to push you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was encapsulated with an extra-marriage deal on a boat called Monkey Business and pulled out of the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder considered that there was no reason not to investigate the idea of running for himself in the presidential election.
“It wasn’t a well thought out decision,” she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates, the last one they needed was another.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since she was late, she was behind with the fundraiser, and promised not to enter as a candidate if she did not receive $2 million.
It was a project doomed to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $10,000 to men only gave her $250.
“They think I get a discount, she wondered.
When she announced in a speech that she would not launch a formal presidential campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect money and target voters rather than delegates, and anger towards sexism, that the voice stood firm.
“It could have been believed that I had a nervous breakdown; Schröder recalls the press’s reactions.
\"You could have thought that Cleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, ‘What are they going to write on my gravestone?’
\"She cried?\"
Why the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The opening tread of the trade war between the United States and China was deafening. The war is far from over, but the crack between the countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by coating important Chinese export goods such as solar panels, steel and aluminum with customs.
The most important escalation came this week, with new customs duties on goods for $200 billion. In practice, half of all goods coming into the United States from China are subject to customs duties.
Every time, Beijing responded with the same coin, it was recently spent on fees of between five and ten percent on U.S. goods for $60 billion.
China has promised to match US action. The world’s second largest economy will probably not step down within apparent time.
Getting Washington back means bending to demands, but publicly crawling for the United States would be far too brilliant for China’s President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards right, the U.S. Trade War press can give positive support to China in the long term, by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies on each other.
“A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions for economic panic in either country, and it’s actually far more dangerous than viewers have previously wanted to recognize,” said Abigail Grace, research assistant with focus on Asia at the New American Security think tank.
Syria-redo - for returning refugees, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says that the country is ready to receive voluntary return refugees and appeals for help to build the country, which is in ruins after the seven-year war.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said that the conditions in the country are now improving.
“The situation in place today is more stable and secure, thanks to our successes in fighting terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to build up the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that it did not receive conditional support or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe resigned with victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in line on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points required to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard during most of the tournament, ended up in the water at the rash of the 16th hole par 3 course, and lost to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shimmered in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever made 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 & 4 by the European team's lowest ranked player, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have made his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, who is a veteran with eight Ryder Cup behind him, became the most successful European ever in the tournament with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I am so happy to win back the victory.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be helpful, said a touched Garcia after the European team's victory.
He left the relay stick to his countryman John Ram who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in single on Sunday.
“What incredible pride, to beat Tiger Woods. I’m grown up looking at him,” said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France, and now has the result 13-21-3 for his career in Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the world’s best players ever, who has won 14 major titles, which has only been surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they’ve been fighting.
It was time this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the favor.
Hat off for Thomas.
He's a fantastic captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the U.S. PGA Tour and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're going to move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
You get to bug and bump.
They played better than us.
Alg flowering: The tails decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission shows a general reduction in concentrations of algae bloom for parts of the area around Tampa Bay.
According to the Commission, unevenr flowers are reported in the areas of the large municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier.
Alg flowering extends along about 20 miles of the coast, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee.
Spots can be seen about one and a half miles into the sea outside the large municipality of Hillsborough, but in fewer places than last week.
Alg flowering has also been observed in the large municipality of Pasco.
Average concentrations in or off the coast of Pinellas have been reported over the past week. Outside Hillsborough's coast low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations in or off the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations to medium concentrations in or off the coast of Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue to come from the large municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in north-west Florida that week.
