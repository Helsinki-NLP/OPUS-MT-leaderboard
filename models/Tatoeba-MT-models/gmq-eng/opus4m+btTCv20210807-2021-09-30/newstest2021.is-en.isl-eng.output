Called on the World
The Looks Like You Need Iceland is going well and screaming and calling out in nature has begun to pull people wide and wide around the world.
“Your own check, I need Iceland,” said a woman out in the big world in comments about a marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on YouTube’s YouTube topic.
One of the viewers said goodbye will keep Iceland in his heart for all eternity and a young woman says she has to come as soon as she first gets to Iceland's end is her lover settled there.
She is in the United States, however, and assumes to wait for a few more months.
Another viewer asked if the route to Iceland was good, because there are no planes.
Do not follow the story if it comes from a different time zone.
Egill Jórðarson at Peel’s advertising agency, which came to make the ads together with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says receptions have been hope again.
“I came to a lot of inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well, but this new campaign has already begun to take place.
Basically, this is about creating PR value, it is getting foreign media to deal with the campaign, and it has gone incredibly well.
In a relatively short period of time, we have received coverage in about seven hundred media networks around the world that totals more than two billion people.
The value of this review is valued at $1.8 billion.
It's not a bad thing.
The main market is equal to the United States and the campaign has been very successful even though the U.S. are not heading to the country soon.
According to Egils, markets such as Denmark, the UK and Germany have also welcomed themselves, as Russia, which is pleasantly surprised.
There was a reaction from foreign regions, such as India, which was not specifically set up.
“These ads have traveled beyond our expectations,” says Egill, who may have seen more than four million people on YouTube.
“We couldn’t have wanted a better start.
The images on this opening took Árni Sæberg, the photographer of the Morning Magazine, with the recordings of the ads entitled \"Let It Out\" in the middle of last month.
The roofs were wide and wide, such as in Reykjavík, in Reynisfjord, in Skógarfoss, in Solheimajökli and in a cave with Hjörleifshörður.
The director was Samuel Bjarki Petersson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson of the Scots Productions and the manager of Óttar Guðnason.
The roles in the series included the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, from Cuba and Hungary.
Ten Icelanders came to make the ads, but at the same time as recordings took place in South Africa, there was another group in West and Westfjords.
According to Egils, “Let It Out — only the first team in the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but the goal is to have a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
“This is just the first phase of this work for the Icelandic office,” says Egill, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has been extremely successful.
“It’s great to work with them.
In such projects, it is important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to --
Explosives: Talking about the position of the labour market, the pension fund and much more
Ásmundur Daðason, Minister for Social Affairs and Child Services, is in Sprengisand, which starts at 10 p.m. today.
He is also Minister of Labour and discusses the position of the labour market as such, Icelandair and more issues.
He also discusses rural issues and transportation working out to a country that has gone badly and has been divided over the past years and decades.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, the chairman of VR, also attends the show, but he will discuss his criticisms regarding investment in pension funds and propose ideas for working people's movement and employers to withdraw from the boards of funds to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
Then, Ivar Ingimarsson, a tourist official in Austria, and Árnhei Jóhannsdóttir, director of the Nordic Market Office, will talk about the status of tourism in the rural area.
They will look forward to the fall and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading precept for what is to come.
Listen to the show below, but it starts at 10 p.m.
This is how she looks 25 years later.
Elisa Donovan had a successful career in his youth career.
However, she had to play for her role as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also played in the Sabrina: The Teenage Witch and Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married to one child.
Little has been carried on her lately, but she got to look over the way and express herself on Clueless on a romantic television show in the days.
She speaks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
“I have to admit that I built the person most of all on girls I met at school that weren’t good at me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this person was,\" Donovan said about his game in Clueless.
I didn't want to leave the police station after the night.
About fifty cases came on board the police in the capital today, saying in the police diary that the matter was diverse.
The day at the police station at Hvarfisgöta began with the police having to interfere with a man who had then recently been released from a prison room after staying there due to a famine.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not obey the orders of the police who told him to leave.
The man continued to stay at the police station because of his performance.
A man was arrested in the morning, suspected of a break-in in a company in Kópavogi.
Police also had to interfere with two people in Breiðholt due to reports of body attack.
Then, too, a woman who sat at a shopping mall in Kopavogi could not pay for the account after the meal and was called to the police.
The car was also stolen in the city center this morning.
The driver of the white Renault ambulance looked at her for a moment, and was then taken in a free hand.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the League of Joy - The Horror of the Gleestars
That theory has caught the air on the Internet that a curse rests over the series of the League of Joy, but the actress Naya Rivera drowned in California in the days and thus became the third major player of the show to let life far ahead of age.
The features of the happy band (e.g., Glee) are a popular series of songs, dances and joys.
It was about a so-called group of young people in high school, their love and destiny.
It was not always taken out with the sleds to be in the band of joy, but through singing and dancing, the characters of the show seemed to overcome every situation that arose in their lives.
But outside the venues, great disaster has hit the players and employees of the show, so much so that theories have awakened that curses rest on the scenes.
Naya Marie Rivera took part in the role of Santana Lopez in the series, a clap leader who did not call his entire grandmother.
After the series ran its course, Rivera went on to own actor Ryan Dorsey and had with him his first and one child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and left them behind.
Dorsey, however, refused to file a lawsuit and the domestic abuse was dropped.
On July 8th, it was announced that Riveru was missing after her four-year-old son was found alone in a boat on Lake Pira, California.
The boy was found sleeping in a rescue vest on board the boat and was able to report to the police that he and his mother had sunk and then Rivera would have brought him back to the boat but never returned there himself.
A lot of search for Rivera.
The day after the search, the police officer in the area reported that we were looking for Rivera to be drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was officially found dead.
It is believed that she has suffered from heavy currents in the water and has made use of her last claim to save the child.
The death attempts were recorded drunk by accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith starred Finn Hudson in the series, the American footballer with the angelhood who played a key role in bringing the League to the road and respect.
Outside of the show, however, Moneith wrestled with a personal devil.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and proved difficult to escape.
In 2013, his co-workers on the show felt enough to enter and encourage him to seek help.
Then Monaith went to treatment and seemed to look for a better way.
Only two months after finishing his treatment, Moneith was found dead in the hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Banamein was found to be a deadly mixture of drugs and alcohol.
It was not thought that willful actions were being discussed.
Monaith had been treated and his stamina for drug therapy had decreased so much that the dose he had previously tolerated was fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was heavy on his associates, but his opponent, Lea Michele, was determined to continue taking the roles and dedicated them to the whole part of Moneith's memory and his personality.
Mark Wayne Salling starred in Noah’s “Puck” Puckerman in the series, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the League of Joy, or all until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles for the custody of children's clothing.
In his home search, he found a huge amount of children's clothing, and the matter soon asked out publicly.
It was clear that Salling had already been.
He was convicted and convicted of his crimes.
He had over his head four to seven years in prison, as well as what he would need to be on the record of sex offenders and seek treatment for childbirth.
Before the court had ruled the sentence, Salling, then free from insurance, was found dead near his home.
The murder was suicide.
It wasn’t just the players who fell from far ahead of age.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
He was soon put to sleep in 2013, only 41 years old.
We also won a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of the star Julia Roberts and did not bear her sister the beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of great governance and disrespectful conduct.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she struggled with severe depression.
She left her letter to her girlfriend, where she told her mother and sister, among other things, to be responsible for her actions.
“My mother and so-called siblings get nothing after me but the memory that it was those who caused my worst depression.
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of using her co-star alone and assault at the venue and of having an overwhelming star rating.
Jesse Luken played a guest role in the 2012 show.
He was arrested and charged with alcohol-driving in 2019, which was a huge scandal.
The actress Heather Morris played a major role in the show.
In 2010 it was discovered that unsolicited computer-terrorisms could be found in the neuters and published on the Internet.
Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played in the show and had an affair outside the show.
Benoist later reported that Jenner was using her as a harrower.
You can put flowers on almost everything.
It enhances the development of children when they get to play outside in the garden with their parents to grow flowers and get to watch them grow and thrive.
It is also endlessly possible to do with flowers as Swedish photographer Anna Kupel points out.
Just having a time with the kids in the park is something that never forgets.
They will remember the flowers, the scent, and of course the precious time they had with their parents.
Buyed a boat after 10th grade
\"I don't think we're many sailors working at the country's theatre schools,\" says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who pursues beach fishing in the summer but holds psychology at the University of Iceland over the winter season,
Beach fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you are studying.
If well fished, you can have a good income and I feel great to be able to drop out of taking a scholarship.
The income also makes me well into the winter,\" says Axel Örn Gudmundsson, a 25-year-old psychiatrist who is fishing for the beach this summer as the past summer.
Axel was recently brewed at Tálknafjörður when a journalist caught up with him late in the evening at the beginning of the week.
“The way I was in the 10th grade, I took shipping rights for boats that are under 12 meters long and I bought my boat the summer after I finished my primary school.
I've been fishing on my boat all summer since.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance Hartmann Jónsson, and I named the boat his name.
Hartmann was grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat had his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat,\" says Axel, adding that he purchased the boat for three million.
“I signed a contract with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of summer, and the other half at the end of summer when I had started fishing.
So I had the boat in debt at the end of this first summer of my life.
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay out in a boat when he had just finished college?
“I had put in and collected money, I had been working with my father at sea when I was a boy, I was all the summer fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my money in my boat fund.
Axel is born in Assad, from where all his mothers are, but he has lived in Kopavogi since he was a boy.
“I can hunt here on the west side because I have a legal home with my grandmother in Ísaförður.
I learned in this area of the west of the row with my father.
I’m going from a distance to a distance after how I feel, because this fishing area spans all of the Westfjords.
Although I feel best to be in the West, I have also provided around the Snæfellsnest and beyond.
I have also provided for the south, but the rather grey-release,\" says Axel, who always attacks one fire in the morning and says sometimes talk to the moon and sing for the sky, in the alone hours together in the ballistic ocean.
“The network on the ocean is good, so I can call, listen to the radio show and music.
I don’t feel like being alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid getting into danger, but certainly there have been times when something was going on, but never a big risk,\" says Axel, who is lucky that he is never sick.
He says the length of the day depends on how the hunters go each time.
“At seaside, I’m never more than 14 hours hunting at a time, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental room, but then I’ve been on a regular basis for a day and a half in the sea to hunt.
It is said that he will be able to hunt 770 pounds a day, which he thinks is a big hit.
“Other restrictions are that I cannot hunt Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and I can only catch twelve days a month, this four month of beach fishing, in May, June, July, and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their fishing days after the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on men to calm rather than have 48 days throughout the summer and can choose by their head.
So the division of regions could also take me for a reason, and the oceans that are well located with the fish should enjoy it,\" says Axel, who pulls most cod from the sea on his beach fishing, but also only the unsightly and unique other species of floating.
Axel works over the winter with the University of Núpi, Kópavogi.
“I don’t think we’re many sailors who work at the country’s theatre schools,” says Axel proudly, adding that he’s just meant to work at the theatre.
“I’m stuck there because I think this is a great job.
“I hope my Psychology program will take advantage of me at the school in the future,” says Axel, who has also studied business.
Errors in registration prevented homelessness
An error in a registration form that people fill out when it comes to the country caused an individual, living here in the country, not to be called back in the show.
It is not necessary to register an identification number if the individual fills the form in English, as is when it is made in Icelandic.
“This will be checked out this week,” says a specialist in the field of emergency care.
Three domestic infections were detected in the Department of Virology yesterday.
One of those who proved positive came to the country on July 15, two days after the rules of the so-called return epidemic took effect.
Those living in Iceland are then skied at the time of arrival in the country and are again invited to the exhibition four to five days later.
In the morning news, however, it was said that the person had followed the old system.
The show on the border was negative and it was not called back in screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfusdóttir, a specialist in the field of emergency care, says in a conversation with the news agency that this may be due to an error in the electronic registration form.
If people fill out the registration form in English, it is not necessary to enter a landmark, as is the case in the Icelandic version.
It was thought first and foremost of foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person has not been automatically invited to participate.
Kamilla says, however, that many people have followed the rules of home transit even though they have filled the registration form in English, and in some cases employers have also been alert to send people back to the show after it arrived in the country.
“It will be examined this week how to facilitate people’s access to this process to draw attention to it in the process...
The man is in isolation and six have been placed in custody.
They all went to an audition, but two were beginning to show signs.
Smatching is currently underway with the three infections detected yesterday, which are mostly completed due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, sequencing of Icelandic genetic analysis has shown that there are variants of the virus that have not been detected before.
In the second case, the ban has pointed to Israel, although it is known that the person who moved the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be there tomorrow where the other virus was coming from.
There are now 15 in isolation according to the COVID.
There are 135 people in the hospital.
Four of five infections unrelated
Five domestic infections have been recorded in the country in recent days.
Of them, four alphas are unconnected and have not been found the origin of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup sports tournament yesterday.
Smatching is still ongoing.
It was originally the third dozens of people who were sent to the hospital, but they were reduced to sixteen.
In total, there are 34 infections due to these new infections that were detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period of time that infection is detected at a sporting event and has raised questions as to whether such events should be held.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, director of the Department of Public Health, says it well, as long as people follow the guidelines and rules.
“We are constantly pressing for all those living here who need to maintain personal protective measures.
We also need to urge people who are keeping an event that there are certain rules that need to be followed.
“You can hold an event,” says Jóhann.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by keeping the air of individual infectious products.
In addition, the rules and criteria are in a stable review.
“What needs to be done, and what the Department of Public Health and Medical Care is constantly urgent to people, is to consider these individual protections.
Both at home and also at service companies.
People wash their hands and use alcohol.
This prevents infection from continuing, says Jóhann.
“We need to urge people to continue on the good journey we were on in order to maintain the results we have so far achieved.
40% off-lamba COVID-19 had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how hard her father had to catch the breath.
Her father had diabetes, so she encouraged him to seek medical attention.
The next day he was killed.
The death was caused by sudden breathing problems due to coronavirus infection.
The death certificate was cited as a underlying problem and is Brumfield, who also has diabetes, terrified that it will happen.
Reuters said Brumfield's fear was not reasonable.
A recent study by the U.S. authorities shows that nearly 40% of those who have died had diabetes 2 as underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached 65 years of age is examined, the rate increases to half.
The study of the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) included more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died of the crown virus during the period from February until May.
Jonathan Wortham, an expert in CDC's infectious diseases, says the results are striking, not least for those who are found to have diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
Were hidden in the slow growth of Reuters made a survey and pointed the answers from the 12 states that responded to comparable rates.
10 states, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet been identified from underlying diseases.
“Sickness was a slow growth epidemic.
The COVID-19 has been breached as a powerful age, with Reuters from Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at Chicago University.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American origin, who have also gone out of the crown virus.
One of the best defenses for those with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease in check with workouts, healthy diets, and the help of health care professionals.
On the other hand, the Koreans have made it difficult for many people to keep their route.
Then, the high price of insulin has forced some people to continue to attend work and thus to stop being exposed to the virus.
Reuters points out that U.S. authorities may have been aware of the risks that those with diabetes 2 could be caused by the virus.
When the SARS Korean virus passed through in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease and in the 2009 swine epidemic, this group was three times more likely to have to be hospitalized.
When the MERS did so in 2012, one study found that 60% of people who died or were hospitalized had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz scientist at Yale University says that because the effect of the COVID-19 virus could be longer, the passage could have cut the cover of a number of previously unknown complications.
“I’m afraid we’ll see a flood of problems when this is over,” says Andrew Bolton, the chairman of the International Association of Sugar Curtains.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus epidemic could indirectly lead to an increase in complications associated with diabetes, including kidney disease and kidney dialysis.
As a result, new research suggests that the coronavirus may lead to an increase in diabetic cases.
Reuters says researchers are trying to understand the relationship between the coronavirus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs, and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many people with diabetes.
Then, a high percentage of glucose and lipid in diabetes can induce a true “cell signal storm,” as it is called when the immune system responds too hard and attacks the body.
Damaged epithelium cells can also cause inflammation that can in turn cause fatal blood clots.
“It’s all one big puzzle,” says Dela Cruz.
“It’s all related to the inside.
The news has been corrected.
“We were invited to have champagne, and then they went out of the room.
The couple Ásrún Magnusdóttir and Atli Bollason received the unusual prayer from film artist Ragnar Kjartansson to engage in sex in front of a camera for works that the artist was setting up in Paris.
“We loved each other so it wasn’t complicated.
Atli Bollason never forgets when he first met his wife and grandmother, Ausrúna Magnúsdóttir.
“I was very impressed by her.
It was just the radiance, but I also thought it was unheard of.
“He’s still here,” he said.
This is also the first time the husband meets up regularly.
“I’m always hearing this story.
Last weekend, she also told her husband that she was attracted to the first day of her life.
“I found and felt so much excitement around Atla that I felt.
There’s a lot going on and a lot going on and I was fascinated by it.
Atli says the couple have focused on their relationship to go their own way.
“We don’t tie our bags with the same knots as our fellow travelers.
We avoid the rubble we see around us.
There is a possible reason why they took the era from Ragnar Kjartansson's film artist just a joyous one, though it would be most unusual.
“Christ Anna is in contact with us and asks if we can come to eat desert with us, Ragga and Ingibjörg Ragnar’s wife, at Snaps.
They were invited, greeted the three-seat on Snaps, and had desert wine and each dessert.
They listened to Ragnar who led them through his plans for a film show that he thought would be set up in Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the fall.
\"He had a series of films called Scenes from western culture.
He described it in a simple way.
Ausrún said he described the work as a banal and decadent late from the everyday life of the Western peoples.
“He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot, and last he told us what he wanted to know if we wanted to participate in...
Senan that Ragnar asked the couple to participate in should show young middle class couples to love in minimalian rooms.
“These are relationships with the beginning and the end,” said Atli.
The couple did not know much even though they knew him and him of them, but they knew us and felt fit in this.
They had words that they didn’t want to advertise people.
Maybe they thought they wouldn’t get the right people, but people who got sexual gain from performing for others...
They called Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn’t take a long time.
“When we walked out of Snaps, we said, ‘Are we just doing this?’
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnari as an artist and all his team,” says Ásrún and Atli.
“It’s about love and love.
Senan was picked up in a nice apartment on the Moor Street.
There was a very small film team; taken, Ragnar and the musician and the couple.
After the start of the recording, everyone left the room to wait in a car except Atli and Ásrún.
“We didn’t decide how we should be.
We were given some guidance, but we tried to forget about time and place.
Be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
It wasn’t the game, we just loved each other so it wasn’t complicated,” says Ásrún.
Was it romantic?
“Yes, it was a bit romantic,” said Atli and Ásrún.
“We were invited to a champagne before they left the room.
It was like being on a vacation in a nice hotel in Paris.
The team was pleased with the performance of the couple in the work that moved with them.
“When Tommi looked at this, he cried, he thought it so beautiful,” Atli said.
“It’s as much about love and love as it is about relationships,” says Ásrún.
The parents of the couple have seen the work and say Atli that his mother heard the voice of his son at Reykjavík Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
“Then she turns around and starts playing in it,” Atli said.
“My mom and dad saw it in Paris.
We hadn’t told anyone this, but my dad just sent me a message saying, “It’s fun to hit the little family in Palais de Tokyo.”
Is it possible that the participants in the project have deepened their relationship with Ausrunar and Atla?
“At least we’re still together, so maybe that’s something.
At least this led to a close relationship with the family,” says Ausrún and laughs.
He saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
“I found it hard not to be with you, but with someone else,” she said, turning to her husband.
“But it was nice to see this because it’s just a second in a much larger work and when you saw it with the other effects, it’s very nice.
I could get rid of it and I was just proud.
And there was a little bean in my stomach,\" says Ásrun, who was pregnant by the other child of the couple when the tendon was taken up.
“It was just beautiful.
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to the Ausrúni and Atla in Love stories at Rás 1.
Swansea with victory in the first game
Swansea won a 1-0 win at Brentford in a drama game.
This was the first game of the game in the playoffs to get into the English Premier League.
The game took place in Swansea, Wales.
The score in half was 0-0.
The inhabitants of Swansea received a penalty of 64 minutes, while Andre Ayew failed the Bogalistine of the Viite Point and was defended.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, the actor Brentford, received the red board.
Thus, Brentford played the rest of the game less and in the 82nd minute Swansea players used the team.
Andre Ayew then added up the video shirt by scoring a great goal and secured Swansea 1 -0 win.
Swansea leads 1 to 0 in the single, but the second game takes place on Wednesday at Brentford's home.
Posterless for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador to Iceland, is in the media after CBS announced this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard where he was afraid of his life.
However, it has not gone smoothly for the President of the United States to command ambassadors in this country.
Since Carol Van Voorst left the U.S. Ambassador in April 2009, there has been no embassy in the country for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst left office in a very special situation, but Kastlyn reported in 2009 that she should have received the Falcon word.
On her way to a meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the Presidential Office that she would not be honored with the word.
After she left Iceland, she learned international relations with Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor arrived in September 2010.
In some way, Robert S. Connan had been appointed Ambassador, but then resigned.
Finally, Loius Ariega had worked in the foreign service for decades.
He resigned in the autumn of 2013 and served as an ambassador to Guatemala.
Then we took another embassy without a time.
Robert Barber received the approval of the U.S. Congress in January 2015 and came to work shortly later, but no ambassador had been present for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed but not a diplomat, but had served as a lawyer and short-term council of Barack Obama.
He resigned as Donald Trump took office on January 20, 2017, as the routine is with a politically-organized ambassador.
Trump's administration was unusual in commanding both ambassadors and high officials in the Washington management system.
For two years until the U.S. Congress, Jeffrey Ross Gunter announced his meeting to ask him about the stories and confirm after that as an ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony to the Parliament, he said he never came to Iceland, but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who has died, had been broken by Dutch rock.
Gunter is politically organized, was previously a California dermatologist and has been prominent in the Jewish organization of the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded them, while Adelson is a keen supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter worked in Iceland in May 2019, but then no ambassador had been on the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest as an example.
The reason is both how long Trump’s rule was to appoint people in the key office as well as that over the past year the U.S. Congress has been working very long, including confirming ambassadors in office.
As of 2009, it has been an embassy in Iceland for over five years.
However, it has not prevented executions on the roads of the embassy that opened the new headquarters at Engadeig.
The operations are estimated to have cost 6.5 billion, while the nut walls surround the building and the bulletproof glass is in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have enough to fill the current ambassador's sense of security because he is said to be afraid of his life and has wanted to receive an armed bodyguard.
A former IBV player suffered racism in Iceland - “It was a mistake to come to Iceland.”
Tonny Mawejje, former actor IBV, claims to have suffered racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets coming to the country.
This is an interview with Tonny on the Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda Police FC team who played in the top division of Uganda.
In the interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny discusses a lot of things, including his time in the country, but he played with IBV, Val and Evolution in Iceland.
“When I arrived in Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle as I used to play.
The team’s team was in that position, but he also had the shirt number I wanted, so I got neither of what I wanted,” Tonny said, but he played on the right side of the game with IBV.
Among the things that Tonny talks about is racism that he suffered in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players will face when they play in Europe.
“This once happened to me, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Then I heard about it, and then I asked my friend what it is about.
He told me, then, that my opponent had a racist argument about me after I took him,
In 2014, Tonny from Iceland went to Norway where he joined Haugesund.
He said he has made the most of the mistakes he sees.
Tonny had not managed to get to Haugesund's starting team, but he wanted to play more to get to the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, and then he joined Val.
“It was a mistake to come back to Iceland.
I think if I had been in Norway longer, I would have had the opportunity I wanted,\" Tonny says, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway he would probably get further.
He wants to say that the loan to Iceland has ended his dream of joining the big team in Europe.
Meet a worm in a woman's neck
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found 3.8 sm long black worm in the neck gland of a woman who was looking for it.
The doctor was able to pull the worm out with a tongue.
A study found that parasites were being discussed.
CNN will tell you about this.
A few days before, the woman had eaten sashimi, which is thin meat.
The woman quickly recovered after the worm was removed, but parasites such as these are often found in raw meat or fish.
After sushi rushes to bed in the West, cases, where parasites have spread into people, have increased to CNN.
It is feared that another wave will begin in Europe.
Spain is now in a burning phase in connection with concerns about the second wave of the crown virus in Europe, where the government has taken action to restore the spread of the crown virus epidemic.
In Catalonia, all the entertainment life has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action due to the number of infections in Spain, but in the United Kingdom, all of them need to go to Spain for their return from Spain, as in Norway, and the French have been warned of their travel to Spain.
The disease is also increasing again in France and Germany, where governments are trying to find the balance of the virus's spread and the economy is starting again.
However, the state of Europe is good based on other parts of the world, while the incidence of worldwide infections is close to 300,000 a day, which is the most significant infection in America and South Asia.
Confirmed infection has reached 16 million worldwide, according to John Hopkins University, and deaths confirmed to be associated with the virus are 644 thousand.
The work of Moses finally gets to enjoy its fullest.
In front of the Toll House in Reykjavík is a large and deep hole.
There are men in there with orange helmets.
There is also a large tomb.
And more smaller work machines.
The gate is closed for traffic.
But the walker is capable, and there many of us now stop and observe the artwork of millions of Mosaic tiles —as they have never seen it before.
Maybe they’ve never seen it before.
At least not worth it.
The work has so far been fairly hidden, right in front of it were parking spaces that were always overseen.
People lay there, locked the car in a snare and then jumped off to their business in the city center.
“Live and diverse public spaces — and “attractive urban crisis” — are a guide to the restoration of the now-existing Safegate.
The aim is to beautify the area and allow the Mosques to make Helgadóttir at Tollhuset enjoy a better view.
In front of the work, there will be a square and where the area is well with the sun, it is considered suitable as a residential area for road travelers.
The artwork will be set up and now the material will be able to enjoy it better than before on this 142 square feet surface.
In the area, there will also be small, miscarriages — some kind of water sculptures, which offer a game and provide a certain mystery to the area.
In this way, the renovations are described by Reykjavíkborg, which is being carried out together with Restaurants.
Water supply, heating and electricity will be renewed.
Many of them have come to their years, but schools and cold water laws have been in existence since 1925 and have thus served residents and businesses in the middle of the century.
When the street is reopened after its completion, cars can drive around it again.
However, it will become a one-way street, creating a quieter and more accessible space for walking.
The Customs Manager’s website said the house was used in 1971, and its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Because of the passage through the house, 250 square feet of windowless wall flats were formed to the street.
Building committee and architect agreed that such flats would have a bad impact on the overall street image, if no special measures were taken to decorate the appearance of the house.
Therefore, the parties agreed to count by having a permanent work of art set up there.
During this time, a lot of words went out of the way of Helgadóttir, an artist, said in the summary.
She had done a lot of work in Germany and abroad.
The decision was first made to contact her before deciding whether there would be any competition for the work.
It had often been said that the work had to mirror life at the port, since the harbour had been the life of Reykjavík since it was made.
When she was talking to the artist, she had to get the idea of such a job.
It was agreed that she would receive drawing and other assistance before returning from her country, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
She was given the time she decided on her own, and when she returned home, she made some suggestions for discussion.
It was without delay to ask her to do the work.
Also desired to make a total agreement with her and the famous art company in Germany, Brothers Oidtmann, but Gerður had long worked with them to set up famous art works throughout Europe.
Agreements took place, and the work of the artist was carried out under the installation of the work of the brothers, who then saw the installation of the Customs House.
All the work was exceptionally well done, both of the half of the Helgadóttir and the Oidtmann Brothers, says in the summary.
It has been a long time since the Icelandic weather.
It took about two years to complete the work, which was completed between 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Customs House was completed, only 47 years old.
Preparing to transfer more companies to the country
Afsundur Daðason, Minister for Social Affairs, announces that more public agencies will be transferred to the country in the near future.
This is what the Secretary of State said on the Bryngesing at lunch.
It was recently announced that the fire department of the Housing and Manufactory Institute will be moved to the north of the sheep's crop this autumn.
Six experts in the field of fire work at the agency, but none of them intend to follow the agency north and have Landsstäggningsbäckningsbäckningsmättningar det átttningar.
“I think we should take further steps in this system.
I am preparing for further steps in this system.
\"More transport,\" Ásmundur said.
He is convinced that much of the nation wants to see more distribution of public institutions around the country.
“I think it is necessary to make further policy decisions about the transfer of public jobs to the country, as I was doing with the Housing and Human Resources Agency,” said Ásmundur, but he also took examples of other institutions that have been transferred to the country and shared a great deal of importance for communities outside the country, such as the transfer of Food Institute to Selfoss, the Land measurement of Iceland to Akranes and unemployment insurance on Skagaststrand.
All the most important things from the second day of the Master's Day
94. Iceland's championship in free sports ended at Tórsvell in Akureyri today.
A few tournaments were held on the second day of the race.
An exciting competition was recorded in the women's skirmish at Jórsvíll, while Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH put Íslandsmet in a sled in 2014, which lasted until Elizabeth Rudnarsdóttir of the IR added in May last year.
Vigdís won the Íslandsmätt back earlier this summer and has been in fantaform in the late summer, but it has tripled the Íslandsmätt what is left of.
Elizabeth Ruth has been struggling with injury and has not reached the stage today.
She had only one pot of five, cast a 25.69 metre, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the longest of all today, or 60.08 metres in her last attempt, and set a countermetal.
In July, she was 62.69 meters away from it.
Guðrún Karitas Hallgrímsdóttir from IR had the second best pitch of the day, but she improved her best performance by throwing up to 50.18 meters.
In the men's category, the FH-ing won Hilmar Örn Jónsson, the Icelandic mercenary, a safe victory, which he threw 73.84 meters in his next throw and set a counter record.
His Íslandsmet in the article is 75.26 meters.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, Olympiafari and the Icelandic Methagi in the air, won a competition on a ballboard at Thorsvell yesterday, but today he competed in a broadcast which is his main branch.
The Guðna Vals is 65.53 metres, which he threw at most 59.13 meters today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjállti Erlendsson was the last to throw in the second seat, 49.43 metres.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, the long-term Icelandic Methafen, won the long-distance race with excellence, but Hafdis jumped a maximum of 6.25 metres today, which is almost 40 cm from its Icelandic record.
In the 200 metres run of women, it was the IR-ing Gudbjörg Jona Bjarnadóttir, who was the most populous, but it came to a mark in 24.04 seconds, while Iceland's record in the article is 23.45 seconds.
Gudbjörg Jona was successful in Akureyri but she won two gold prizes yesterday, in a 100 metre race and in 4 x 100 metre campaign and then in 4 x 400 metres campaign today.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson of the FH was first in the 200 metres race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds before the son of Óliver Mán Samuel from Ármann.
Like Gudbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn won Haður gold in the 100 metres yesterday as well as in the 400 metres race.
Do not get fine for $27 million Bitcoin crop
The Board of Overtaxes has rejected the claim of tax investigators who demanded fines on a person for noting their capital revenues that were made due to the sale of the Bitcoin electric coin.
The committee concludes that the tax investigator had not given clear evidence as to why it was necessary to fine the man.
The Committee's ruling states that the Tax Research Director considered that the man has a record of the material wrong tax returns for the 2016 and 2017 income years.
He would have underestimated his capital income, which would have come due to the sale of the Bitcoin electric coin, up to 27 million, either intentionally or by a huge carelessness.
Put the man to death for his manner.
The man refused in a letter to the committee.
In 2016, he went on to sell electricity for 27 million.
He would have had a funeral in 2009 and 2010 when it had both been easy and cheap with a normal home computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the electric coin, tax had been imposed due to such sales were very vague and unpredictable.
It could have been expected that the public would have understood such measures in tax terms.
He would not have intended to avoid paying taxes on the harvest and would have understood his property in return as a deposit in the currency account.
He would have been asked by both scholars and the governor about how this would be done but without success.
He thought he would have to take into account that he was not born or raised in Iceland and would have lived here for only a few years when he began digging after Bitcoin.
Therefore, he would have been in a worse position than others to examine complex rules that tax authorities would not have made a clear view of.
The man therefore rightly believed that his taxes for these two years of income would be re-determined and strained, but otherwise did not punish.
He continued to work in Iceland and had paid taxes here on land since 2012.
He never intended to escape his duties in an inexorably way.
The claim for a fine would be out of all seriousness and would throw him into debt.
\"This man understands what football is,\" he said.
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been considerable between the teeth of people but also awakened enthusiasm because of his performance as a result of the playtime with Breiðablik in Pepsi Max department.
Flashes will be on the fire line tonight when they receive the IA in a live broadcast at Station 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur then takes out a play ban because of four reminders during the season and therefore does not attend a game with new cutting as in the games of the summer so far.
He had been written “bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, on his head for the game of HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
\"I don't know who exactly he was answering with the payment, but speaking of character, this one was better to try in the game.
He didn't go to hiding.
He wants to get the ball every single time and if there was anyone going to equal this game, I thought he would or would make it,\" said Guðmundur Benediktsson in Pepsi Max, when he was thought to be Brynjólf.
\"I'm supposed to be here for the people...
“It’s hard to figure out where he is.
He looks a little out the left when it starts to feel at the game, but he has a very free roll in the team,\" said Hjörvar Havjadason.
Thorkell Mán Petersson says Brynjólf’s real entertainment power and celebrates such a colorful man in the league: “No one shares that this is a character.
It’s fun and I love it with my hair, and to always be ready to attend and respond in interviews.
There is a lot of people busy with him, who tells me that this man understands what football is.
“I am a entertainer.
I'm supposed to be here for people and enjoy it.
The people are reading the interviews with Brynjólf, people are paying themselves in and watching what's next on his hair.
“This man is just a genius,” he said.
The actor KR says he wants to leave the club - \"I've been in contact with a few teams in the B division --
Tobias Thomsen, actor KR of Pepsi Max Division, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish midfielder Bold, Tobias is ready to return home to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to get to the beginning of the period in his home country, but to this end, he must first terminate his contract with KR, where the Danish division begins before the Icelandic probability.
The company knows that I miss Dankmark and have shown me a lot of understanding,\" Tobias said in a conversation with Bold.
“I’ve been in contact with a few teams in the B Division and will probably switch over before the end of the Icelandic season.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can allow themselves to pay up my contract with the KR.
He said he would probably have to take on a salary cut in Denmark.
“Fews in Denmark have probably felt more about the economic effects of the virus than in Iceland.
The bike switch Bjartmar has recovered wheels for millions - now responds separately after the DV review
For over a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had an interest in most people.
He wakes up and saves lost and stolen bikes, motorcycles, and bags.
Bjartmar has won the name \"the wheellifter\" for the week.
Yesterday, a large number of people came up with a story about their relationship with Bjartmar.
The DV then referred to the Facebook group of the West Banks, where it was stated that Bjartmar had taken the man on the eastern side of the island and said that the wallet could be stolen.
There was nothing else to read from the original writings of the electrician but that Bjartmar had stolen him.
These texts have now been changed to Facebook and the original news DV has been updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the initial news of the case is not at all descriptive for what really went on yesterday in East.
Bjartmar said that he received information from the victim of electrocution that these were indeed his electronic devices.
The information received was intended to be from someone else, but the information proved incorrect, says Bjartmar.
“I looked at the guy and I knew the skate, even though there was information that had been missing for a very long time and had been looking for.
I hesitated first, but when I saw him preparing to drive off on the shuttle, I decided to call on the man.
The owner was certain of his fault and I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I go very well on this issue, but before I finished what I had to say, the man had taken the word off me.
Bjartmar says that the man on the electronics just invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and himself called the police.
“Yes, great,” said Bjartmar, “let’s get this straight.
Then the owner of the electronics began to prove ownership of his electronics and started.
Later, the right owner of the electronics told the story on Facebook, as reported in the previous news.
In this five-year period that Bjartmar has spent time in this industry, he says he can think of the changes that he faced with people on the fingers of another hand.
“I’ve had peaceful relations with the hardest men of Reykjavík,” said Bjartmar, pointing out that bike thieves are most often the smallest brothers and sisters of the community, addicts, crazy people, and other people who are partly on the street.
“The company is a tough master and somehow needs to finance the next dose, unfortunately theft on such a looser is an easy way to achieve that goal,” said Bjartmar.
“My relationship with these people is really so good that I have a lot of the good people with me.
There are examples of people taking treatment and then looking for me and helping me with what I am doing,” he said.
In general, Bjartmar's relationship with cyclists is a matter of courtesy.
Some know of him and what he is doing and offer peacefully to show him receipts, number of bicycles, and so on.
Cycling is a major problem that has not been discussed.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that police are even beginning to point people at him out of stolen bikes.
Bjartmar disagrees with the previous news DV and does not say that he is a self-organized police officer in a personal search for justice.
Asked if he’s still not on the ice with his behavior, and whether this is not the first and foremost the role of the police,” said Bjartmar.
“Of course the police have to do this, but the fact is that the police are not doing this.
I have seen police driving away from a large pile of stolen bikes.
It is said that she is unmistakable in these matters.
“When the police aren’t doing anything in this, and this is just in front of your nose, and the experience has shown that I can succeed in this category, then why not, ask Bjartmar.
He says he has achieved such great success in getting up on stolen wheels, that sometimes he finds himself on his “shields” — on the street that they just had the Bjartmari bikes in which they had previously reached.
The time that Bjartmar has called for help from the police has occurred that she is simply not attending.
“It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault and it’s not the owners of the bikes to blame,” said Bjartmar, and I’m sorry that the victims of bike thieves have to suffer from the chaos of the police in this category.
The performance of Bjartmar is not shared.
Many people can find stories of people thanking Bjartmari for getting their property back to them.
Bjartmar himself said that he has long lost the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts run on millions, if not millions.
The weight of the electric system, electric bicycles and electric boilers can cost less than half a million.
Bjartmar works on a day-to-day day at a theatre and every other weekend he works in a community.
His bicycle search is the unprofitable work he does in his free time.
Life and Long Shadows
In 2019, there was a great birthday year in the history of life in Iceland.
Officials had, of course, received a pension from the king of Dana all the streets of the 19th century, but in 1919 the pension fund was established by officials who eventually became the pension fund of all public employees.
The basis for the current pension fund of general payers was then laid down by general employment contract in 1969, where a job-related pension fund was established with a mandatory membership and a valid fund collection from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were laid down on the basis of these agreements, and the livery system continued to be strengthened thereafter.
The payer’s living system was not the only radical change that the 20th-century labor movement pushed through its struggle.
Unemployment insurance had been granted in a similar manner in historical strikes in 1955, and the organization was gradually able to progress its demands on sick leave and medical care, significant holiday rights, shortening working hours, housing improvements, and more such as a great deal of time.
All these rights cost a great and strict battle but proved, after considering, much greater and more lasting improvement than the increase in the numbers of the Auras in the paycheck, which disappeared equally in the history of the post-war period and until 1990 as many remember.
The aim of the establishment of a general pension fund in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although people finally agreed that the funds would actually be owned by the social partners, the union movement had to agree that their governments were to direct the representatives of employers and social partners to the same degree.
In the coming years after the foundation of the funds, the call for the majority of workers in the management of the funds often came into discussion in the organization of employees, but it was never able to proceed, and so we are still standing up with the abnormal arrangement that representatives of the unions are not in the majority of the governments of the funds.
Article 36 of the Act No 129/1997 on the obligation to guarantee the right of life and the activities of the pension funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.
It says in the 1st issue that “the pension fund should have the interests of the social partners as its guide.”
The 5th issue also states: “The Foundation of Life should set moral standards in investment.
The shareholders' policy of the Life Reserve Traders include the following provisions, in accordance with the previous legislative provisions:
It is part of the United Nations Rules on Responsible Investments, along with many of the largest pension funds and Western and European professionals.
The rules discuss how emphasis on environmental and social issues as well as good governance companies can contribute to the improvement of investment-driven portfolios.
This brings together the interests of investors and the goals of society in a broader context.
LV considers it important that companies, in particular those registered in the stock market, set out official policies: to maintain good governance of social responsibility and environmental issues.
The life insurance fund, which has the largest assets of the country, has set out “a policy of responsible investments — and there are similar provisions.
This is all referred to here as the entrance to the latest fashion word of Icelandic, “shadow management”
Since the word is new in the matter, the hope is not that it has been defined, but I now find the following definition to be “mostly taken —: Shadow management is when the leader of the union says in the media that he intends to send the company’s representatives to the Board of Directors in charge of a life insurance recommendation or instructions on how to take a stand in a particular case.
If they do not comply with the orders, they will be expelled from the government at the first convenience.
If the leader doesn’t take this in the media and doesn’t talk about a statement, however, it’s not “shadow management — but there’s such communication between people everywhere in the financial world like anywhere else.
I let the reader think about the way he feels.
There are in particular two men who have tried to shape this definition when it is written, in the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
He is a journalist on the newspaper and Ásgeir Jónsson’s banker.
The reason for both was that Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had announced his intention to cancel the company's contracts with airliners and airliners (sold them up), and Ragnar Thor Ingólfsson, the Chairman of the Reykjavík Commercial Society, sent them out to the company's representative in the management of the Life Fund merchants, not to support the potential purchase of the fund on shares in the company, or to be killed.
A few days later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, and then Ragnar Thor went the same way with his recommendation, which, of course, was aimed at Boga's decision.
Nevertheless, they saw a reason to talk about the issue in Friday's Newspaper with great words about shadow management, crime and rich need for changes to the law.
There, a small doll would really have to roll over a heavy load although the blessed dove would have been in the connecting mode and was also dried out soon.
Since the issue is important, let us consider the material itself at the end.
I’m here before those things in the law on the life insurance system that listens to this matter.
In this regard, the fund boards should be careful to protect the interests of the social partners and have moral criteria in investment, and these items are further distributed in the approval of both the Terms and the Life Reserve of Traders, as I mentioned.
However, the pension funds are not intended to look only for short-term returns in their investments.
Such a course would be very dangerous and would not have to look for long for examples of such in the past, since large lending banks and fundraisers have run to immoral adventurers and environmental traditions, with tragic consequences.
Icelandair’s president was clearly on ice when he thought of drying out a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the goodwill enjoyed by the company in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Fortunately, he saw and brought it back.
Time reveals whether it is sufficient to allow the investment of the pension fund in the company to be held accountable to the social partners when it is settled.

One of the infected people did not have a home.
One of the three who identified with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the country from the Baltic States on July 15, last year, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelandic resident who is not located here on a regular basis and therefore did not receive clear instructions to carry out a so-called return inspection after his arrival in the country and to take another tour a few days after his arrival.
He had a negative view of the border.
“But he’s in an Icelandic community and in fact should go into that issue,” says Kamilla Josepsdóttir, a specialist in the field of disease at the Landskiller’s field, and a substitute physician while he’s on vacation, in a conversation with the News Today.
\"He used the English registration form and it is not mandatory to register the identification number and if the identification is not recorded, you are not automatically announced in the later view,\"
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually a foreign resident but because of his connection to the country that Icelander should have used it rather.
But he didn’t know about it.
“When your ID is not listed, you need to apply for it yourself for the second session.
Neither he nor his employer seems to have realized that it was the right way,” Kamilla said.
“It’s clear that we need to strengthen the information on this while we find a way to make an automatic preaching system even though Icelanders don’t record their identification.
Or, somehow, to make it more obvious who are participants in Icelandic society in the registration system, she explains.
Fortunately, however, few people around the country are involved, although it is defined as a participant in Icelandic society, remaining Icelander.
Only six were sent to the hospital after he was diagnosed yesterday and all six were in contact with him.
They are going to go to an audition, but two of them are beginning to show the characteristics of Covid-19 infection.
The man received a negative from his demonstration at the border on July 15th.
Kamilla says he was recently infected by the virus that she could not yet be detected in him when the vision was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out the fact that the man has been infected here in Iceland but not carried the virus with him to the country.
“It is not quite possible to claim that this is certainly infected by the fact that it is long ago that he came to the country that he may have been exposed here as these two that have caused a little control in relation to the sports tournaments,” he said.
She says that it is very unlikely because of how few people are around here.
“It’s really very unlikely,” Kamilla says, but states that it cannot be excluded until Icelandic genetic analysis has sorted out the virus in man.
“If we have a virus that has not been seen before, it’s almost certain that he brought it to the country.
Piper sprees and bombs used against protesters
There was a conflict between the police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police were using the protesters' pepper sprays and unbanned hand grenades, but the protesters broke the window and set fire to the fire.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racial prejudice were widely protested in the United States last night, but the Seattle protests supported protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot to death.
As the BBC says, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands of people came together in peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to the building area and broke windows in the courthouse of the city.
The police said the protest was violent and there was a conflict between the groups of protesters and the police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, 23-year-old black man murdered by the police in August last year, was remembered by protesters.
A car passed through a group of protesters in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of police officers came black together and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman murdered by police at her home last March.
The group carried firearms and went into detention at closed street conventions where police assigned the group from a group of people who protested and also wore firearms.
There were 75 arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters recalled James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man murdered by a white barrister in May.
Sunny: Not the game that defines our period
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, director of football Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of the game with Leicester today in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea does not lose against Wolves, end Solskjær and his men in 5th place and thereby lose out of the Champions' seat.
However, they still have the hope of joining the Champions League by winning the European League next month.
“We haven’t come to an end.
“If we get to Leicester, I think people will say that we haven’t had a bad time now,” Solskjær said.
“But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a lot in the country by reaching the two teams above us,” Solskjær said.
It is clear that people’s nerves will be different at 15 a.m. today, but Sunskjær tried to pretend that every other game was talking about.
“If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and on this the company builds.
We’ve created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it’s our use of it,” Solskjær said.
“This isn’t the most important game of the time, it’s just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The results don’t define our period, we’ve already had many hours to define this period.
“The arrival of Bruno Fernandes changed a lot for us, and I think we are completely in a better shape and much stronger spiritually than in the last few years,” Solskjær said.
65,000 infections in the solar circle
65,490 new diseases were detected in the United States yesterday according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed from the beginning of the epidemic in that country.
900 died from the virus yesterday, but in the last four days until death due to the virus more than 1,000 per day.
A total of 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
CNN reports that, according to a forecast of U.S. vaccine prevention, the number of deaths caused by the virus will be 175,000 on August 15th.
Fear of the second wave of the epidemic
The Spanish government is now attempting to suppress the expansion of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
No more has been identified in one day since the beginning of May and the news comes at the same time as the Spanish begin to remove one of the most stringent exit bans in Europe.
As a result, the British authorities are now obliged to bring in passengers coming from Spain to go into custody on return.
A week earlier, Spain was listed in the United Kingdom for a secure state.
The situation is what is worst in Catalonia in north-eastern Spain where governments have resorted to wider limitations to try to stem a ladder towards the growth.
In the capital of Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and the elderly will be closed at midnight.
There is now a ban on exit for 200,000 inhabitants of the Segria County, Western Catalonia.
It is believed that the decision by the British will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which is very angry at the arrival of foreign tourists and is ill-played after the journey.
Tui, the largest travel agency in the UK, cancelled all the scheduled flights to Spain and the Canary Islands today.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the epidemic, but little interest seems to be in taking back a large number of exit ban that has severely destroyed the economy.
Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister of Britain, has taken this very seriously and compared it to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Then Jean Castex, the Prime Minister of France, said that the nation “would not survive, economically or socially, if again seized for a ban on exit.
If many councillors hope for the local resource that reaches the population of a single town, city or region will be able to hold back the virus in the next round if it comes to it.
Five New Infections in Iceland - Three Inland
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday, as well as two more at the border.
Five people with positive Covid-19 infection were identified yesterday in Iceland.
The report states that one infection is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He has been sent to an isolation and sixteen who were in close contact with him.
The victim was involved in the social activities of a sports club in Reykjavík and is, according to the notice, “only part of the sports industry — in the case of the disease.
Others who were sent to the hospital are connected to the man in a different way.
The origin of this infection is uninfected and the full transmission of infection by the police officer.
ReyCUP Conventionors have adhered to the instructions and regulations of the veterinary surgeon and public protection that are still in force and have taken appropriate measures.
While the images of the tournament were growing, attention was needed to see in a very close association to celebrate the success of their team outside the field.
Just before 11 p.m. today, opponents published the following notice on their Facebook page.
“ATH: Parents, please respect the rules that competitors pick up their own daughter at school.
Parents are not allowed to do so.
Thank you for your understanding.
Another infection was detected yesterday but related to the infection reported last day.
According to the report, “Island genetic analysis has sorted the infection and has revealed a new type of virus that has not been detected here before”
In this case, infection also occurs and is infected in isolation and 12 in the virus due to the infection.
The third infection is from a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, July 15th.
He was identified in the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in isolation and six who were in close contact with him.
Two of them are already showing the symptoms of viral infection.
In addition, two people were identified at the border and are waiting for the results of further research such as a process of treatment at the border.
Finally, the notice states: The State Police Department and the national medical officer's office urge people to take care of and take care of individual infectious products.
If the Covid-19 virus characteristics are present, then the same person is asked to attend the next clinic.
Patrexfjord says the tent area booked for a shopping weekend - Direct guests other
The camp area of Patreksfjord is fully booked this weekend, according to the West.
Guests are asked to check out other accommodation options.
Hotels in Bíldudal, Tálknafjörður, Melanes on Redasand, Hotel Flókalund and Hotel Breíðavik as other options in the position.
It is enough to be on Patrexfjord this weekend, because as in previous years, Skjáldborg, the festival of Icelandic historical images will be held in the city.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a stronger tradition in the city.
From the attempt in the camp area to judge you can expect a good attendance this year, if the weather does not put a line in the account, but the DV earlier today said from a curious prediction.
Can you expect the worst weather on the south, and hope for the Patrex Fathers?
The site bb.is first said, saying that all other properties in the town were already fully booked.
A whole apartment in the best place in the city.
Romanian workers live free in Dunhagaga 18-20.
While owners are looking for a building permit for reimbursement, their purpose has been in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, most expensive districts of Reykjavíkborg, a beautiful apartment is located on three floors.
The ground floor of the house has about 600 square meters of shopping space.
Behind the house is the door of two staircases, each containing four rather magnificent apartments.
They range from 93 to 130 square meters, but most over 100.
The house has a lot of history to store.
It was built in 1959 and has also hosted a video studio, the School of Sciences, the milk shop of the Milk Trade, Joa gunsmith, fish sales, and now the last university printer.
The house has, so mild is the word taken, remembered its filiprous beauty.
The house is now under heavy damage, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18hf.
The owners of D18 ehf. are according to the company list of other Magnús Magnússon and Gudrun Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús went for the citizen group of Citizens and was the defence of the property company of Citizens.
Among the owners of the property company Borging is Stálskip ehf.
Stálskip ehf. is the investment company of Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrún is also the owner of third parties in D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, August Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once attacked a steel ship.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has little to do with it since then.
It is said that the house’s situation has worsened steadily since, but most recently.
On Facebook’s website, one resident said that the house was “not very vibrant in the last few years.”
There, owners may have a few years after changing the house and the land.
Other neighbors say the house hasn’t been okay for a long time.
\"It's a long time to do something decent with this spot and boring that it's pulled like this...
Does he also say that he is out in the owner of the house for failing to finish this, find some common flat with the neighboring house, and stop this “lawmaker”?
“Just do this in consultation with the community around it so you can get this done and finish it.”
“The legal app, which refers to the planning process, is the field that has been running since 2017.
The owners of Dunhagaga 18 and 20 were then granted permission to build a height above the current multi-storey building and behind the house, a new elevator and a building on one floor as well as a basement.
The building permit granted for the implementation was filed with the Committee on Environmental and Resource Affairs, and the committee withdrew it from the scope of which the implementation was not supported by a disorganization and notification was not sufficient.
The town of Reykjavík then started sharing the work and finished it with an advertisement in the Administrative Times in July of last year.
It was also decided and the committee withdrew from it in March 2020.
At this point, therefore, almost three years had passed since the initial application for the building permit and the owner of the house at the beginning.
At this time, the house had been severely depressed, and its neighbors began to get tired.
When the DV asked the neighbors about the situation and the reaction of the neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the house’s owners, others not at all.
Others turn anger on the city, others not.
Others were just angry, but nothing was wrong with anyone.
Still others said the parking lot, but neighbors have used unused Dunhagaga parking 18-20 under their vehicles.
One reporter said that he was tired of the administration:
“Let’s go through the process in three is incredible.
It’s like Reykjavíkborg couldn’t read.
Today, the house is empty, abandoned, and is neglected.
A memory of the sweat phase administration of the city and the noble hopes of the owner and many years of the work of those who are now at the beginning.
When the journalist was in a park in Dunhagaga 18 he blew up a crazy door and trash heaps.
Playstation computers and a recent TV were running around other garbage on Earth —the victims of Icelandic summer storms.
It was opened into the old university's office and there was a lot of cats of the smell of hell to judge.
It is clear that someone has been walking around in one corner, but no one is visible.
Stables of sofas and beds and some boards of geology journal pages, which would probably have to be a book, suddenly waved.
The staircases of the apartment were also open and life in both of them.
A journalist was so lucky to attack the inhabitants of another.
In the evening, the Romanians were going to have breakfast and invite the newspaper.
The Romanians work for Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and copy the sources DV that the company has paid nothing for the household but heat and electricity.
Due to the state of the house, it is not defended to collect rent.
From the post office in the house’s front door, it is clear that there have been a lot of foreign workers living there in the past.
An active employee's apartment has not been a part of the Covid-19 situation, the end contraction in tourism led to the contraction of the construction sector and these two industries were what the ability to make use of the services of the employee's apartment.
Nevertheless, homeowners in Dunhaga 18 have enough to do and possess the working spells and consorts in the community until the third after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the terrible condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist told the boys Romanian, he suddenly became clear: At the best place in Reykjavík, 1,500 square feet of real estate are downhill.
Owners want to change the house to recover and neighbors want to improve the situation but share the definition of “rewarding”
In between, the urban planning area sits on a starting ground, the victim of an endless appeal and the kindness of the planning process and the sweat phase resolution of the Committee on the Environment and Resource.
In the house there are Romanian workers, perhaps just those who go to improve the situation, when the Icelandics stop fighting.
It was originally released on July 17th.
In the fight against obesity following a coronavirus epidemic
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, will provide 10 million pounds in a campaign against obesity, which will include a ban on quickness, as a result of his serious illness, partly due to his weight.
Johnson announces the campaign, which has been called Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors are encouraged to prescribe bicycles for their shelters in excess of weight and will also be attacked in the fight against the increase of bike rides.
Then, an advertisement on television will be banned for at 21 a.m., according to British media sources.
“COVID-19 has raised us from the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the prime minister is advised that we must spend time becoming healthier, more efficient, and eating a healthy diet,” he said.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was put into intensive care when he was infected with the crown virus in spring, and it is part of his weight because he is thought to have been so seriously ill.
Women are better able to lead the changes
She said that the new constitution was the biggest step that the nation can take towards greater distribution of power, transparency and in working against corruption and the interests of the whole.
“We need to change gear a little now, and who is better at making such changes than the group of society that is easier to be in those values.
“There are women,” Helga said.
“Kons in Iceland are famous for their women’s relationship.
Standing together and being together to lead changes.
So now it’s just time for us to lead these changes.
She said she was a bit anxious about the focus on Iceland that “best in the world — in both gender equality and human rights.
“We’re not as ready to see what needs to be done.
As the Germans are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
That's a lot.
We need to know where we are coming from and know the story and listen to it.
Listen to the voice of the peripheral groups.
“We don’t all have the same rules here,” Helga said.
She said that women were in many ways in good conditions in Iceland, but added that as elsewhere, Iceland had a huge male value.
She said that politics was turning to form its own interests, powers, and powers, which were the forces that maintained injustice in all societies.
“People are now building this group and coming together and are just getting a little annoyed by the fact that the Parliament is going to move forward with this referendum from 2012,” she said.
“It’s this feminine value that we’re thinking about.
Based on human rights and conservation, cooperation, and that we are all actually sitting at the same table,” she said, adding that the above-mentioned value is the starting point in the new Constitution.
“We are a very rich country of natural poverty, and it’s ridiculous that there are people living in poverty here.
It’s ridiculous, we can change differently,” Helga said.
“It’s ridiculous that there’s something natural about women’s work that is always less paid.
It is ridiculous that airliners and nurses must constantly stand in a struggle just to get the humane reward.
You can sign the signing list of new constitutions here through electronic Iceland.
Trying to rob a walker in the city center
He was arrested in the middle of the night after he threatened walkers and tried to get money from him.
Police also stopped the production of drugs in the city where two were arrested because of the case.
The police then stopped the motorcycle driver in the hills where its driver was at 146 km speed where the maximum speed is 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of driving rights.
Police in the capital area had enough to turn overnight and were more than 80 issues recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.

In addition, police officers stopped a driver who took a caravan at Kjalarnesi yesterday.
The motorcycles were, according to the diary of the police, in a very bad situation, and it was still.
You can stay in Monet House for a shopping weekend
The house in which the Impressionist Claude Monet spent his last forty years of practice is now for rent on the Airbnb page.
The next free night in the house is on the shopping weekend.
The house is small and hilly, located in the town of Givenry, Normandy, France.
The painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
There are three bedrooms, two living rooms and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his gardens famously in this house.
If someone wants to rent the house, he must rent at least two nights.

Tugs of the disease and some of them begin to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five have been identified with the inner coronavirus in the last three days and most of the infected are unrelated.
Tugs have been infected because of this and some of them begin to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three of them were identified with the crown virus in the domestic world yesterday and two at border screening.
An expert in the Department of Agriculture said that the growing number of domestic infections did not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading widely into the community.
“It’s been serialized from the previous domestic infection and there’s a virus that hasn’t been seen here before so we don’t have any special reason to think that it’s been hiding in the community for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very well guarded right now,\" said Kamilla Sigríð Josephsdóttir, a specialist in the field of emergency care.
Most of them have been infected with people who came from abroad.
Further samples are performed in the near future, but some who were in association with the infected are beginning to show the characteristics of the coronavirus.
“Now there is no flu going on and less about other respiratory infections so we can be quite free by doing this test on individuals who at the time of flu had found a reason to do something else first,” Kamilla said.
Migrating is largely complete but is not excluded that more people need to go to the ambulance.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending a sporting event.
There have been questions as to whether such an event can be defended.
Public health officials say it is possible as long as people follow the standards and regulations.
Kamilla says that the infected have been infected at the sports venues.
“If there are no more people in isolation from these individuals after they have been at this sport, then we can argue that our pathogens at the tournaments have worked.
But it has not been revealed,\" Kamilla said.
The work of the Department of Public Protection is under constant review.
“We need to be ready to intervene with further recommendations or restrictions if it seems appropriate,” Kamilla said.
After more than a week, the number limits will be exceeded to a thousand people.
This new situation could have an impact on the process.

Conflict between police and protesters in Seattle
The city authorities in Seattle, Washington, have declared a state of rebellion following popular protests in the city center.
Police took hold of blast blasts and pepper sprays yesterday to try to clear a large area that protesters submerged and stretched over many mansions in the vicinity of the House of Parliament in the city.
The police reported on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that the investigation was carried out on a damaged operation at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
The city and police say that the protesters stoned the police with rocks, bottles, vault bombs and other loosers, and one police officer was taken to a hospital where his injuries were done.
Seattle protests were peaceful for a long time.
The bomb was sent to them to show protesters in Portland, Oregon, where the city has continued to face a severe conflict between protesters and heavy-armed federal police.
There, as in many cities in the United States, people gather under the signs of Black Lives Matter, recalls Georges Floyds, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, protests systematic racism in American society and demands compensation.
Not returned until after the vote
It is not yet clear whether the resignations of Icelandair, who will take effect at the next month's end, will be revoked.
The direct vote on the charter agreement of the Icelandic Air Freight Company for Iceland's airline fleet ends at noon tomorrow.
Gudlaug Liney Jóhannsdóttir, the Chairman of the Society, says that Icelandair will not make a decision on the statements until the outcome of the vote.
“It’s pretty close together,” says Gudlaug Liney.
“There has been no recall, this must be done so that the machines can be machined.
Of course, people are anxious to know if they will be working after the month-to-day.
The contract was signed a week ago, on July 19th.
It is expected that he will enter into force until the end of September 2025 and will be based on a contract previously signed by airliners.
On 17 July, the Board of Directors and the Council of the Airlines Association of Iceland decided to announce Iceland's all-arming headquarters, which members agreed to do in a vote.
Never came to her, but this was decided following Icelandair's decision to cancel talks with the airline, terminate all his airliners, and search for agreements with another union.
The company’s pilots were to take on the work of a small group on board temporarily.
Asking how she thinks the vote will go, Gudlaug Liney says hard to say about it.
\"People are in pain after this operation of Icelandair, when all the airline's airline's airline's airline was terminated and announced that the agreement would be with another union.
Now it’s clear if it has an impact,” she says.
At the end of April, 940 airliners were working at Icelandair, which was 900, about 95%, cancelled.
Their resignation is a misconception, with those who have the longest working life, three months, ending it about a month-long July-August.
This group has around 90% of Icelandair's aircraft.
What does the contract not accept?
“We want to continue to discuss with our partners.
With this agreement, we are meeting the requirements of Icelandair.
If he is denied, it is clear that the pilots have gone too far.
The vote on the vote will end and Icelandair will present a second annual resolution tomorrow.
The vote will end at 12 noon tomorrow.
The settlement of Icelandair for another quarter will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary results suggest that the company’s income has decreased 85 percent from the same period last year.
The electronic vote on the charter agreement of the Icelandic Airlines Association and the Association of Occupational Life for Icelandair began on Wednesday, July 22, and ends tomorrow, Monday, July 27, at noon.
Those who may vote for the contract are Icelandair employees who pay social expenses to the airline company.
Icelandair and the FFI signed a new charter on Sunday, July 19, but Friday before, Icelandair had given up negotiations with the company after the airline's pilots collapsed the previous contract in voting in early July.
Then Icelandair had told all the airline's airliners and airliners on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new agreement was signed.
According to a new agreement, air travelers need to fly five hours more per month for the same basic prize.
The agreement is valid until the year 2025, which has been integrated into the provisions of the pilots and the flight crew for how long to fly on one guard.
The agreement was presented to the members of the FFI at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday and declared many airliners who spoke to the news agency over dissatisfaction due to the agreement.
However, most people agreed that it would be necessary to accept the contract to keep the FFI alive.
The settlement of Icelandair for another quarter will be presented tomorrow while the EBIT company's operating income for the financial sector and taxes, according to the preliminary extremation of the company, is negative for about 100 to 110 million U.S. dollars or about 15 billion Icelandic kroner.
Icelandair sent the Copenhagen Stock Exchange an interim calculation last Wednesday, saying that the company’s income has amounted to $60 million in the quarter or about $8.3 billion.
The amount of money and the equivalent of it was about $154 million at the end of the quarter, about $21 billion.
Icelandair also aims to provide the company's shares in August.
Icelandair aims to complete contracts with fifteen loan certificates, government and Boeing aircraft manufacturers before the end of the month before entering part-time offers.
New variant rather than new type of virus
“New viruses just mean it’s been a person who came from abroad.
“It’s not something that’s been brewing in the interior,” says Már Kristjánsson, head of the hospital’s infectious disease department, saying that “a new type of virus has been identified here in the country.
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One who had been identified had been involved in the social work of a sports club at the Rey Cup football competition, but the origin of the infection is undiscovered and contagious.
In addition, an individual who arrived in the country on July 15 and has two people who were in association with him began to show the characteristics of COVID-19.
There was a diagnosis of infection in yesterday's disease that was reported last day and after a serial analysis of Icelandic genetic analysis, \"a new type of virus that has not been detected before\"
Infection is completed in connection with that infection.
It can be said that it is not a new virus, but it is the same virus and has spread around the world, i.e. the new crown virus SARS-CoV-2.
It is better to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asking what it contains and whether it could say something about the beginning of another epidemic, Már says that as is a single case, it could happen so that nothing more will happen.
“But if there are cases within the world that do not have a connection from abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant, then it could be concluded [in the second wave], but it is premature that such support,” explains Már.
The Hot Tub
Is the secret to the happiness of Icelanders hidden in the hot tubs?
The BBC’s agendas lead to the likes of a fun video that sheds light on the swimming pool and hotspot culture of the country.
The Icelandic bath industry is particularly popular in the world, and there are no such places in the world as many bathrooms in every city.
The natural earth heat is the foundation of it, but also the tradition of swimming that is here.
The children's health education was legal in 1940, but older citizens are no less able to use hot water for health benefits.
Swimming is described as a fixed part of the country’s overall well-being.
In the pot all are equal, regardless of the class and the position.
Accessed the cell phones, people talk together about personal notes about home and space or the use of the similar power of the water: meditate and charge the batteries of souls and bodies.
To pick up a hundred days in elections
There are hundreds of days until the U.S. elects president for four years.
Donald Trump is looking for a re-election, but he has the steeple to pick up.
Joe Biden, the prospective Democratic Party candidate, has a great deal of advance on Trump on a national scale, taking into account the opinion polls.
According to a recent survey by the U.S. news agency, the number of U.S. journalists is saying that the nation is on the wrong path.
Trump’s reaction to the modern-day pandemic of the new crown virus is also very unpopular and in addition, more Americans believe that the president has held economics badly.
In fact, only two out of 10 Americans say the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say they support Trump’s response to the epidemic, and 48 percent say he’s kept up with economic issues.
In March, it was 56 percent, and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the average FiveThirtyEight, Biden is 49.9 percent on land but follows Trump 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to draw attention from his performance towards the ship, push a so-called cultural divide, and announce policies that should turn to law and order.
Biden’s offer, however, is very keen to keep the attention to Trump and considers it a great chance to win if the election is really about how Trump has been working in the last four years.
The opposition Trump also seems to have come down to the Republican Party's members and fear that Democrats might even reach the majority of the U.S. Senate's Senate's members, who have so far been very strong.
Politico told us in the days to keep up with groups and candidates comparable and that is now the Republican Party would have its largest discount for decades.
Extremity has been particularly bad in the 2016 presidential elections and now looks like that development will continue.
Trump in recent days has tried to scare the inhabitants of the rural world to follow them, including by saying that he will be President Biden, he will destroy the U.S. foreign lands and push for racial conflicts.
Among other things, Trump has dropped regulations from the time Barack Obama in the White House, which was intended to increase the diversity of rural areas.
He then urged “homewives, foreigners, to read an article by former New York City Assistant President, claiming that Biden would destroy the U.S. outland and take Trump under it.
“Biden will ruin your neighborhoods and the American dream.
I will keep it, and even make it even better,” the president said.
The population of the U.S. is an increasingly growing group of electors.
According to the NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was reelected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of the vote of this group has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received a majority vote from this group but lost for Barack Obama.
The surveyors have shown that despite the fact that Trump secured a narrow majority in the rural areas of 2016, his follow-up there has drawn significantly together.
Although there is a difference between the surveys, Biden has estimated about fifteen percent-hour fronts on Trump in the outsours of the past.
Regis Philbin is dead
American television broadcaster Regis Philbin is dead, 88 years old.
Philbin worked as an actor, director, presenter and singer for about six decades.
He is the only one known for managing the popular live! chat episodes with Regis from 1988 to 2011 together with Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
He has also directed roles such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
According to Guinness World Records, Philbin is the person who has been the most hour on American television and has received the recognition of that content.
He won the six Emmy Awards in his career and was nominated 37 times.
According to a statement from his family, Philbin died of natural hurricanes.
The number of partners, friends, and fans has reminded him of the social media of the last 24 hours.
Will the Olympic fire be light at the end of the corridors?
After the final decision had been made to postpone the Olympic Games, events that only world wars have held up to this point, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic Fire would be famous “the light at the end of the corridors,” and there presumably referred to in the pandemic of the crown virus that the world is now passing through in unity.
Africans have additional years to prepare themselves and Japan’s authorities have added costs due to the delay.
Everyone has a big head on the line.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue of the Olympic Games this year, the joy of the Japanese representatives was genuine.
They cried and laughed for a time, and Tokyo had applied to hold the games in 2016 but did not lie that time in lower hands for Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan were going to take a bath in the world’s attention.
The games were scheduled for 24 July to 9 August, but have been postponed this year and started on 23 July 2021 and ended on 8 August.
If you can’t keep the games, if the crown virus is still too big a threat, the players will be stopped.
No one wants to think that thought to the end.
Olympics are not a regular sport competition.
Nothing is saved, the show should always be magnificent and strive to top the last game.
The selection of a city for Olympic Games is based on the assessment of electoral committees on the presentations of the cities.
The greater the potential of the show —the greater the chance of a shock.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to hold the 2016 Olympic Games or worth more than $20 billion.
For the next time, when the game was applied for in 2020, $75 million, about $10 billion, was added to the show.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo had been given the players this year, the Japanese authorities had been defending up to $30 billion for the project.
But that amount is only a drop in the ocean according to the cost of building an Olympic village, stadiums and in general to strengthen the interior of the country to deal with such tournaments, prepare it and keep the players themselves.
Japan’s planners have said that the Olympic Games in Tokyo, which should have been underway these days but have been delayed for one year due to the crown virus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
A report from a Japanese government accountant published at the end of last year found that the cost was twice that number.
It may not be possible to complete the cost of delaying the games, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost of the Japanese Olympic Committee and the Japanese taxpayers could therefore run from 15 to 30 billion dollars.
There are so many figures that all the tax revenue of the Icelandic state only earned half of the Olympic Games, based on the lowest possible cost.
The Olympic Games are an event of the magnitude that they tend to have been featured by economists, who try to look at the benefits and benefits of the games.
In the last case, quite a few people have found that the effects of the Olympic Games are less than positive for the economy of those who keep them.
Short-term effects are some, for example, increasing jobs very much for a short period of time, but for a long period of time, cities tend to sit up with debt and terrible operating costs of little used people.
Rios in Brazil are up with a significant debt due to the 2016 games and have been in trouble with costing maintenance on all the major sports fans built for the players.
It has been reported that only 10 percent of those who were employed in the Olympics in the city were unemployed before.
This means that it was not about talking about new jobs except to a small extent.
In general, cities have not gotten very well out of keeping Olympics because of the striking cost of the human activities built for the players.
However, it is often considered to be an increase in the circulation of tourists who want to visit the cities of Olympia following the games, though there is a great deal of uncertainty about the players 2021.
It is also unclear if all the audiences who normally attend the games will be accepted.
The main thing is, however, the honor that the cities have been given to be elected, but it is difficult to appreciate money.
Therefore, despite the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy that the players bring is not the nature of placing on it the price.
But if the show is great and there’s no saving, it’s not just about money.
It is the sport heroes who are in the foreground.
For some Africans, it’s just a surprise to postpone the games.
For example, the Australian five-threat woman and gold winner in their article on the Olympic Games page, Chloe Esposito, is a casole and would have been far from a good game this summer but he hopes to be in a competition form for the 2021 players.
She is therefore among the athletes who are just rather happy with the deadline, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who were planning to quit after the games this year, they would have been held at the right time, meaning in some cases that they quit the competition before the games take place.
Simply don’t trust your body to go through years in addition to strict exercises.
Few athletes were equally impressed in the hearts of the viewers at the 2016 Rio Olympics and Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has been attending some interviews in his country of America recently to discuss the Olympic Games.
She plans to play in 2021, but she is not sure if she will be at the top of the game in the next year, and she will be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered high age, it is in a higher order for a fiddler in the top row.
\"This is a sensitive issue,\" Biles said, but smiles at another interview published on the Olympic Committee’s Instagram website asked whether she is going to achieve the 2021 games as long as she did in Rio 2016.
“I don’t know if I’ll still be on top after a year in addition to training,” Biles said.
She has previously said that her body does not tolerate the stress that comes with a lot of exercise anymore.
Nevertheless, she is training for the 2021 Olympic Games.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to stop suddenly exercising when the world's peak was at the top and the gym was closed.
There were no exceptions for Biles rather than others while all athletes were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic gold could not buy any access beyond the others, she needed to find various ways to stay in shape like others.
The basics are much better than most people.
“We have a strict plan now.
It was hard to start practicing first after the gym opened.
We started slowly but have come to a full start and I am going to increase my workouts as it feels this year.
Of course, we don’t know exactly what these games will be like or whether they’ll be held, but we still practice because they’ll be, can’t do anything else.
“I’ve worked too hard to leave the sport now,” Biles said.
With it, like more flashing doubt or perhaps more aware that the position can come up that the games will not be held at all in 2021, either.
But to think about it is hopeless.
No one can know what the place of the world-famous crown virus will be like in July 2021 and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympic Games because they will be held this year.
Perhaps the Olympics will be light at the end of the Covid walk.
The Last Wedding for an Episode
Modern family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the crown virus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette, Wells Adams, this summer.
“I think there are more important things to think about now,” the actress said in a conversation with People.
“We want to get married some time and have the dream wedding and have all the people who love us.
But we decided to put it on time and focus on what is important now and it is to help share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying home.
I look more at world affairs than weddings these days.
There’s a lot going on and we should focus on what’s going on in the world.
