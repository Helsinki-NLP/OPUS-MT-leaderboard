Welsh members of the parliament are afraid not to be taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly were recently dismayed by a proposal to change names from aassembly Member or AM (Member of the Welsh Parliament or MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reaction came due to plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
Members of several political parties are concerned that they can be laughtered.
A Labour member said his group is concerned about your \"MWP rims on Twp and Pwp\"
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, \"twp\" means foolish and \"pwp\" pash.
A member of the Plaid Party said that the group \"is not satisfied\" and has proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative member said his group has an \"open mind\" in terms of the name change, but added that MWP is not far from the word \"muppet\".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced not unlike the English Yorkshire dialect's pronunciation of the letter u.
The National Assembly's delegation, now writing bill to introduce the name change, said: \"The final decision on which members of the National Assembly should be named will of course be up to members themselves.\"
A 2017 Welsh official decision gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the naming proposals which demonstrated great support for calling the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of national assembly members, the delegation prefers Welsh Member of Parliament or WMP, while the MWP election received the most support during the public hearing.
The National Assembly members have allegedly made other proposals, but the struggle to agree has given the leader of the delegation, Elin Jones, the main work. She will deliver the bill in a couple of weeks.
The legislation of the reforms contains other changes to how the delegation should function also, including rules on disqualification of assembly members and the design of a committee system.
Assembly members will be able to vote on what to call when discussing the bill.
Macedonians dare to change the name of the country
The voters are scheduled on Sunday to voice over whether to change the name of their country to \"Republic of North Macedonia.\"
The people's rejection was decided to resolve a conflict that has been taking place for many decades with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of neighbouring in the north represents a claim to the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia's membership applications to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said that he is going to look away from the result.
Those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price of becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks in Saint Martin silence while the churches in Harlem, New York, strive
\"The old I've talked to said that in old days it was a bar and a church on each corner,\" Adams said.
\"Today there are none of the parts.\"
He said he understands why the bars disappear.
\"People socialize in other ways now to day,\" he said.
\"Bares are no longer standing in the neighborhood that people visit to normal.\"
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from selling the property domains will not last as long as the leaders believe, \"and sooner or later they are back where they started.\"
He added that churches can be replaced by cooperatives filled with the kind of people who don't care to help the historic sites of the neighborhood.
\"The vast majority of people who buy cooperatives in these buildings are white,\" he said. \"and so comes the day when all the churches are closed, because it is unlikely that these people who move into the cooperatives will become members of these churches.\"
Both churches were built by white parish before Harlem became a black township - Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin Church a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congress moved out in the 1930s.
A black parish that had announced nearby, moved into the building.
Saint Martin was taken over by a black sock hired by pastor John Howard Johnson, who also hired the boycott of the shops in 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem where the owners opposed to adding or promoting responded.
The building suffered major injuries in a fire in 1939, but when pastor Johnson's followers planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a new bell game.
Pastor David Johnson, Johnson's son senior and successor in Saint Martin, was proud and called the bell game \"the bells of the poor.\"
The expert who played the bell game in July called it something else: \"A cultural tax\" and \"a historical instrument that cannot be replaced.\"
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the first watch game in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who leaves the church to play on the larger clock game in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that Saint Martin did not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in Saint Martin in recent months has become a complicated account of architects and building workers, some of them added by the leaders of the laity in the church, and others of the Episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, which hires the parish and consists of the leaders of the lay people, wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese \"would ask the sacristy to pay,\" although the sacristy was not involved in the diocese's addition of architects and building workers.
Some of the members of the parish have complained of the lack of openness from the diocese.
13-year-old damage of shark during hummar diving in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday while diving for hops in California on the opening day of the Hummar season.
Take her just before 7 a.m. in the morning near the Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented to KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning hearing that the boy cried for help. He paddled away to the boy with a group and pulled him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he believed only the boy was excited for capturing a hummar, before realizing that the boy shouted \"whatever bit me!
Something bit me!\"
\"Heile's collar bone was torn off,\" Hammel said he observed when he reached the boy.
\"I screamed that everyone had to get out of the water: There's a shark in the water!\" Hammel added.
The boy was taken by air ambulance and taken to Rady Hospital for children in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
It is uncertain what kind of shark it was that regretted the boy.
Bathroom guard Captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but that shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles added that the boy suffered serious injuries to the upper body.
Authorities closed access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that there are more than 135 different species of shark in the area, but most are not believed to be dangerous.
The Sainsbury store chain’s stakes on beauty products
The British chain of stores Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenham's beauty products and offer big magazine services in the store.
As part of an investment in Britain's beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow while fashion and interiorsala goes down, Sainsbury's should test out their beauty products in 11 stores next year, and several stores if it becomes a success.
The investment in beauty products comes at a time when the shelves that used to be filled with TVs, microwaves and interiors are now empty.
Sainbury's said they should double the number of beauty products to 3,000 products and offer the trademarks Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
They should give marked L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand such as in the Boots stores.
The store should also relaunch its own makeup series Boutique and make most of the products vegan, attracting several young customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test the sale of its perfumes in two of the Sainsbury's stores. The first opened in Croydon, London, last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online action and a shift towards buying small amounts of food every day from local small stores, means that large shopping chains need to find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, managing leader of Sainsbury's, has commented that the stores will look more and more like supermarkets, while the store chains are trying to fight the low cost stores Aldi and Lidl with several services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has joined the interior chain Argos in hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat stores, since they purchased both chains two years ago. Sainsbury's claims that this has increased the grocery store and so defended the acquisition.
The store chain's previous attempt to renew the beauty and pharmacy departments was not a success.
Sainsbury's collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but this ended when the parties did not agree on how to share the profit from the pharmacy in the stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold the Celesio pharmacy chain, which had 281 pharmacies and owned the Lloyds pharmacy chain, £125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still has a role to play and should offer an extended luxury series of skin products, including marked La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: \"We have changed how the beauty shelves will look and be experienced to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also added colleagues with special skills to offer beauty services.
Our brands are designed so that they fit all needs, while the attractive environment and the practical locations mean that we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of acting.\"
Peter Jones \"running\" after Holly Willoghby resigns from deal worth £11 million
The star of the TV program Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is \"racing\" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an agreement with his lifestyle brand worth £11 million to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time to promote their interior and worship mark Truly.
The couple's collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host of this Morning program, 37, made news known on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the star from Dragons Den, Peter Jones, in the middle of the development of their new collaboration on a lifestyle brand to focus on his own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was \"rapid\" when the golden Holly confessed during a strained meeting on Tuesday at Jones's business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly's new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - means that she no longer has time to collaborate on interior and worshipfully.
The collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to make known that she should not work with Truly, while Jones escaped Britain to calm down in one of her holiday homes.
A source said: \"Truly was certainly at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term plan for the future, and would last for many decades.
Her decision to withdraw has surprised everyone involved.
No one believed their own ears on Tuesday, Truly was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse in Marlow filled with goods ready for sale.\"
Experts believe that the decision of This Morning host, one of the richest stars in the UK, can cost the company millions because of fierce investments in products, from putter to candle to clothing and interior, and can cause delays with the launch.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, whose mother is three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, has been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created the brand Truly along with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman of the board in March.
Para vacations together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin hosting ITV's program I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, \"We don't comment on his business.\"
Tough conversations \"and then we fall in love\"
He joked about the criticism he was going to get from the media to make a comment some people could experience as \"uppresidentic\" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said with his nonsense voice as \"newsreader\".
\"I haven't given up anything.\"
He commented that Kim is interested in a new meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step towards the disarmament of the North Korea nuclear weapons program.
However, negotiations on the nuclear weapons program have halted.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the top diplomat from North Korea said Ri Yong Ho to the world leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not received a \"equivalent response\" from the United States on North Korea's early disarmament.
Instead, he added, continue the United States with sanctions to push North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
\"It's going great between us and North Korea,\" he said.
\"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship.\"
He added that his work to improve relationships with Kim has brought positive results - the end of rocket testing, help in the release of hostages and the return of the hires of U.S. soldiers.
He defended his unusual approach to relationships with Kim.
\"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in, we had around 200 people standing right there,\" Trump said pointing to the group standing before him.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia destroy island and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign aid organizations were told that there was no need for them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's residents had to flee, no one declared national emergency status, which is necessary to obtain international emergency assistance.
\"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very clear that they do not want international help, so it is a little challenging,\" said Sumbung.
While the Redd Kids put together a team to travel to Palu, it is still not certain if added with foreign passports are allowed to work in the field.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Crisis Agency in Indonesia, said authorities are considering the situation in Palu to see if international organizations are allowed to offer naudhelp.
Although Indonesia is exposed to earthquakes often, the country is not particularly prepared for the forces of nature.
In the Aceh area, they have built shelters for tsunamis, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
Despite warnings against tsunamis in Palu, there was no alarm, which most likely led to more victims.
Traveling between the Indonesian islands is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to treat those who were injured in the earthquake is now en route to Palu, but it will spend at least three days reaching the location of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on improving infrastructure in Indonesia during the presidential election, and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railways.
However, lack of funding has made it difficult for the administration of President Joko, and next year there are elections again.
President Joko is also pressured when it comes to sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have welcomed his conservative beliefs.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets and used macheter, arrow and arc, and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge saves Liverpool vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge won the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal while the position was 1-0.
He pushed the ball to the left before kicking him up and towards the goal.
The attempt sailed high above the penalty field and fauk towards the right upper corner of the target.
Finally, the ball falls over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and into goal.
\"I just tried to get into that position to take the ball, and I knew that players like Shaq are trying to get as far as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible,\" said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
\"I saw Kante come and lose the ball once without thinking about it, and then I shot the ball.\"
Chelsea rented 1-0 after the break after the scoring in the 25th minute of the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Before the goal, Hazard gave the ball to Mateo Kovacic before throwing off the scene near the midfield and into the Liverpool Peninsula.
Kovacic quickly took the ball on the midfield.
Then he shot it in a pleasant way and hired Hazard into the penalty field.
Hazard ran faster than Liverpool's defense and score with his left foot just past the keeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at 15 p.m. on Wednesday in Stadio San Paolo, Naples, Italy.

Number of victims in Indonesia tsunami increases to 832
The number of victims in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, reported the emergency agency in the country early Sunday.
Many people became trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed in the earthquake, such as on Friday and had a magnitude of 7.5 followed by 6 metres high waves, reported the spokesman for the emergency agency, Sutpo Purwo Nugroho, in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 38,000 residents, is now covered with collapsed buildings.
British police arrest man, 32, suspected of murder after woman became stabbed to death
A murder investigation has begun after a woman was found killed in Birkenhead, Merseyside today early.
The 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 p.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, while a 32-year-old man is arrested, suspected of murder.
Police have requested tips on the incident from local residents.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: \"The investigation is still in an early phase, but I ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I also urge everyone, including taxi drivers, who can capture something on dashboard cameras, to contact us in case they have important information.\"
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman found is from Birkenhead, and that she was found in a home.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have come to the area to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and police have stated that they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get into his own apartment, but has been told by the police that no one is allowed to enter or out of the building.
He did not know what to say when he found out what had happened.
The Belgians have been told that they are not allowed to enter their apartments in many hours.
Someone heard a police officer say to a man that the whole area is a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene crying.
She says again and again \"it's so horrible\".
At 14 a.m., two police cars could be seen within the police band and another police car outside the band.
A crowd of policemen stood within the police band and observed a block of apartments.
If someone has information, they can send DM to @MerPollCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling +44 (0) 800 555 111 with the reference \"log 247 from September 30\".
Parliamentary statue of Cromwell is the last victim of the \"rewriting of history\"
The removal of the statue would be karma for Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious objects in England that his Puritan followers did during the 17th century Civil War.
But the Cromwell League described Crick's proposal to remove the statue as \"noise\" and \"an attempt to write about history.\"
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell League, said: \"It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues, that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would become a goal.
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, for centuries before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent representation of Cromwell is evidence of public opinions in the 19th century, and is part of historiography of a figure that many still thought it is worth celebrating.\"
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: \"Cromwell was in the 19th century, and is still today, regarded as a defender of parliament against external pressure, and in his case, of course, it was against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or one, is still a discussion topic in historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual that we know represented one side of that distinction.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering.\"
Killing and killing Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, with the surname Yuan, was found dead, with cut arteries and covered with blood, near a pig'sebing on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to give pigs vaccines on a farm on 30 May, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently travelled with his cousin from neighboring province Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, he found his cousin dead, discovering that the gate of one of the pigs was open.
He said that in the bin there was a large male pig with blood around the mouth.
The autopsy showed that a 250 kilo heavy pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
\"The legs of my cousin were bloody and destroyed,\" said the cousin, named Wu, to Guiyang Evening News.
Monitoring cameras show that Yuan came to the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent him from attacking others, while police gathered evidence of the scene.
Yuan's family now negotiates compensation with the market leader.
Although rare, such attacks from pigs have occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, giving the man serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kilo heavy pig held a Welsh farmer trapped between him and a tractor, until his wife scared the pig away.
After a farmer in Oregon became eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive to normal but that the taste of blood can trigger the animals.
\"They just want to play.
They like to bite a little, they're curious... they won't hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them,\" he said.
Rests of Hurricane Rosa Brings Rain to the Southwestern United States
As predicted in the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker over the cool waters along the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will carry pestal rains to north Mexico and south-west U.S. in the next few days.
Rosa had wind power up to 136 km/h and was a hurricane of Category 1 until 05:00 in the eastern time zone of the United States on Sunday, and the Hurricane Center was 620 kilometres southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, there is a low pressure across the Pacific Ocean moving east towards the west coast of the United States. Rosa comes nearer the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical humidity north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will react with low pressure and cause thick rain in the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 centimeters of rain can create dangerous embarrassments and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will lead to rain of between 5 and 7 centimeters per hour in some parts of the south-west United States, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimetres of rain is expected in parts of the south-west U.S.; especially over large parts of Arizona.
Dangerous embarrassments can occur due to scattered terrain and tropical rain.
It was warned against tours in the desert on foot due to the danger of tropical rain.
Rain can turn climbs into embarrassing rivers and lightning and thunderstorms will bring strong winds and dust.
The coming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the coast of southern California.
Total rainfall amounts of over 1 centimeter is possible, which can create small embarrassing and smooth roads.
This will be the first rain town for the season of the region.
Spreaded tropical rains will start in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain increases late Monday and Tuesday.
The Four Corners region can wait a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October can witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic becomes colder, but tropical strokes will still be quite warm.
Sometimes this results in dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
There is almost 20 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, late summer heat will try to build up and spread again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm start on October, with 25 degrees and up from the southern part of the large plains to parts of the northeast United States.
New York City can reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
The long-term warning indicates that there are high chances of above the average temperatures in the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people looked at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the U.S. Supreme Court and woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different television channels.
At the same time, the political discussion around the case continued, interrupted by the regular TV programmes of various broadcasting companies to reveal the latest news on Friday: a unity reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that during the next week the FBI will investigate the charges.
Ford told the Supreme Court Committee that she is 100 percent sure Kavanaugh felt sorry for her when he was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, during a sensitive hearing, that he is 100 percent sure it did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw the harvest on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company reached this number by finding the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC.
The numbers were not clear from other channels showing the corner, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has trouble counting viewers looking at from the office.
To put this into perspective, there are a similar number of viewers looking at an American football final or Oscar distribution.
Fox News' hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the channel was also the one with the most viewers during the day with 5.69 million viewers, says Nielsen.
ABC was second place 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.44 million, MSNBC 2.99 million and CNN 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
People are still interested after hearing.
Flake was in focus during the drama on Friday.
After Flake, who is a moderate Republican, declared that he is on Kavanaugh's side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while protesters shouted for him on his way to a hearing with a judge committee on Friday.
He stood and looked at the ground for several minutes while protesters yelled at him on CNN live.
\"I'm standing right here in front of you,\" said a woman.
\"Do you trust him to tell the truth to our country?\"
Some said to him, \"You have power, while so many women are powerless.\"
Flake said his office has stated, and before entering the elevator, he said he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
Broadcasting agencies showed the hearing on television when the judge committee was to vote for or against the nomination of Kavanaugh to full Senate and further voting.
But Flake said he could only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against Kavanaugh in the next week, which Democrats have also requested.
Flake was partly overturned after talking to his friend, Democrat, and Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision proved to have power, because it became clear that Republicans could not vote for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May blames critics for \"playing politics\" in terms of Brexit
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, blames critics for her plans to leave the EU to \"play politics\" with the future of Britain without regard to national interests, in an interview with the newspaper The Sunday Times.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to attend the Conservative Party's conference on September 29, 2018.
Next to the interview with May on the front of the Sunday Times stands an interview with former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, where he goes to take action on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and says that the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other's fees is \"fully absurd.\"
Wayde Sims shooting in the United States: Police arrest suspected Dyteon Simpson for Sims shooting
Police have arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), was killed.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for deliberate murder, the police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
An official video shows the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to a report from the WAFB channel, which is related to CBS.
After the crowd with Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
Simpson's bail was set at $350,000, reports the local newspaper The Advocate.
The Coronane of East Baton Rouge published an early autopsy report on Friday showing that the cause of death was a shot in the head entering the neck.
The Baton Rouge police thank the Louisiana state police special forces, state police's crimelab, police at Southern University and local residents to help them find Simpson.
The athletic director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the local police for being \"vigilant in the achievement of justice.\"
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 metre high basketball player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 setbacks per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team is \"smoothless\" after Wayde was killed.
\"This is something we're always afraid of,\" Wade said.
Volkan spouts ash over Mexico City
The ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Crisis Prevention calls on Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after the activity increased in the crater and the center recorded 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center had observed several rumblings and quakes.
Social media images show thin layers of ash on cars in different neighborhoods of Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, since an earthquake of 7.1 hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as \"Don Goyo\" and has been active since 1994.
Police noise along with Catalan separatists within the anniversary of the voice of independence
Six protestors were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters for self-reported noises along with police forces, and thousands of other protesters protested independence one year after the voice of any separation from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces while throwing eggs and powder varnish that created dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
The compound also erupted later in the day, and police used batons to prevent escalation.
For several hours, the separatists shouted \"Don't forget, don't forgive\" while protesters against self-cooling shouted, \"Long live Spain.\"
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were treated for small injuries after the protests.
The atmosphere is still pressured in the region and many will still have independence one year after the 1st October rally, which was called illegal by Madrid, but which was celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
Most voters voiced for independence, but it was also low violence among those who were against the self-sustaining and boycott the voice.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent the voice and select compounding occurred in the region.
Groups who were too self-employed slept in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
However, the demonstration went off the stack, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protests along with his wife, said that he no longer has hope of independence in Catalonia.
\"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy to be able to voice for independence, but now we're stuck again,\" he said.
Although they won the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties who are too independent are struggling to hold power this year, while many of their leaders are in exile or arrest while waiting for their trial for their role in the organization of the people's voice and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protests in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict was headed up by police officers on both sides.
\"The tension increases more and more,\" he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been part of ongoing trials since last year, declared that he will run for election in the European Parliament next year.
\"To run as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the oppression we have experienced from the Spanish state,\" he said.
Londonderry, Northern Ireland: Men arrested to crash car into house intentionally
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 years have been arrested after crashing into a house intentionally several times in Londonderry, Northern Ireland.

Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said that the car caused damage to the entrance gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may have been used to shoot at the car.
Menga shot gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secure says
Excited Livingston surprises Rangers and Steven Gerrard experiencing his second say after 18 games training for the Ibrox club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to make the difference while Gary Holt's side evened with Hibernian in others.
Gerrard's side has no missing wins in the Scottish Premier League this season, and will play against Hearts, which they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has six consecutive wins, and head coach Holt has still not lost since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston loses chances of the away team
Holt's team should have hired long before they score, creating several problems for the Rangers with their direct playing.
Scott Robinson broke through, but had low efforts towards goals, causing Alan Lithgow to work hard after meeting Craig Halkett's heading over the goal.
The home team was happy to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause trouble for the away team.
And that's how the decisive goal became scora.
Rangers agreed to a free kick and Livingston created an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson headed towards Menga, which took a touch and score from the middle of the penalty field.
Before then, Rangers dominated the ball, but saw that the home defense was solid and keeper Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continues into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save a goal.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but was stopped by Rangers' keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow flicked wide after the ball was returned from Livingston.
Passports were sent back and forth in the Livingston penalty field, while two penalties - after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one by hand - were waved away.
'Fenomenal' from Livingston analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont, Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal struggle and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Each player played fantastically and still impresses on the curve upwards.
Their playing and playing style has hardly changed since they returned to the top class, but much of the thanks for it goes to Holt for the way he has shocked the team since he became a coach.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense, organizing a military-level defense, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worral throughout the game.
The Rangers, in contrast, were not motivated.
However, even as good as they have been under Gerrard, they were not good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, and cut only the home half once, which should make Rangers realize they won't get up anymore.
Erdogan Gets Mixed Welcome to Cologne
The leaders of Turkey and Germany smiled under blue sky when they met to eat breakfast on Saturday, September 29, Berlin.
It is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - as it is hoped to repair relations between the two NATO countries.
The countries have been indifferent in terms of human rights, press freedom and Turkey's role in the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a large, new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of over 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque due to \"security causes,\" but many of Erdogan's supporters met up to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan - many of the Kurdish - also met up to condemn Erdogan's policies and the German state's decision to wish him welcome in the country.
The duelling Protestants reflected the distinction between German Turks, who view Erdogan as a hero, and others, who view him as an autocrat.

Long Lartin Prison in England: Six guards injured in rebellion
Six prison guards have been injured in a riot in a men's high-security prison, the prison office of England says.
The ongoing disorder broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 local time on Sunday.
Special \"Tornado\" forces have been obtained to calm down the rebellion, involving eight prisoners in a separate part of the prison.
The guards have been treated for minor injuries in the face.
A prison spokesman said: \"Specially trained guards should calm down the ongoing riot in HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are ready that those responsible will be reported to the police and may have to sit in prison anymore.\"
It sits more than 500 people in HMP Long Lartin, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the United Kingdom.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated for injuries, after a prisoner went to action.
And in October last year, special forces had to come to the prison to calm down a serious revolt, where prisoners threw billiard bullets on the guards.
Hurricane Rosa believes Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with embarrassment (for the benefit of drought area)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but it is just such a weather phenomenon that is heading towards Arizona early next week, in the remains of Hurricane Rosa pull south-west over the desert and create fear of embarrassment.
The national weather service has issued warnings against embarrassment on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and south and east Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and can give rain already late Monday.
The national weather service in Phoenix twitra that only \"ten tropical cyclones have had tropical storm or low pressure status within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that reached 60 kilometres within the Arizona border.\"
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center report between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
It can count between 2 and 5 centimeters in other areas of the southwest desert, including central parts of Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, with isolated total amounts up to 10 centimeters.
For the areas outside of embarrassing risk, the rain from Rosa can be a blessing in the dry.
Although embarrassing is a serious concern, this likely will count the beneficial areas of the Southwest U.S. that are exposed to drought.
According to drought monitors in the United States, there is extreme drought in over 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second highest drought category, reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is going to move across the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
With winds of over 135 kilometers per hour, Rosa is on Sunday morning 619 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm meets colder water in the Pacific Ocean and thus calms down.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storm forces, Monday afternoon or evening.
It's going to count a lot in parts of Mexico, which can increase the risk of embarrassment.
\"Regn between 7 and 15 centimeters is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 centimeters,\" reported weather.com.
Rosa will pull north along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will pull further up through Arizona and into South Utah Tuesday evening.
\"The greatest danger of Rosa or the remains of this, is much rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest Desert,\" said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to create life-threatening embarrassments in desert areas and landslides in mountainous areas.

Trump says Kavanaugh \"suffered\" under where \"bad and angry\" Democrats were against him
\"A voice for judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the merciless and unreasonable tactics of the Democrats,\" Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has \"suffered\" under how \"bad and angry\" Democrats were through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying emotionally for the charge of Christine Blasey Ford that he assaulted her sexually several decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about her charges during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the \"American people saw how brilliant and brave\" Kavanaugh was that day.
\"A voice to Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to one of the most skilled lawyers of our time, a lawyer with flawless service in the public,\" he said to a lot of followers in West Virginia.
The president also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke of how important it is for the Republicans to voice in the mid-choices of the United States.
\"Five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really running,\" he said.
\"That's why I travel around to fight for good candidates.\"
Trump argued that Democrats are looking to \"stand up and block.\"
The first important vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place last Friday, a Republican representative told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of killed increases
At least 384 people are killed, many of them taken by huge waves on beaches, while a powerful earthquake and a tsunami framed the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, reported authorities on Sunday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to take part in a festival on the beach of the town of Palu on Friday when the waves, which were six meters high, struck the beach at sunset, taking many people while destroying everything they came across.
The tsunami came after an earthquake with magnitude of 7.5.
\"When the warning of the tsunami came yesterday, there were still people on the beach who didn't leave immediately and so they became victims,\" said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for the Indonesia GDPB crisis relief agency, in Jakarta.
\"As if the tsunami wasn't enough in itself, he brought cars, wooden trunks, houses; he framed everything on land,\" Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had travelled over open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climbed into trees to avoid the tsunami and survived that way.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos from the air published by the emergency agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershock continue to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake could be marked in the surrounding area, which has a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's agency for testing and testing technology (BPPT) stated that the energy from the earthquake on Friday, was about 200 times stronger than the energy from the nuclear bomb over Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geography of the city, located on the end of a long, narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho decrive the damage as \"wide\" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the dead have been found during the remains of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and that 29 are still missing.
Nugroho said that the number of fatalities and the size of the destructions can be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
\"We haven't heard anything from Donggala, communication is cut,\" Nugroho said.
\"More than 300,000 people live there,\" stated the Red Cross, adding that their added and volunteers are on their way to the hit areas.
\"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,\" said the Red Cross.
The crisis agency became on Saturday criticized for not informing that a tsunami had slowed Palu, although authorities said waves came within the time notified.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building who desperately cries to humans down the streets to warn them of the upcoming wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hits the coast, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the video with the first.
The quake and tsunami caused power failure and cut communication around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate the naudhelp.
The military has started the process of submitting cargo aircraft with naud help from Jakarta and other cities, reports authorities, but the refugees still need food and have other basic needs.
The city's airfields were reopened to receive emergency aid, but will continue to be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of fatalities in Indonesia exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
The added in the World Vision from Donggla has arrived safely to Palu city, and has set up tents in the back yard of its office. On the way to the city passed the totally destroyed areas, Doseba said.
\"They told me they saw many destroyed houses,\" he said.
It's very bad.
While naudhelp organizations start work on helping those who were hit by the tsunami, some have complained that foreign naudhelp workers with expertise in crisis management have been denied entry to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign aid organizations and their added work cannot start until Indonesia has declared that the area is a national crisis zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
\"It's a crisis at provincial level,\" said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
\"When the state says \"OK, this is a national crisis,\" we can open to international naudhelp, but they have not yet updated the status.\"
It is evening again in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, and friends and family of those who are still missing still hope for a miracle, but know that such natural disasters do not end well.
On Saturday, a small boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was rescued from the remains of a collapsed building, where she had doctors trapped alongside her dead mother for two days.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglids from the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
A man called Mandaki said that any of those trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
\"As one with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear on,\" he said.
Gendon told that he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Paraglids of Palu, who had taken part in the local beach festival, after hearing that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages only showed a gray chin, instead of two blue chins.
\"I think that means that the messages did not come out,\" he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 from minibank in Newport, Levee, United States
On Friday, thieves stole $26,750 from a worker in the company Brink's in what he was about to fill up a minibank in Newport, Levee, United States, following a press release from Newport police.
The worker had just exhausted a minibank in the entertainment area and was about to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy stated in the press release.
While the worker was busy, \"blow a man up behind the worker\" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses observed several suspects while fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but police could not determine the number of people involved in the robbery.
If someone has information about who was involved, they should call the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapparen renames Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes its name - to Ye.
He declared the name change on Twitter on Saturday, and wrote: \"The creation formerly known as Kanye West.\"
West, 41, has had Ye as a nickname for a while, using the name as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The name change came right before performing on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to drop his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show after she canceled because of \"emotional causes,\" the host said.
In addition to being a shortening of his current artist name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
\"I think the word \"ye\" is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means \"you,\" West said earlier this year discussing the album title with the Big Boy radio host.
\"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
The name has changed from Kanye, meaning the only one, to only Ye - to reflect the good we do, the bad we do, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects on who we are.\"
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West before, has also changed the writing style of the name with and without a hyphen and capital letters.
Future President of Mexico promises not to send the military against civilians
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to send military forces against civilians. The country will soon mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody treatment of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he \"will never use the military to suppress the Mexican people.\"
On October 2, 1968, the military shot at peaceful protesters and killed about 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to students and opening more free universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of access to education have caused youths to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double investment in artificial intelligence
Since China is working more actively with artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investments in research on the subject, says the investor and user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the U.S. government stated about artificial intelligence, although the United States lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year, aiming to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
\"A doubling of the budget for research on artificial intelligence would be a good start, since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence,\" Lee said.
A doubling in funding can double the chances that the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence takes place in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, publishing the book \"AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order\" this month via the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the managing director (CEO) of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the largest companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with a system of artificial intelligence that defeated the highest ranked player of the game Othello, and later worked as a leader in Microsoft Research and was chairman of Google, China.
Lee recognized former technology competitions organized by the U.S. state, such as the \"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge\" and asked how time the next competition should be, so he was involved and identifying the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get support from the state, Lee said.
\"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's the big companies,\" Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired excellent students from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen the research on artificial intelligence.
\"I thought that doctoral students in artificial intelligence should get automatic retention permission,\" he said.
The Government of China published its plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National League of Natural Sciences funds students at academic institutions, not unlike the American National Science Association and other state organizations' way of distributing money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a common center of artificial intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from the industry and academia, and the White House declared the formation of a Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI (artificial intelligence) Next.
The National Science Association invests more than $100 million a year in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, no one has worked on the bill on national security and artificial intelligence in several months.
Macedonians dare to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voiced on Sunday in a referendum if they should change their name to the Republic of North Macedonia to resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, insists that the name of neighbouring North represents a claim to their territory, and has used veto to vote against membership of Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name exchange may undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott has sown doubts as to how far the referendum will reach the at least 50 percent of the population it needs to be valid.
The question at the referendum is: \"Are you for NATO and EU membership and agree in the agreement with Greece?\"
Supporters for the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the name change is worth EU and NATO membership. Macedonia is one of the countries that achieved independence after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
\"I am here today to voice for the future of this country, for the youth of Macedonia, so they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us,\" said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the voice is not binding according to the law, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have said that they will follow the result of the voice to make her decisive.
In order for the name change to take place, Parliament needs two-thirds of the conclusion.
The state election committee reported that nothing unusual had occurred by 13:00.
Only 16 percent had voted, as opposed to 34 percent in previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 of all registered voters voted.
\"I voice for my children, we belong in Europe,\" said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voters in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voiced in Strumika in the referendum in Macedonia for whether to change their name and open to join NATO and EU on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of the referendum in front of parliament in Skopje, by setting up tents and chairs.
\"We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not to change the name of our country,\" Kavadarkov said.
\"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us under the name Macedonia, we can go to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration.\"
Prime Minister Zaev has stated that membership in NATO will draw investors to Macedonia, which has over 20 percent unemployment.
\"I believe that the majority will vote for the change, by your 80% of our citizens will become a member of the EU and NATO,\" Zaev said after speaking.
He said that a \"yes\" result can be interpreted as a \"confirmation of our future.\"
A poll last Monday by Macedonia's Institute of Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters are going to take part in the referendum - which is below the required number.
Another opinion poll of the Telma TV channel in Macedonia, showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, the channel said that 70 percent would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to close, at least 50 percent must be voiced, plus one voice.
If the referendum does not close, it may harm the policy of the left-wing government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling wrecked Brighton's defense leading to 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy, as he scores for 65 minutes.
The Argentine tip welcomed a pass on the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran past three Brighton defense players and reached open orbit.
Suddenly Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender, before running past several others on the edge of the Brighton penalty field.
He got past a pass on the left and found Sterling.
The English tip used its first kick in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who spent his right foot beating Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot straight into the right end of the goal.
\"Aguero still struggles with the feet,\" City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
\"We were talking about he could play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he was scoring when he did.\"
But it was Sterling who gave the sky blue the first advantage of the Premier League game.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero welcomed the ball deep inside Brighton territory.
He beautifully kicked the ball along the left end of the path to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball while hiring Sterling towards the goal.
The sky blue tip kicked the ball into the goal just before she slipped out of the path.
City will play against Hoffmanheim in the Champions League group phase at 12:55 on Tuesday in Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will play spoilers against Rockies in American baseball
With Nationals eliminated from \"playoff content\" there was not much reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has high competitive instincts, and hopes to take the \"mound\" on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to \"playoff\" for Rockies, as a leader with one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies won at least 5-2 against Nationals Friday night, but looks forward to locking the first division title.
\"Even if we're not playing for anything, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team most likely playing at the highest level so far this year.
Who doesn't want to play with such relationships?\"
It is still uncertain who will start in the Nationals on Sunday, but it may happen Scherzer is going to \"pitche\".
Scherzer, who then starts for the 34th time, threw a \"bullpen session\" on Thursday and should \"pitche\" normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, coming from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 \"strikeouts\" in 220 2/3 \"innings\" this season.
Trump collects voters in West Virginia
The president was obscurely referring to his first election for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about how important it was for the Republicans to vote in the mid-term elections in the United States.
\"All we've done so far is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm running around everywhere to fight for the best candidates,\" he said.
Trump continued, \"You can see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see that happening right now.
And they are convinced that they will certainly take back the power, you see how horrible they are, how nasty they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them.\"
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to \"oppose and block.\"
\"And you can see it based on the last four days,\" he said, calling the Democrats \"sine and bad and nasty and dishonest.\"
He referred to Senator and Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who caused his audience to bow.
\"Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who leaked documents?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I expect - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've seen.\"
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They are intolerant to those who say what they mean
When the Momentum activists of my local party voiced to censor me, it was not surprising.
I am the last in a series of Labour MPs that have been told that I am not welcome - just to say what I mean.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she protested anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for being incompatible with Jeremy Corbyn.
In terms of the importance of running responsible economy, national security, Europe, and other similar themes that Jeremy ironically was incompatible with former leaders about.
In the call for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it said, \"we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive.\"
In my last eight years as Labour MP, Friday's meeting has been just like that.
Unfortunately, today's meeting was not so, and the promise of \"snailer\" policy is long-forgotten, if at all it was followed.
It has become more and more apparent that different views are not tolerated in Labour, and that every opinion is judged by the leaders of the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became a party leader, when colleagues I used to be politically agreeable with suddenly expected me to re-order and agree on matters I would never agree with - whether it was then about national security or the internal market in the EU.
When I speak publicly, it doesn't matter what I say, I always get yelled at social media and people want me to go off while they criticize center politics and say I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who get gender-discriminatory and racist shikas aimed at themselves every day, and who are still professional and do not resign.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time period, is how normalized it has become to harass police officers.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should become more tolerant.
In reality, we are no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone. For each mistrust proposal and for every change in party rules, the party becomes narrower and narrower.
I have received many advice in the past two years from people who have said I have to take it easy and not be so loud, so maybe people will \"like me better.\"
But that's not why I chose to join politics.
When I joined Labour, when I was still attending the school 32 years ago, it was because I was angry at Thatcher and how the government failed the country. My classroom was falling together, so I would have better public services for those who need them the most - if it was then as a municipal councillor or government minister.
I have never hidden my political opinions, nor in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East may have been in doubt about what I stand for and which of the current leaders I am not agreeing with.
To those who voted for the proposal on Friday, I can only say that when the country crashes against a Brexit that wants to harm private, local agencies and public services, I don't understand why people care about wasting energy asking questions about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in fact, not the only message I've directed to Nottingham Momentum, but to the voters in the constituencies, whether they're Labour voters or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise no one can get me to resign or change my policy and prevent me from serving you in the way I think is best for you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr goes to top in Scottish rugby
Two late \"tries\" may have changed the result slightly, but there is no doubt that Ayr intended to win in this very entertaining Tennent's Premiership game today.
They now stand on top of the pallet as the only invincible made of a total of ten.
It was their sovereign defense and ability to take chances that gave their home team and coach, Peter Murchie, good reason to be satisfied.
\"We've been tested in recent games, and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy,\" he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: \"Ayr fades praise, they were better than us to take chances.\"
Grant Anderson had a \"try\" for 14 minutes, where Frazier Climo tried a \"conversion,\" which put Ayr in front, but a yellow card from Scotland captain Rory Hughes from Warriors let Melrose gather, and Jason Baggot took a \"unconverted try.\"
Climo received a penalty just before the break, he scora and \"converted\" a \"solo try\" to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started second half well and Patrick Anderson's \"try,\" which became \"converted\" by Baggot, reduced the slinging Monnet by five points.
There was a long break when Ruaridh Knott became seriously damaged and put on stretch, and from the restart fauk Ayr forward through a \"try\" from Stafford McDowall, such as Climo \"converted.\"
The acting captain of Ayr, Blair MacPherson, received a yellow card, and again Melrose tried a \"unconverted Bruce Colvine try,\" at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to deal with the Climo without the ball from the penalty lineup, Scout MacPherson a \"try.\"
Climo \"converted\" again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's \"box kick\" and sent the \"flanker\" Gregor Henry away from his home team's fifth \"try.\"
The star of the Scottish series, Still Game, starts new career in the restaurant industry
The Scottish Still Game star, Ford Kieran, seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry, after it was discovered that he is the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays in conjunction with partner Greg Hemhill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan plans life after Craiglang.
According to official lists, he is the director of Akvarkmorn Limited.
The actor will not comment on the case, but a source from the Scottish Sun newspaper has hinted that Kiernan would involve himself in the \"progressive restaurant industry\" in Glasgow.
\"Havet is ours\": Bolivia hopes the court will open water roads to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flag with sea blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are covered with the motto: \"The sea is ours. We're right.
And the duty to return to it.\"
In landlocked Bolivia, the people can still remember a coastline the country lost to Chile, in a bloody conflict about resources in the 19th century. They yearn to sail in the Pacific again.
These hopes may be stronger than in many decades while Bolivia waits for the verdict of the International Court of Justice to arrive on October 1, after five years of re-election.
\"Bolivia has driven, insanity and is alone, and expects of course a positive result,\" said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are going to look at the ruling from the International Court, hoping that the Court of The Hague supports Bolivia's demands, and that Chile - after decades of negotiations - provides Bolivia with a independent exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia - who strives to be re-elected next year - has good reason to hope for a positive result.
\"Now we will be returning to the Pacific,\" he promised in late August.
However, some analysts do not believe the court is going to allow Bolivia access to the sea - and that little would have changed even if they were allowed access.
The Netherlands-based UN court has no power to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia, and has spurred that they will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
That the ruling from the court comes just six months after the last negotiations, indicates that the case \"was not complicated,\" said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
For the past four years, far from promoting Bolivia's case, they have done the opposite.
\"The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration,\" Zárate said.
Morales, with his contentious rhetoric, has killed what was that of Chile's goodwill, Zárate thought.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the issue after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have \"an extraordinary opportunity to open new relationships with Chile\" and a chance to \"set lines at 139 years of ineligibleness and rather benefit both of them,\" he said.
Calzadilla also rejected that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used this maritime issue to win votes.
\"Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific,\" he added.
\"The judgment is a possibility to see what we need to do to forget the past.\"
North Korea says they will not abolish nuclear weapons if they cannot trust the United States
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation cannot be the first to abolish, if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to follow up on the boost they gave during the Singapore meeting between the American and North Korean leaders.
Ri's comments come at a time when the United States' Foreign Minister, Mike Pomepo, seems to want to restart his locked nuclear diplomat, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the United States has a false hope that North Korea will submit if the United States continues with sanctions and opposes any declaration of the end of the Korean War.
Washington refuses to agree to any declaration of the end of the war, without Pyongyang abolishing first.
Both Kim and the U.S. President, Donald Trump, will hold a new meeting.
However, many are critical that Pyongyang is serious in terms of the destruction and that the country most likely sees its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows that massive main garment is the last fashion on the way to a shopping street near you
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, then you don't need to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a number of large and special main garments in their SS19 collection. The main garment surprised the public during the Paris fashion week.
Highly impractical hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creations right on the catwalk.
The most magnificent garment was a lavish, beige Valentino hat with a feather-like, at the brim covering the models' heads.
It also found other oversized additions during the fashion show, including a jeweled watermelon, a wizard hat, and even an pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of bizarre masks - just in time before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips sewn together and resembled more on Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looked like a melted ice in biscuits.
If you like this huge dramatic fashion, you can only slide.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hats come for sale in a shopping street near you.
The oversized hats come right after \"La Bomba\", the straw hat with the 60 centimetre wide breasts that have been seen on celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratakowski.
The cult brand behind the highest impractical hat, which was everywhere on social media, has now sent a new creation out on the catwalk - a straw beach bag of the same size as the bikini-clad model carrying her.
The beach bag, with the color of burnt orange and fringes topped with a white leather handle, was the most conspicuous part of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection during the fashion week of Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: \"I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the fashion stores next summer - the designer has made such a big impression that I doubt that it is possible to ignore the demand for oversized worship.\"
John Edward: Global Citizens Need Language Knowledge
Private schools in Scotland are known to lie at high academic level, and this continues in 2018 with excellent exam results, which are only enhanced by individual and common success in sports, arts, music and other social measures.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), work to offer the best services to students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, career paths and the role of global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are popular electoral skills in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: \"If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, the message goes to his heart.\"
This is an important reminder that we cannot just lean in English when we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries.
By looking at the exam results from this year, we can see that language is at the top of the league tables with the highest standing grades for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who took French language received A.
The data, collected from SCIS' 74 member schools, shows that 72 percent of students received A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who took German, 69 percent of those who took French, and 63% of those who took Spanish also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support fromman language as vital properties, which children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Languages such as electives are viewed as equivalent to the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering studies and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the British selection for addition and properties in 2014 showed that 17 percent of employers struggled to fill positions due to lack of language skills of the applicants.
Therefore, language in the school is more and more important to prepare the youth of the working life.
With several job opportunities for linguistics, these properties are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what kind of career a youth chooses, if they have learned a second language, they have a proper benefit in the future with such a property.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person benefits in a competitive world.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adult British in 2013, 75% could not speak any other language than English well enough to hold a conversation walking, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language training for our children.
Knowing more languages, especially the languages used in developing countries, can give children a better chance to find good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, each school is different in terms of which language they teach.
Many schools focus on the classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are classified as important in Britain when we look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a lot of languages to choose from in independent schools, and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated and want to create a learning environment that will prepare children and provide the properties they need to close, no matter what future brings.
It cannot be denied that in this global, business-oriented environment, language is vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be called \"International Communication Properties.\"
Independent schools will continue to offer this election, offering diversity and high competence for Scotland's young.
Il faut been le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools
LeBron debuts in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is soon facing fans who look forward to seeing LeBron James debut on the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the preseason game on Sunday, against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how long to play has not been decided yet.
\"It's going to be more than one minute and less than 49,\" Walton announced on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James will most likely play a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' schedule for the preseason.
\"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to get me ready,\" he said.
Trumps West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump begins a whirlwind of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five planned stops the coming week, including stops in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote pending to choose to fill the High Court's vacant position, Trump aims to build up support for upcoming midway elections since Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when voting is to be given in November.
What time is Trump going to be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you see it online?
Trump's collection in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely address this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense over allegations of sexual abuse, with an expected affirmative voice from the Senate waiting for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the primary goal of this Cave of Collections is to help the Republicans meet the November elections and get some momentum (driving force).
So President Trump's campaign says that these five collections next week are aimed at \"opposing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives\", according to Reuters.
\"Control of Congress is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the busy campaign season,\" a Trump campaign spokesman refuses to be informed to Reuters.
Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening collection can support from \"Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from the Pittsburgh media\", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is requested in the polls.
\"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come and try to give him a boost in the polls,\" said Simon Haeder, a political researcher at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows stomach for fighting to keep hope alive on the singles on Sunday
After three unilateral sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes could only be what this Ryder Cup trong.
The swinging pendulum of moments is a fully invented sporting assault, but one that players really believe in, and never more than on competitions like these.
So where would they say that moment is now?
\"They had a six-point lead, and now there are four, so we take it as a small moment, I guess,\" said Jordan Spieth as he walked off for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points leading with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, know that they have some wind in their seals, and they have much to be encouraged by, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each has three points from four.
Spieth has been fatal from tea to green and hires for examples.
The boydural screams of celebration became higher as his round continues, seeking an important putt to take match four all-quao.re when he and Thomas had been two down after two.
His putt who won them the game of 15, was met with a similar scream, the type that tells you that he believes that the American team is not out of this.
\"You've actually only had to dig deeply and worry about your own fight,\" Spieh said.
That's all each of these players has left now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the invincible story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's remarkable, but cute couples are four from four and can't do anything wrong.
\"Moliwood\" was the only couple to not shoot a bow on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided arceys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back Nine (the last nine holes on a course of 18 holes) on Friday morning.
That race, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this noisy, engaged audience, cementing that they are the players to be defeated on Sunday, and there would not be more popular players to seal a potential European saying when the sun goes down over Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
Talking about European honor becomes even too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did short work by Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine, rough Spanish and Swedish into a hole they never came close to climbing out.
But on Sunday no one can help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to look closely at because of the interaction between opponents, advice they give, and advice they don't give and the way that a strategy can change at a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and takes a significant lead into the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the stomach of the game that someone, especially Stateside, had doubted.
Europe takes the 10-6 lead in the Ryder Cup Final
Europe will have a healthy advantage into the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four balls and foursome games with a 10-6 lead across the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari hired the charge with two wins over a fighting Tiger Woods to take their game so far on Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side left the booth to keep the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a mistle American side tomorrow fourballs, taking the series 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in foursomes and won two games, but they could not bring in the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from the 12 single games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points while he and Molinari, called \"Molliwood\" after an interesting weekend, is only the second pair to win four points from their opening in four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they went out so great to beat an outlawed Woods and American rookie Bryson Decambaau with an even more sought after 5 and 4.
Woods, who struggled through two games on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliants, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who complained for morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe did not even get everything they wanted on a fun, blown day southwest of Paris.
Three times major wins Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference to the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a brave 2 & 1 say over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursomes when they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point base and entered the single, although as holders, Furyk's side needs only to draw to keep the trophy.
However, after being the second best for two days, it looks like a Sunday counterattack will be outside them.
North Korea says that it is not going to matter to rust down one side without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told Saturday to the United Nations that if sanctions continue, the mistrust of the United States will be greater, and that the country would in no way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual general assembly of the world government that North Korea had made \"significant measures\" to improve relations last year, for example, they have stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and do not promise to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
\"We don't get anything corresponding back from the United States, however,\" he said.
\"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first.\"
While Ri, a famous North Korean, has made several complaints over Washington's opposition to a \"phase\" approach to the abolition of nuclear weapons, where North Korea would be rewarded to take gradual steps, his contradictions proved significant by not rejecting unilateral nuclear destruction, as Pyongyang has done earlier.
Ri referred to a common statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit ever angered between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work for \"destruction of nuclear power on the Korean Peninsula\" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted conversations to facilitate tough international sanctions in North Korea.
\"The U.S. insists on \"destruction of nuclear power first\" and increases pressure with sanctions to achieve its purpose of coercion, and they even resisted \"the declaration to end peace,\" Ri said.
\"The belief that sanctions can break us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that when sanctions continue, our distrust is only greater.\"
Ri mentioned nothing about the plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. President highlighted in the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister raised three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, in the last five months and added: \"Seen the party in this petition for the destruction of nuclear weapons was South Korea, and not the United States, the downfall on the Korean Peninsula would not have stopped as it has now done\"
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the General Assembly of the F.N. that it was not possible to stop North Korean rockets against the U.S. mainland, after evil President Trump called Kim a rocketman on suicide mission.
Trump, who last year believed to \"totally destroy\" North Korea, aussed praise over Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work still had to be done and that sanctions had to remain in place until North Korea is decommissioned its nuclear weapon.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, saying, \"If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter.\"
China and Russia claim that the F.N. Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, the United States Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told the F.N.'s Security Council on Thursday that: \"The sanctions of the Security Council must still be maintained severely and without failing until we get the complete, final, verified dissolution of the nuclear weapons.\"
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to throat funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline of the F.N. General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemns him to bring \"gogster-like demands.\"
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also an atomic complex if the United States did \"similar measures.\"
He said Kim had told him that the \"similar measures\" he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalization of Washington's relationship.
Harvard students take a course in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University has this year contributed to all students getting more sleep, in an effort to fight the growing maco culture that goes out to study in caffeine all night. That is, you use caffeine to stay awake all night to study.
An academic found that students at top universities often carefree in terms of the very most basic - how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of his battle in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep shortages on learning.
\"At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, \"Why am I told this now, at adulthood?\"
She said that no one had ever told her the importance of sleeping - something that surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, rolled out for the first time this year, students explain what is important for how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the health services of the university, said that the university decided to introduce the course after students suffered seriously worse sleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves a variety of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a dormitory, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep shortages, as well as how important it is with evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know, the health effects by choosing to smoke cigarettes, added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride over the day still exists, he said and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that sleep scarcity is a growing problem.
Making sure you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said - even avoiding gaining weight, since lack of sleep puts the brain in the starving mode and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, having been a student with him last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to press for a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before starting at the prestigious institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, and also for when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of \"blue light\" coming from electronic displays and LED lighting, and which can convert the inner clock overall, causing problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga target gives Gerrard's men downturn
Rangers went on a new defeat on the outbound as Dolly Menga's post sent Steven Gerrard's unearthed page to a 1-0 loss on Livingston.
The Ibrox side was looking for to take its first victory on away track since the 4-1-triumph on St Johnstone in February, but the team of Gary Holt only caused Gerrard's second defeat on 18 games as a leader, and gave eight points, a round under Ladbroke's leader of the Premier League , Hearts.
The amount hit to seven minutes before half-time, and a Ranger setting with lack of inspiration never seemed to equalize.
While Rangers now falls to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be additional problems in stock for the Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a wound in the head, after an object apparently was thrown from the away side.
Gerrard made eight changes on the team that swept Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt , however, went with Livy 11 who took a point with a delay shot last week, and he would have been excited about the way his well-drilled outfit took the quail roof on his opponents on each shift.
Rangers might have the ball the most, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scored after just two minutes when Menga's first post sent Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder failed in his giant chance.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot far on the retreat.
Rangers took control, but it seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third round.
Alfredo Morellos decided that he would have a penalty of 20 metres mark when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson waved away the desire of the Colombian.
Rangers only managed two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly concerned with Lassana Coulibally's heads and a tamt shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the game rules, no one can deny that they only told it because of the \"shoot\".
Again, Rangers failed to handle a deep death ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit Scott Robinson's ball, which kept cool to pick out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard made the break as if he traded Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and switched caused an immediate impact when the winger made a hatch for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly raged forward to block.
However, Livingstone continues to overlook the guest team to play exactly what the game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sending long shot on long shot.
Holt's team could have increased their lead at the end, but McGregor was lucky to prevent Jacobs from doing so, until Lithgrow placed a long post from the corner mark.
Ranger's reserve, Glenn Middleton, had a new claim to punishment when he supported along with Jacobs, but again Thomson overlooked it.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger
And now a page from our \"Sunday Morning\" Almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and VI REKNAR...the day when he who would become physicist Johannes Wilhelm \"Hans\" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that ultimately led to the apparatus known as the Geiger counter.
As a scientific carrier ever since then, the Geiger counter also became a pop culture carrier, as in the 1950 film \"Bells of Coronado\" with seemingly untrue late cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: \"What in all the world is it?\"
Rogers: \"It's a Geiger counter, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms resulting from the radioactivity of the minerals.\"
Evans: \"Yes, now bubble it!\"
\"Hans\" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention asking his name, lives on.

A sample vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the adults, who learns the immune system to recognize red cells, experienced that the ovarian cancer flooded for more than 18 months.
The method involves withdrawing immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory, so that they can \"see\" a protein that is common in many cancer forms, called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: \"Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.\"
HER2 \"driven the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and \"teaching\" them how they target cancer cells, has served when treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West offered a Pro-Trump diatribe, wearing a MAGA hat, after he guested the TV show Saturday Night Live. .
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was educated in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an unlikely performance in which he praised the United States president, Donald Trump, and said he would run for election in 2020.
After taking his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great caps, he gave the Democrats a tirad and repeated his support for Trump.
\"So many times I talk to a white person, and they say, \"How could you like Trump, he's racist?\"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
The SNL started the show with a number along with comedian Matt Damon, where Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee on the charges of sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not sent, the recording to West's tirad was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to mock West with the post.
West had also complained to the public that he was having a difficult backstage due to his main garment.
\"They bullied me behind the scene.
They said, don't go out there with that hat on.
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a drowned place,\" he said, according to Washington Examinor.
West continued: \"Do you want to see the drowned space?\" says he would \"put on the superman caps, because this means you can't tell me what I'm going to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love.\"
His comments led to excavating at least twice from the public, and SNL cast members seemed embarrassingly affected, reported Variety, with a person there telling the publication: \"Heel studio was put to death.\"
West was brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, when her former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the Conservative group TPUSA, Candice Turner as tweeted: \"To one of the most brave spirits: TAKK FOR YOU TO SUPPORT THE PUBLE.\"
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West \"quite simple was just as he is and it's absolutely amazing.\"
\"But I did NOT choose to pay anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his \"art\") that I think embraces and asking out ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are, too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said he was now \"formally known as Kanye West\".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Medrappar, Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and of course the last music legend Prince, changed the name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington goes out against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's select medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actress, 31, has gone out against the macho hero's stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen often lead young boys to feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes something has gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he knows \"quite strong\" to address the problem.
\"Personally, I am informed that something has gone wrong with the masculinity.\" he said.
\"What have we taught men when they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?\"
Kit believes that TV is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to very male characters.
He continues: ‘What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and in the streets, what makes young boys feel that they have to be this particular side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.\"
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do Game of Thrones precursors or follow-up when the series ends this summer, saying he is \"completed with battlefields and horses\".
From November, Kit will play in a remake of Sam Shepards True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he is looking at the meeting with his wife Rose to be the best that came out of Game of Thrones.
\"I met my wife in this show, so that way it gave me my future family and my life further,\" he said.
Rose played Ygrite, the score of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are the framework of the country, says health add-ons.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transferred through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV rapidly spread through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusion.
However, the amount of people receiving HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health care professionals said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/HBTQ people is claimed to be widespread florets.
Due to the conservative values in the country, studies have advocated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men, will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an attempt to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to add sheet information from the GOP Senator, it explodes in 'fary lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
The United States Rep. Maxine Waers condemned on Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican U.S. Senators on Wikipedia pages to the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claims were pedaled by \"extrem-right wing\" investigations and web pages.
\"Løgner, liar and more contempty lies,\" Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information included for information home addresses and telephone numbers to Americans Sens. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel's hearing about the charges of sexual assault against Supreme Court election Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came once after the three Senators had asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was related to Waters' offices and published the information to a member of Waters staff, Hill reported.
\"This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie,\" continues Waters.
\"One of my add-ons - who has acquired his identity, personal information, and security compromised as a result of these false and false claims - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie.\"
Water's claim quickly received criticism online, including from former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
\"This denial is angry,\" wrote Fleischer.
\"This suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they don't have to be angry.
They don't have to be tough.
They do not have to question the motives of the debtor.
They must be calm and peaceful.\"
Fleischer proved to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being apparent for anger during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tries to take over Water's place in the midway election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
\"Great if it's true,\" tweeted him.
In her phrase, Waters said her office had notified \"the right government and the law enforcement units of these false claims.
\"We will make sure that the perpetrators are revealed,\" she continues, \"and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are devastating and dangerous to each and every one of my associates.\"
Johnny English hit again - spy bull of weak Rowan Atkinson
It is traditional to look for Brexit notables in all new films with a British angle, and it works for this reviving of Johnny England's action comedy spoof franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and which was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-ironic satire that replays how open-ended we are, become the new exportability of the country?
In any case, the grand, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber ankle has for the second time been allowed to renew his permission to fuck things up - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comedian for cinematists in non-English-language countries.
Of course, he is the foolish, secret agent who despite his bizarre desires to spread a little glamour has received a small bit of Clouseau, a dashboard by Mr Bean and a serving of the guy who contributes a simple tune to the Fire Trucks, the theme of the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony.
He is also originally based on the travelling and international mysterious man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two fine moments in this last JE excursion.
I love Johnny English who approached a helicopter while dressed in a medieval armor suit while the rotor blades strike his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy is on screen, but the humor feels quite weakened and strangely superfluous, especially since \"serious\" film marks such as 007 and Mission Imposible even now safely offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels as if he is aimed at children instead of adults, and to me Johnny England's noisy accident is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's replicaclause noise in the person in Bean.
The permanent current phenomenon now is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the United Kingdom's super secret web network of spies, who uncover the identities of all agents in the United Kingdom have in the area, to the dismay of the agent at work - an unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and war hero figure, who already has a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does his very best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but there is not so much in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that when every single active spy has been charged, she must bring in someone who is retired.
And that means that the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works as a teacher at a somewhat elegant establishment , but provides unofficial lessons on how to work underground: a couple of fine jokes here, since English offers a School of Rock-type academy for spying.
English is sent back to Whitehall for a naud situation-briefing and reunited with his former understanding assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moved over to a submarine driver's job, an overentusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin's ability to make things become terriblely wrong in Hernar Majesty's Secret Services are back too full in the meeting with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the charismatic technology of the billionaire's enchanting, which claims that he can solve Britain's computer problems: the unhealthy Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of farse-like wild games: disguised as waiters, put them fire at a fine French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggle aboard Volta's yacht; and English triggers pure anarchy as he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to make himself known to the interior of Volta's house.
All stops are probably pulled out to the last sequence, but as loving and unexplored as it is, there is quite a lot of child-TV all over.
Quite moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't stop thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes justice his talent?
Labour Party Labour refuses that they are working out a plan for the English to work a four-day week, but are paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party is now considering a radical plan that wants the British to work a four-day week - but gets paid for five.
According to the report, corporate executives will forward further savings made through artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees, by providing them with an extra holiday.
Then added could enjoy a three-day weekend - but still get the same salary.
Sources said the idea would \"pass\" with the economic agenda of the party and plans to increase benefits for employees.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by Trade Union Congress as a way for employees to benefit from the changed economy.
An older Labour source told The Sunday Times: A policy message is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It does not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a desire that fits into the approach the party has to balance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as superior to the party's industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its 2017 campaign.
However, the ambition is currently not approved by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: \"A four-day working week is not party politics and it is not considered by the party.\"
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's work conference to enhance his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from \"faceless directors\" and \"profits\" in wealthy businesses.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that current shareholders in water operations cannot regain their entire efforts as a Labour government could make \"request\" due to perceived abuse.
He has also confirmed plans to put employees in corporate boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds (including ownership fund) to provide 10 percent of the equity in private sector initiatives to add, which would receive annual dividends of up to £500, approximately $5,000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, tells the TV program \"60 Minutes\" if the FBI's in investigation of Kavanaugh could have them change their thoughts
The FBI investigation on complaints against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and it raises the question whether to what extent the agency found could influence some Republican Senators to draw their support.
In an interview being sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked in \"60 Minutes\" the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
\"I mean, of course,\" said Kennedy.
\"I said on my way into the hearing, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that claim came out and said, 'Have you done it?'
He was best-made, determined, outspoken.\"
Graham's voice, however, seemed seen in stone.
\"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite charge to change me,\" he said.
\"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it, \"put Graham to, and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
\"And all her names couldn't confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changed.\"
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday is New York host for the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormously impressive setting of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; ending poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocked to the Central Parks large lawn, not only to enjoy seeing Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes perform, but also to increase awareness of the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert visitors had to complete a number of tasks, or \"actions\" as volunteer work; send email to a world leader, call a phone call or other meaningful ways to help increase awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how much success has Global Citizen been with 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of paying people with a free concert a real way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called \"clicktivism\" - people feel that they make a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has registered more than 19 million \"actions\" from its supporters, participating in and pushed on a variety of goals.
It is said that these actions have contributed to world leaders being able to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group showed 390 commitments and announcements as a result of their actions, including at least $10 billion already paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funds so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a British based partnership of investors and implements who are committed to \"help children reach their full potential\"; promises to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 Tweets from global citizens.
\"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,\" - told the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking more than 5,000 actions to require Britain to become better at nutrition for mothers and children, the British government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition treatment.
In response to one of the common questions on their website, they ask, \"What makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?\"
Global citizen replied: \"It will be a long and difficult way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements lead us, we will be blessed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the actors who perform at the New York event of the year, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Fleet as a \"block\" to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington can \"if necessary\" resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, international secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
\"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to convey energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe,\" he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to tackle it.
\"The U.S. has this ability, with our Fleet, to make sure the seaways are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not go on the market,\" he said.
Zinke spoke to participants on the incident organised by Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group presenting itself as the \"voice of the energy consumer\" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are actually the same.
\"The economic solution to Iran and Russia is more or less to utilize and replace fuel,\" he said, referring to Russia as a \"one-trick pony\" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations come as the Trump administration has been on mission to increase the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
In connection with this, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, attempt to persuade Germany to withdraw from the \"inappropriate\" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump made Berlin the Moscow \"captive\".
Moscow has repeatedly underlined that the North Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's keen opposition to the project is driven only for economic reasons, and is an example of unfair competition.
\"I think we share the position that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers,\" Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude has withdrawn backlash from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policies and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
\"I have a major problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,\" said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Industrial Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will \"run hard\" to run for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would take a \"ground look\" at running for president after the mid-term election.
During a Council House meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running as a candidate.
\"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our bad government, and it includes a woman on top,\" she said according to The Hill.
\"After November 6, I will consider thoroughly to run for president.\"
Warren entered President Donald Trump during the Town Hall meeting and said that he \"conducts this country in the wrong direction.\"
\"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,\" she said.
Warren has been harsh in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court election Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, \"Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote.\"
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's own voters do not seem to believe that she should run as a candidate in 2020.
51 percent of the \"probable\" Massachusetts voters said the Senator should not run as a candidate, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Centre/ Boston Globe survey.
Thirteenty percent supported such a candidacy.
The investigation showed more support for a round of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other highly profiled democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidate, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin's PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) at Donald Trump collection
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being enlisted in September.
He was arrested and charged with an election event in his home on Monday night
\"What my own son goes through, what he goes through when he comes back, allows me to relate to other families characterized by PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers return with,\" she said to the public at a collection for Donald Trump, Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest \"the elephant of space\" and said of his son and other war veterans that \"they come back a little altered, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if the respect for what they and fellow soldiers and pilots and all the other military, has done for the country, exists\".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was accused of physical violence in the home against a woman, for disrupting a report on violence in the home and storage of a weapon while under threat, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge to new asylum policies
Eighteen states and districts of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or violence in the home.
Representatives from the 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-right short Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in Grace v. Sessions fits that the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Freedom Union) archived in August against federal politics has not been revealed.
She said her partner \"and the elected gang member sons\" abused her, but US officials denied her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the States that support Grace, describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large amount of applicants for U.S. asylum, which nations face pervasive problems with gangs and elected in the home.
The new US asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision from immigration law, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing violence in the home, to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy \"inverts many decades of government, federal, and international law.\"
\"Federal law requires all asylum cases to be judged for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an obstacle is contrary to this principle,\" said friend-of-court short.
Lawyers further claimed in the summary that policies that deny immigrants access, damage the U.S. economy, and say it is more likely that they become entrepreneurs and \"offer necessary work\".
Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing abuse and gang violence in June.
\"Asyl is available to those leaving their homeland due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political meaning,\" said Sessions in June 11 in its announcement of politics.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems - even all serious problems - that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue work in Palu while the death toll doubled in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation became increasingly serious.
\"It feels very tense,\" said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who thrashed his feverish baby son at an evacuation center in the destroyed city, Palu.
\"Each minute, ambulances come with bodies.
Clean water is hard to find.\"
Residents are observed on their way back to their broken homes, in what they are searching through water-damaged owners and trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals destroyed by the earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.5, were crowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken his back and shoulder, complained outside Palu's Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to still strong aftershock.
Tears filled his eyes while telling him that he knew the powerful earthquake shaken the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor.
\"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think,\" Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city for a wedding.
\"I heard my wife calling for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe.\"
United States ambassador blames China for \"bombing\" with \"propaganda ads\"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a 4-page advertisement in an American daily newspaper and highlighted the mutual benefits of trade with the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador accused China Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
United States President Donald Trump last referred Wednesday to China Daily's paid grants in the Des Moines register - the state of Iowa's largest salsavis - after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the U.S. Congressional elections on November 6, a fault China denies.
Trump's charge that Beijing tried to interfere in U.S. elections, marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign of Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an increasing trade war that has seen them in turn increase taxes on each other's imports.
China's retaliation tariffs early in the trade war were designed to match exporters in states such as Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former long-term Governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had injured American workers, farmers, and businesses.
\"China,\" Branstad wrote in a section of the Des Moines register of Sunday, \"dowler now the bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press.\"
\"In its dissemination of propaganda, the Chinese government uses America's beloved tradition of freedom of speech and a free press by posting a paid ad in the Des Moines register,\" Branstad wrote.
\"In contrast, at the aviskiosken down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting votes and will not see any true reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic orbit, given that the media is below the fixed thumb of the Chinese Communist Party \"creating him.
He added that \"one of China's most prominent newspapers defused the offer to publish - his article, although he did not say which of a newspaper.
Republicans disband female voters during the midterm with Kavanaugh Debacle, warns analysts.
As many top Republicans are stand-by and defend the Supreme Court-elected Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple allegations of sexual abuse, the analyst has warned that they will probably see a setback, especially from women, in the upcoming midway elections.
The feelings around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans are on record that they already wanted to proceed with a voice.
These things cannot be undone, Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at Syracuse Universitys Maxwell School, says to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) last moment's pressure for an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
\"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they're not going to forget it tomorrow, and not in November,\" said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday. Washington, DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang \"November comes!\" while demonstrating in the hall of the Senate when the Republicans, who govern the Court Committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
\"Democracy enthusiasm and motivation are going to be outside the chart,\" said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartic political analyst, to the news page.
\"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 year olds, who, while not liking the president, often do not vote.\"
Even before Ford's public testimony as detailed stated the allegations of sexual abuse directed at the Supreme Court nominated, analysts suggested that a setback could follow if Republicans pushed forward with the confirmation.
\"This has become a confused root of GOP,\" said Michael Steele, former leader of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
\"It's not just about the vote of the committee or final vote or whether Kavanaugh is set on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they've treated her,\" Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps choose Democrats, pointed to for the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be a little split over who to believe in in the wake of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more siding with the latter.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied under his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, and also at least another complainer, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford quotes to the Judiciary Committee of the Senate under oath last week that Kavanaugh completely assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her sex organs while attending a party during the time they studied at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The final project of technology legends, Inrupt, is a company built by Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where data is stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the meaning of Inrupt is \"world domination\".
\"We have to do it now,\" he said about the start-up.
\"It's a historic moment.\"
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own \"personal online data storage\" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, memoirs, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a web browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online store is that it is completely up to the user who can access any kind of information.
The company calls it \"personal authority through data.\"
The idea of Inrupt, according to the managing director of the company John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, processes, and appropriate abilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some added developers with contracts to work on the project, as well as a community of volunteer coders.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team do not talk to \"Facebook and Google about not introducing a complete change where all their business models are completely turned on their heads overnight.
\"We don't ask for their permission.\"
In a media post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web collection built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice with great influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of the Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
\"I'm unlikely optimistic about this next era online,\" added Berners-Lee ten l.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross Divine Feira
The only English church goddess to win a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Pastor Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Belleglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was \"brilliant symbolic\", that the stone would be unveiled just 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning performance.
According to London Gazette, Lt Col Vann hired his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918 \"through a very thick shot and under heavy fire from field and machine gun.\"
He later ran up to the front line, and with the \"greatest gallantry\" led the line forward before he alone rushed forward with a field gun and knocked out three of the group.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a little over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of his grandfather were \"something I know I could never live up to, but something I'm adept at.\"
He and his brother Dr James Vann also added a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to play a role in the parade, adding that \"the value of a real hero is shown by the support given by many people.\"
The MMA fans were up all night to see Bellator 206, they got Peppa Gris instead.
Just imagine this, you've been up all night to see a pack of Bellator 206 but you won't see the main event.
The San Jose bill contained 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown live through the night of Britain on channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just in the Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald preparing to meet each other, viewers in the UK were again drugged when the coverages changed to Peppa Gris.
Some were little impressed after they had stayed awake to the early hours especially for the match.
A fan on Twitter created the switch to the children's comic as \"a kind of sick joke.\"
\"It's public regulation that at 6 a.m. if the inside wasn't owned that way, then they had to switch to the program to the children,\" said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the transfer.
\"The Peppa Pig, \"Yes.\"
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will work on planning to include British viewers in the future.
\"I think that when I think about replay, I think we can probably figure it out,\" Coker said.
\"But the clock is six in the morning on a Sunday, and we can't figure this out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, as it passed, there were many texts going back and forth, and everyone was not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, next time it won't happen.
We keep it to five games instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to deliver to the fans, and we just went over.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt \"submissive\" because of sexuality
The Olympic stupor Tom Daley says that in his upbringing he felt worse than everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went on to further school that \"not everyone is like me.\"
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island disks presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gays' rights to give others \"hope\".
He also said to become a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular reporter in the cross-country shows, Kirsty Young, has taken off for several months due to illness.
What could look like a lost in Laverne's first program, Daly said he felt \"less than\" anyone else who grew up because \"it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls.\"
He said: \"Fram to today, the feeling of feeling less than and feeling different, was the real things that have given me the power and strength to be blessed.\"
He would prove that he was \"whatever,\" he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-gog bronze Olympic medalist has been a professional LGBT campaign and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke out because he felt fortunate that he could live open without predicaments and wanted to give others \"hope\".
The three-time World Champion said that falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - \"surprised me.\"
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
\"When you go through so much at such a young age\" — he went to his first Olympic 14 year old and his father died of cancer three years later — he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and downs.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said the whole \"his\" perspective had changed.
\"If you had asked me last year, then all about I need to win a gold medal,\" he said.
“You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Mi Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie.\"
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about was whether they had tickets to London in 2012 - when he wanted to be on the first row.
\"I couldn't tell him that you're not going to be on the front row,\" he said.
\"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally recognized that he was not invincible,\" he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
\"I only knew this was what I had been delaying my entire life - to dive in front of a home audience on an Olympic game, where fans had no better sense,\" he said.
It also inspired his first song election - Stolt by Heather Small - which had vibrated with him in the construction of the Olympics and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of form sit Mickelson on the bench on Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he must turn his shape to avoid it being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a record 12 times, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in front of Saturday's golf game in fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, which he has often been for the United States, the five-time big winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game within the range of the hope of correcting what bothers him.
Never most competent long-code. Not even on top of his career, the 48-year-old is best at hitting with the longitudinal code on the tronge, French main track, where balls hit outside if the golf player is not exactly with the battles.
And if the path itself is not scary enough, Mickelson meets in the ninth game Sunday, the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined the rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If Americans, four points down by starting the 12 single games, get to a hot start, Mickelson's game can be entirely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
\"He completely understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on his back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,\" Furyk said.
\"He has great confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer, and he has added so much to these made in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he played two games.
I saw more, but that's how it was, and that's how we thought we had to do.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.\"
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven halfs, although Furyk said that his proximity caused some intangible properties to the team.
\"He's funny, he's sarcastic, entertaining, likes to have fun with people and he's a nice guy to have in the team room,\" he explained.
\"I think the younger players had fun that got an association with him too, this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than just to play.\"
Europe Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead on the way into the last few days singles of the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an unpleasant trip.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side captain of Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came across the finish line with the nose leading with the narrowest margins, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
\"You continue to remind yourself that we had a great lead on Valderrama; we had a great lead on Brookline, where we lost, and on Valderrama, where we won, but only so far,\" said Bjørn, having seen Class 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to rent 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
You go to full opening tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
I've said all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we're so well aware of what's over on the other side - the biggest players in the world.\"
Glad how his players have performed on a tough golf course, Bjørn added: \"I would never take the lead.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow, there are the individual achievements coming forward, and there is another thing to do.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you’re out there individually, you’re being tested full of your capacity as a golfer.
That's the message you need to convey to players; get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he must go and get the best out of himself as well.\"
Unlike Bjørn, opposite number Jim Furykk will be on lookout for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been at both ends of the reverse operations in the big last days, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before he quit losing as Europe left the \"Miracle in Medinah.\"
\"I remember every fucking word of it,\" he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, had collected his players heading into the last day.
\"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to get started with the quick start you saw on Brookline, as you watched Medinah.
When the moment gets to go a way, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle of the games.
We set up our line-up corresponding and put the boys going in a way that feels good, you know, we're trying to do something magical tomorrow.\"
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the game and meeting Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the scheme.
\"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way through,\" Bjorn said about his choices of singles.
Germany’s new warships have been postponed once again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have been ordered in 2014 to replace aging warships from the Cold War Age, but it will not be there until at least next year due to the wrong system and defamatory costs, local media reported.
Starting the Rhineland-Pfalz, the leader ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military spokesman.
The vessel would have joined the fleet in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships the Sea Defense ordered back in 2007, comes as a substitute for the aging Bremen class frigates.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful gun, a variety of anti-fly and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from the ports at home.
Nevertheless, continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships, which allegedly allow Germany to exercise power abroad, will already be outdated when entering service, note Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 fracturing made headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There was little known about the causes of the return, but the German media quoted a number of important \"software and hardware errors\" that made the warship useless if they were deployed on a combat task.
Software errors were especially important when the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half of the workforce of older Bremen fregates.
It also proved that the ship is dramatically overweight, reducing performance and limiting the ability of the fleet to add future upgrades.
The 700-ton Rhineland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the wrong hardware, the price of the entire project - including training the crew - is also a problem.
It has been said to have reached staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from initial €2.2 billion (EURO)
Problems related to the latest frigates, are particularly important in light of the recent warnings that Germany's fleet power decreases.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the fleet is in fact \"has almost ended on distribution-competent ships\".
The officer said the problem has built on itself over time, because old ships were discontinued, but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were able to join the fleet.
National Trust theft on secret life of bats
New research conducted on an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in the pursuit of food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles and also brown long-haired and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important places around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS additions and volunteers will also perform mobile searches using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bat calls and what species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural scientist for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitats, natural homes, are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the acquisition of meadows and how it is best to maintain the same woodlands for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the United Kingdom have decreased significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects resting and loss of habitats/buy sites.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as fly papers and some chemical treatments of building materials, and also attacks of pet animal cats.
The bats are not really blind.
However, due to their nightly hunting habits, their island is more useful than their eyes when it comes to capturing prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to find errors and obstacles in their flight route.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, the bats take very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, rest space inspections, and sometimes save lives.
The organization has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve on the Three Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property Manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
\"Here on Three we have a great area for bats,\" he said.
\"We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitats.
But there's a lot about bats still unknown, so the work we do here and on other property, will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.\"
He underscores the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance within property, as it is possible that infinitive destruction of a single settlement can kill up to 400 women's bats and young people, and perhaps eroding an entire local population.
The bats are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, torment or disrupt them or destroy their resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come in and help.
She said: \"We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are dangerous.\"
Ronaldo rejects election debt in what lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the electoral debt against himself as \"false news\", saying people \"want to highlight themselves\" by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of electing an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is claimed to have paid her $375.000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live instagram video Ronaldo, 33, says to his 142 million followers just hours after the charges, that the charges are \"false news.\"
\"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news, five times the Goldball winner says into the camera.
\"They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They will be known to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything good, \"let the player smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called \"an unacceptable reporting of suspicions within the area of privacy\", according to Reuters
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for \"moral damage in an amount that accounts for the severity of the rule breach , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.\"
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, claiming that he should have chosen her anal, according to documents submitted at Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the supposed incident and told him he was \"99 percent\" a \"good guy\" and failed with \"one percent\".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs taken from her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed on an equalization because she felt \"smoothed by retaliation\" and was worried about \"to be publicly adept.\"
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to change the settlement as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'want to forever undo' to lose car manufacturers
Britain \"would undo it forever\" if it lost its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was \"about\" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
\"We need a deal,\" Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of limit delays in the event of a non-contractual Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, where 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
\"My concept is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we see production stop at our factory,\" said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director of Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have raised fears of leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns about what car manufacturers say are the risk of supply chains in the event of a non-contractual Brexit.
Toyota's production line is driven on a \"just-in-time\" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both Britain and the EU for cars ordered.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, disruptions may occur at the border which the industry says may lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day values of inventory at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Checkers' plan for future relations with the EU is \"nearly calibrated to avoid the controls at the border.\"
\"We must have an appointment. We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I say, not just to enjoy the success today, but for us to seize this possibility, \"he told BBC Radio 4's daily program.
\"Provided from not only Toyota, but other manufacturers are that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.\"
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term they warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the Unite Union Association at the plant, said that his members are more concerned with: \"After my experience, when these jobs go, they never come back.
A spokesperson to the government said: \"We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.\"
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-ranking meeting with deputy lawyer Rod Rosenstein could be \"pressed back a week\" as the fight against the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Council Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election involvement, links between Trump helpers and Russia and potential obstacles of justice by the president.
No matter Trump will say up the general of the plaintiffs or not, thus putting Mueller's independence at risk, has given nourishment to Washington gossip for several months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed a lead to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president using the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and it was reported that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the UN in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would \"advise\" not kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid crashing with the Senate Commission hearing where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who have charged him with sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, quote.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying full vote from the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: \"It has not been set any date. It can be this week, but I can and see that it is delayed yet another week due to everything else happening in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep pressure up to date.\"
Some reporters will probably disagree with it: Sanders has not held a press orientation for the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of orientations was not due to a dissatisfaction with TV reporters' game for the gallery, although she said: \"I am not disunited in that they do.\"
She mentioned and that direct contact between Trump and the press is going to increase.
\"The president holds more press conferences than any president has done before,\" she said - right enough without making evidence of the claim. \"We've looked at the speech.\"
Sanders says updates will still happen, but \"if the pressure gets the chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do it this way, and you've seen us do it often over the past few weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press orientation if you can talk directly to the President of the United States.\"
Trump even accepts questions when travelling from the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It is unusual for the president to hold press conferences alone.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, where he acted leading reporters without shame, and almost bizarre.
Health secretary writing about Brexit fear of workers from the EU at NHS in Scotland
The health secretary has written to EU workers working at NHS, Scotland to express gratitude and an desire that they continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter even though there are less than six months left before Britain withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to taking on the costs of applications that have the status of residents of the EU working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote as follows: \"In the summer, negotiations on withdrawal between Britain and the EU have continued, and it is approaching the expected conclusion of the fall.
Nevertheless, the British government has stepped up preparations in case there is no agreement.
I understand that this must be a difficult time for you all.
Therefore, I will now repeat how much price I put on the contributions of all added, no matter what nationality they have.
Colleagues from the EU, and beyond, carry valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work in the health sector and are beneficial to patients and communities.
Scotland is clearly diving home, and we would like you to stay here.\"
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after head injury
Linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays on Tennessee State Tigers, went through an emergency operation after pulling on an injury in the head when the team lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports The Tennessee newspaper.
Head coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
\"He came to the sideline and collapsed, in a way,\" Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and bringing him back for further evaluation.
An official Tennessee State spokesman, WSMV told that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
There is no detail about the extent of the injury yet, Harris said, adding that Tennessee State is still trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie runs second year at the university, and is in his first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before he was injured in Saturday's game, and is now up in 18 total this season.
Foreign buyers have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. The extra income should be used to help the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives
The decision will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
Increase in document fees will be added to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects an increase of up to 120 million pounds a year - to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher document fee when buying ownership in the UK. The additional income should be used to help the homeless.
This decision will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn has had in attracting young voters who serve a lot, with the promise to offer reasonable settlements.
The increase in document fees will be added to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will strengthen the government's desire to reduce the number of turnovers.
The fee, which comes in addition to the current document fee, includes the higher levels that were introduced two years ago at the residence number two and rental residences, can be at as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects the decision to bring in up to 120 million pounds a year.
Approximately 13 percent of new builds in London are bought up by residents outside the UK. This makes prices higher, and it becomes harder for first-time buyers to enter the residential market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become \"sport cities\" because of the large number of foreign buyers who most of the time remain in other countries.
This new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson would cut the document fee to help more young people buy their first home.
He charged large construction companies to keep prices up by getting ownership, but not using them, and asked Theresa May to give up the quotas on reasonable residential sites to fix the UK's \"city comb\".
Corbyn has announced a series of conspicuous proposals for residential reforms, including controlled rentals and the closing of expulsions for no reason.
He will and give advice greater power to build new settlements.
May said: \"Last year I said I would dedicated my position to bringing back the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
It means fixing the ruined residential market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
Nevertheless, it may not be right that it should be as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, or foreign firms, to buy housing as it is for hard-working, British settlers.
For many people, the dream of own settlement has fallen too far away, and the autism of being renegades is real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his \"ultimate ambition\" is to become manager of Scotland at some point.
The shot (42) glows over the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east. Currently they are in third place in League One, only three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, having led St Mirren back to the Scottish elite series last season.
\"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I had a B national battle, and that was it,\" Ross told Scotland's BBC Sportssound.
\"But I grew up watching Scotland on Hamden along with my father, and there has always been something that has pulled me back.
That possibility can only come if I am successful as a club manager.\"
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager, include Dick Advocate, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he has not been anxious to come after so many established names in such a large club, since he has previously refused approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
\"For the moment, success for me will be measured in whether I 'can get this club back in the Premier League.\"
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they belong in the Premier League,\" he said.
\"It's not easy to get them there, but I can probably just look at myself as successful if I can get the club back there\".
Ross is only three years into his career as manager, after a period as assistant head of Dumbarton and a 15-month period in Hearts's coaching apparatus.
He then helped Alloa to recover from downturn to the third level, transforming St Mirren, who was about to step down, to the title winner of the championship series the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now, than he ever did while playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
\"It was another road gap,\" he says about leading Alloa.
\"I thought genuinely that being a manager fit me much better than being a player.
It sounds bizarre, because I did well, lit well and liked it relatively well.
But playing can be tough.
There are many things you are happy to get through every week.
I still notice it when it comes to the stress and pressure with the job, but it feels right to be a manager.
I have always wanted to be a manager, and now I am. It's the most comfortable I've felt in my own body throughout my adult life.\"
Sunday, September 30, you can hear the full interview at Sportsound, Radio Scotland, between 12 and 13.
Investigation shows that the perfect time for a half-liter is at 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the innings of struggling pubs in the UK, but and increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, the sale increased by 2.7 percent in the bar industry - but for the restaurant industry it went down by 4.8 percent, showing the statistics.
Business adviser Peter Martin, who is behind the statistics, said: \"At the end of the sun, and the fact that England was in the World Cup longer than planned, means that July followed the pattern for June where pubs went up 2.8 percent, just that restaurants became even harder the frame.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the restaurant industry only got worse in July.
Pubars and bars selling drinks made it significantly better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubars selling food, got and felt the decline in the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It can seem that people will just go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars, the drinking room had increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food had dropped 3 percent.
Paul Newman, an analyst for travel and leisure at RSM, said: \"These results are the continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather, and the impact of a huge social or sports event, will still be the biggest factors when it comes to the hall of the outside industry.
There is no surprise that the restaurant industry will still struggle. A decline in the sales of 4.8 percent annually will be bad to get on top of a lashing cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for operators engaged in food. The time will show if the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can provide a long-awaited breathing room.\"
The total salsaukation across pubs and restaurants, including newly opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the tapering in the release of brands.

One in five children has secret profiles on social media that they hide from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - has secret profiles on social media that they hide from parents and teachers, showing an investigation
Investigating 20,000 students further reveals an increase in ‘false Insta’ profiles
This news has increased fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a \"head\" profile they show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - creates profiles on social media that they keep secret from adults.
A survey among 20,000 students on continuing school revealed a powerful increase in \"false Insta\" profiles - a reference to the Instagram picture sharing platform.
The news has increased fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students say they have a sterile \"head\" profile they refer to parents, while they and have private profiles.
A mother who stumbled across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenager who urged others to \"elect me\".
The research, done by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistress' Conference (HMC) in various schools, found that 40 percent of those between 11 and 18 years had two profiles, and half of these admitted to having private users.
The chief of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: \"It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create places online where parents and teachers can't find them.\"
Eilidh Doyle becomes \"the vote of the Atletans\" in the Scottish Court of Justice
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish athletics as a non-administrative director at the Board's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the most decorated track athlete in Scotland, and director Ian Beattie describes the incident as a great possibility for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
\"Eilidh has a lot of respect across Scotland, Britain and the world's athletic society, and we are sure that Scotland's athletics can benefit from getting her into the board,\" Beattie said.
Doyle said: \"I am eager to serve as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can contribute and help the sport in Scotland.\"
The American, who has gold from both 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996, among his total four Olympic gold and now is a regular guest at the BBC, was unable to go after a drop.
On Twitter, he wrote: \"Today is a month since I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said it was only time to tell me if I was going to be okay again, or to what extent.
It's been exhausting work, but I've been quite fine again, learned to go over again, and today I'm doing flexibility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!\"
Split opinions on the internet on breast pump adverts comparing mothers to milk cows
A breast pump company has split the opinion on the Internet with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers to milk cows.
To mark what is described as \"the world's first silent, sedentary breast pump\", the technology company Elvie released a small-friction advertisement inspired by music videos to demonstrate freedom the new pump provides mothers who extracted milk.
Four real mothers dance in a high-filled barn with cows, to a song that includes text such as: \"Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see a tail\" and \"If you don't notice it, these aren't spanners, they're my tits.\"
The chorus continues: \"Pump it out, pump it out, I feed these kids, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies\".
The advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has, on the other hand, created controversy online.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it illuminates the \"fright\" in the dairy industry.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to become pregnant and food to produce milk, only that the calves are trusted from the only days after birth,\" you write.
The Elvie breast pump sits discreetly in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: \"Certainly, traumatic for both mother and child
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who get to keep their kids?\"
Another added: \"For a violence-free advertisement.\"
Others defended the advertisement, and a lady admitted that she seems to sound \"festive.\"
\"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have one if I was still a mother.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
This advertisement is a bit crazy, but I took it for what he is.
This is a brilliant product,\" wrote one.
Another commented: \"This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who pump (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This is not an advertisement that boasts or judges the dairy industry.\"
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they have all danced with the discreet pump wrapped into their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump, say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely quiet, has no leases or pipes, and its discreet inside a nursing bra, giving women freedom to move, hold their young, and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: \"The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it consumes a wavel and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers who extract milk and milk cows, we wish to put search lights on breast pumping and challenges associated with this, while at the same time demonstrating the unlikely freedom chain the new pump will bring, in an entertaining and recognizable way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During the Moteuka in London, a mother of two appeared on the podium for designer Marta Yakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved in silence to tent camp on the Texas border
The number of imprisoned immigrant children has peaked although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the strict policy of the Trump administration has introduced makes it more difficult to place the children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that standing forward and accepting a child may threaten their own possibility to stay in the country.
The risk of it increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members will be required to submit fingerprints, and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence quotes from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement for Congress and said the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to be sponsor for single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had nothing on their record from before.
\"Nearly 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of these are criminal foreigners.
So we will continue to pursue these people,\" Albence said.
According to employees in the camp, new rules have now been introduced to manage the children. Rules require some of them now to be in court before a month has passed, against earlier 60 days.
Many will participate via video calls and not at personal attendance, to have their case try to lead an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to select eruptions or runaway absences, they say added in the camp. Reports that have appeared in recent months say the same.
Speakers say these concerns are greater at large facilities such as Tornillo. Due to the size of the facility, it is more likely that you ignore signs of child wear.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or saying hated to friends, can reinforce trauma with which many already struggle.
Syria asks U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also asked for Syrian refugees to come home, although the country is now at war on the eighth year.
Moualem, who and serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said emerging forces remain illegal on Syrian soil under the pretext of defeating terrorism, and \"will be treated out of it\".
\"They must withdraw immediately and without precautions,\" he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the \"war on terror is almost over\" in Syria, how more than 36,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to \"fight a holy struggle until all Syrian territory has been purified\" for both terrorist groups and \"illegal presence of emerging.\"
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and counseling both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
When talking about the refugee problems, Moualem said it was safe for them to come back, and he blamed \"some western countries\" for having \"stried irrational fears\" about the environment that caused the refugees to stay away.
\"We have asked the international community and the humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return,\" he said.
\"They make politics out of something that would be a purely humanitarian problem.\"
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding in Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
United Nations diplomats say that a recently formed agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, which is the last major insurgency, has created a possibility to continue pushing forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement averted a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem underlined that the agreement had \"clear deadlines - and expressed hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Nusra Front, who are associated with Al-Qaeda, who \"will be wiped out.\"
UN emissary, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon gather the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition member to draw up a postwar law for Syria, and pave the way to the election.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited - to review the articles of the current constitution - and warned against disruptions.
Why Trump is going to win another term
With that logic, Trump will win the 2020 re-election if not, as many liberal viewers likely hope, the presidency will get an early end due to scandals and impeachment.
It would undoubtedly be \"the most dramatic ending of a presidency ever!\"
In writing time, there are no signs that viewers have gone tired.
Since 2014 CNN has doubled its rating in best transmission time to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has almost tripled its rating to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best transmission time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBCs \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" have doctors on top of the cable rating with as much as 3.5 million viewers on evenings with great news.
\"This is a fire that people are being shut down by, because it's something we don't understand,\" said Neal Baer in the ABC drama -Designed Survivor - dealing with a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the congressional building.
Nell Scovell, old comedy author and author of \"Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club\", has another theory.
She remembers a ride in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
\"Because he makes me laugh,\" he replied according to Scovell.
There is the entertainment value of chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the history coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families may be together again and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes further beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself in the sixth hour to see a panel of experts debated Bob Woodward's use of sources of \"deep background\" for the book \"Fear,\" Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of ostrich to $15,000 - a garment thick of arrogance - said Washington Post) and the implications of Grandy Daniel's unspeakable writing of Trump's, eh, anatomy.
Personally, I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
\"Parts of what he does that make it feel like a reality program, is that he gives you something every night,\" said Brent Montgomery, daily leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of \"Pawn Stars\", about the show going on with Trump's employees and daily disputes (entering a game with NFL, rose Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss out on a single episode, otherwise you won't be hanging out anymore.
When I met Fleiss this week, there were over 25 degrees and sun outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside watching MSNBC while taking up CNN.
He failed to turn away, not when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Commission and the future of the Supreme Court hung in a thin thread.
\"I remember when we did all these crazy shows before in the time and people said, \"This is the beginning of the end of the Western civilization\"\", Fleiss told.
\"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.\"

Money from outside flows into the densest midvalkamp
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district sees an abundance of money, thanks to a conversion of the districts of Congress causing two sitting members to fight for the same seat.
It recently converted the Pittsburgh suburban district promotes Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district through a special election last spring.
Lamb fights another sitting member, Republican Keith Rothfus, today representative in the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, who largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
Map was redrawn after the January Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled that the old districts were illegally formed to benefit the Republicans.
The competition for the 17th district has launched a ceasefire on the financing of the campaigns, between the major parties' monetary, Democratic Congress Committee and Republican Congress Committee.
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a button says in a closely followed special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been heard by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by over 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a scarce advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador due to support for China, but withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama for partners throwing out the Trump organization's leadership group.
The state secretaries decided to bring back the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the \"last decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan\" -- said Heather Nauert, the ministry spokeswoman, in a statement early this month.
However, punishment was only considered against El Salvador, which receives an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development, and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which contained cuts to financial support and targeted limitations in terms of visas, would have been painful for the Central American country and their high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings developed, North American and Central American officials subjected a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar collection last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
However, in mid-September, the top administrators announced that they wanted the conference to continue, and therefore put a stop to the assessment of the penalty for El Salvador.
It has now been said that Vice President Mike Pence will meet the conference, which has been scheduled in mid-October, as a signal of the relevance the administration puts on the collection, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. emissaries quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new tough messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton would not comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations on the conduct of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by an outsider who works closely with the administration and untalked under the leadership of anonymity.
Studèr History
A wait for special advisor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles of justice, which now there is significant evidence of in the public protocols.
According to the reports, Mueller was reported to have turned the focus of the investigation against whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia intended attacks on our election.
If Congress were to switch controllers, Trump would have to be ready in this body, in what he prepares to overwhelm the voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
There is a lot of \"quad about\", and I don't mean to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable - a rather for his counterpart in Europe.
It is choices to take for us all on both sides of the pond, which will affect how extended the game can be.
In 1938, German officers became ready for a coup against Hitler, only the West had resisted him and helped the Czechoslovakian in Munich.
We failed, and missed a possibility to avoid the years of bloodbath this caused.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and democracy's inexorable march is accelerated or postponed.
Americans face several of these turning points now.
What will we do if Trump kicks Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's fate?
Rosenstein has been on deep water ever since this paper revealed that last year he proposed to intercept the president in hiding, speculating whether he is unfit for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times' description is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the recently questioned FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or he is accepted by the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual abuse, and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we in the middle election vote for a congress that holds Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're wrong, because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country I have my embassy in.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me off guard to light Sabbath light on the table asking the swastika.
When this is my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers accept Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that saying over the Australians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a good starting point to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance this season before the 2-2 result against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a leapboard for larger things.
\"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team,\" said the 31-year-old.
\"We entered the game with the belief that we could get something, and came out again with a point.
Maybe we could take it at the end, but everything in all is tied probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we came out in the second half and were the better team.
On Thursday it will still be a great European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough game. They got a good result in their previous game, but with the audience behind us, I'm sure we can run on and get a positive result.
The last year has definitely been tough, with everything that has happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but now everything feels good.
The stable is good and the boys thrive; the training is good.
Hopefully we can run on now, put the previous season behind us and be successful.\"
Women lose sleep over this fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that participants in a survey had clear thoughts about how they would be taken care of, few were talking to family members about it.
Approximately half of those who participated in an investigation by the insurance company Nationwide, they said they spoke to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
\"People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they do not take the necessary steps to have that conversation,\" says Vice President of Nationwide, Holly Snyder.
Here you go.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of yourself if you do not want your wishes well in advance.
Collaborate with a counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices may be a big part of fixing costs.
Get a financial advisor: Your counselor can also help you find out how to pay for the following expenses.
The financing choices for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance for care, a cash-value life insurance to help pay the expenses, or that you take care of yourself with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Create legal documents: Avert legal struggles before they start.
Get a health professional in place so that you appoint a person you trust to oversee your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals act in accordance with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
You can also consider a power for your finances.
You should choose a person you trust to make financial decisions and make sure your bills are paid if you do not have the possibility yourself.
Don't forget the small details: Make sure your old parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down all these details in a written plan, so you are ready.
\"It's not just the finances it's about, but who's the doctor?\" asked Martin.
\"What kind of medications are they?
Who should take care of the dog?
Have the plan ready.\"

Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people are killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, public officials say. The number of dead is expected to increase.
Without the possibility of communicating, aid workers have not received any information from Dongala, an area north of Palu located near the epicenter of the quake that had a strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongglaa, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi Province, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. Estimated population figure in 2017 was 379 800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the quake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is an area that extends over more than 300 km by coastline northwest of the island.
The area, which is an administrative region lower than a province, in 2017 had an estimated population of 299 200.
Fishing and farm operations are the berebjelk of the economy of the central Sulawesi Province, especially in the Dongala coastal region.
Nickel extraction is and important in the province, but is mostly concentrated to Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesia disaster reduction office.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of houses were destroyed by a tsunami in Dongala.
In 1996, the western side of Dongglaa was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Illusion of the Pacific Ocean and becomes a regular framework of earthquakes.
Here are some of the great quakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large quake on the west coast of Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Sea, more than half of these in Aceh.
2005: A number of major quakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and the beginning of April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 quake hit south of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that crashed into the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 quake hit near the town of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people lost their lives.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 quake hit one of the Mentawai Islands outside Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of about 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A small quake hit the Pidie Jaya area in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the quake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 lost their lives due to buildings resting.
2018: Large quake hits the tourist island of Lombok and kills more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed several thousand buildings and left several thousand tourists temporarily stranded.

Federal prosecutors will have rare death penalty for suspected in New York terrorism
Federal prosecutors in New York will have the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been committed for a federal offence in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) reportedly used a Home Depot rental car to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway on the lower Manhattan in October, where he ran down pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
In order to justify a death penalty, prosecutors must be able to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims \"by will\" and that he \"willfully\" inflicted them serious, bodily damage, according to a note filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these events may underpin a possible death penalty, says the legal document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed over a list of 22 charges, including eight charges for murder targets of money blackmail, usually used by federal prosecutors in conjunction with organized crime, and a sight for violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for \"essential planning and overlaying,\" said the prosecutors and detracted the way Saipov carried out the attack as \"absolute, cruel and corrupt\".
\"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco\", says the note.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last southern district of New York has sentenced the death penalty in a case.
The aim, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to death by two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was committed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were charged after being sentenced to conspiracy to commit espionage to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both were arranged in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of regret in the days and months that followed, according to legal documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done was best known, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after watching videos from ISIS on the phone, it is in the prosecution.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He has not pleaded guilty on all charges.
David Patton, one of the federal, public defenders representing Saipov, says they are \"clearly disappointed\" with the decision of the prosecution authority.
\"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty, rather than accepting a declaration of debt for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only dispel trauma from the incident for all involved,\" Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Member of Parliament in Tory believes Nigel Farage should rent Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to \"mobilize the people's army\" today, during a protest at the Tory national meeting.
The former leader of the British Independent Party said that politicians had to \"feel the pressure\" from the Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should hire negotiations with the EU.
Conservative, meaningful Member of Parliament Peter Bone told the Birmingham protesters that Britain \"had been out\" now, if Farage was Brexit minister.
With the challenge May faces to reconcile its deeply split ranks has been underlined by a separate protest in the city, held by Tories who wants to stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep the plan with the Chequers compromise on the right track of attacks by Brexiters, the Remainers, and the EU.
Allied insists that she will press to put in place an agreement with Brussels, despite the decline - and force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package and \"kaos\".
Bone told the Leave Means Leave group in Solihull that he wished to \"deliver Chequers\"
He suggested that Farage should be given noble rank and be held responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
\"If he had ruled, we would be out now,\" he said.
The member of parliament from Wellingborough added: \"I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject Chequers\".
To mark his opposition to the EU, he said: \"We did not fight world wars to be subordinate.
We will make our own laws in our own country\".
Bone declines the claim that the meaning of the people has changed since the 2016 election: \"The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to become is completely false\".
Brexit fighters from Tory, Andrea Jenkyns, also participated in the march. She told reporters: \"I only say: Prime Minister, listens to the people!\"

There is no such thing as a good Brexit,\" he added.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders give say over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes's team orders would have a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start on the race, and allowed Hamilton to take care of himself in what he defended his position the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was first into the depot and allowed Hamilton to enter the traffic at the rear of the lead, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes ran into the depot a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton held the front after a little action side-of-side that forced Ferrari driver counter-villeg to leave the inside at risk of not being able to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started, on his 21st birthday, on his rear row and lay in seventh place at the end of the first round.
After that, he led much of the race as he went for a quick finish with the goal of driving past Kimi Raikkonen who lay fourth.
He entered the depot in the 44th round, but failed to increase the speed of the last eight rounds while Raikonen won fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend, and was a real gentleman who let me by.
The team has done an exceptional job that has both first and second,\" Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting Saturday due to her insistence that she did not leave the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which she charges Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh for sexual abuse.
During a speech at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not mention the testimony Ford had given the Senate Commission directly, but rather commented that what goes on in the Senate showed that people were \"bad and terrible and spoke unhealthy\".
\"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and bad and uncomfortable and talk untrue,\" he said.
\"When you look at publications and leaks and then say, \"Oh, I didn't.
I didn't.\"
Thinking about you?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remembering her answer... did you leave the document - \"Oh, uh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't let it.\"
Wait a minute.
Lak us... No, we didn't let it,\" he added, while he mimicd the Senator.
Feinstein received the letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh of Ford in July, and it was played earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
\"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't leave her story,\" Feinstein said to the committee, according to The Hill.
\"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked about.\"
But her denial did not fall in good soil with the president, who commented on it at Saturday's election meeting: \"I say you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen.\"
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been charged with poor sexual behavior by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used the charges for their own gain.
\"They are determined to take back power in every way they see necessary.
You see the evil, the misery, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control,\" said the president according to Mediaite.
Eliteligaen: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants (5-3)
Patrick Dwyer scores two goals for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee stars compensated for the loss against the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the return match 5-3 on Saturday.
Giants received an early two goal lead due to attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized before Dwyer once again sent the Giants in the lead.
Francois Bouchard equalized for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the league this season for the gouts of Adam Keefe, who defeated Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
This was the fourth meeting between the teams this season, where the Giants have won the last three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute after an assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford served an assist to Beauvillier who doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan got the home team back in the game in the 14th minute, before Matt Marquardt provided for Cownie's equalization in the 16th minute.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants brought the lead into the break when he scored his second goal for the evening at the peak of the first half.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard once again mourned an equalization with a brilliant goal after 27 played minutes.
Later in the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen get Dundee the lead for the first time in the game. He, on his side, secured the victory with the fifth goal of the team halfway in the last half.
Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, meet Milton Keynes at home in the next game, which is on Friday.
Flight leader loses his life to ensure that hundreds of airplanes escape earthquakes
A flight leader in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he lost his life in what he continues to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers got up safely in the air.
More than 800 people have lost their lives and many are missing after a large earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks continue to disrupt the area, and there are many trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues fleeing for life, Anthonius Gunawan Agung (21) refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, although it turned wild.
He returned to make sure that the plane on the runway, Batik Air Flight 6321, took off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower when he believed it collapsed.
He later died in the hospital.
The Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News Australia.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in a larger city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
\"This is heartbreaking,\" he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are afraid that the number of fatalities will increase to thousands, while the country's crisis relief agency says that access to the small towns of Dongala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
\"The number of dead increases while we find bodies trapped under buildings. Many of them we can't reach,\" council spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves of up to six meters have destroyed Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Naudhelp comes in with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: \"Each minute comes an ambulance with several bodies.
It's hard to find clean water.
Small stores have become robberies.\"
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: \"The Indonesian Red Cross struggles to help the survivors, but we don't know what they'll find when they arrive.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.\"
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and said to the military in the country: \"I ask you all to work around the clock to do everything they can to help with the evacuation.
Are they ready?\" said CNN.
Indonesia was earlier this year hit by earthquakes in Lombok, and 550 people died.
Flight control in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports man missing after lagoon plane crash
The airline operating an aircraft that crashed in a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean reports a man is missing, having stated earlier that all 47 of the passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the aircraft before it sank.
Air Niugini stated that from Saturday afternoon they do not know where the male passenger is.
The airline said they work with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline gave no more details about the passenger, and his age and nationality are unknown.
Local boat owners helped save other passengers and crew after the aircraft tangled the water when it tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Authorities stated on Friday that seven people have been sent to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
It is still unknown what caused the crash and what actually happened.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane flew past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
\"It was extremely good,\" said Jaynes.
Jaynes added that he and other passengers were able to wash through the water, which stretched them up to life, to the Nauds outputs on the plane before it sank.
He said the air crew had panic and scream, and he suffered a head injury that was not serious.
The U.S. Navy said that nearby sailors, working to improve a dock, also rescued passengers with a rubber boat that they used to carry passengers to land before the plane sank on about 30 metres.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network website shows that 111 people have died in crashes of PNG registered airlines' aircraft for the past 20 years, but none of them flew with Air Niugini.
Analysts make timeline over the night when woman was burned alive
The prosecution presented all evidence of Saturday during the appealed trial for a man charged to burn a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice's analyst Paul Rowlett quotes for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He portrayed to the jury how he pulsed footage from cell phones to find out what happened the night when Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the defendant, Quinton Tellis (29).
According to the newspaper The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett told that he used location data from several cell phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, unlike what Tellis explained earlier.
When the location data showed that Tellis' cell phone was with Chambers' mobile phone at the same time as he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford quoted Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he \"laug, because my car was in Nashville.\"
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
However, their cell phone calculations showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers died, Tellis deleted messages, conversations, and Chambers' contact information from his mobile phone.
\"He deleted her from his life,\" said Hale.
The defense will end the case on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to go to the jury later that day.

New York children's passports sue couples for fired after \"racist\" text message
A New York child's passport sues a couple to fire her based on discrimination after she received a miscast text message from her mother who complained that she was \"only one black person.\"
The couple have denied that they are racist, comparing the lawsuit to \"expression.\"
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was dissatisfied when she saw that the babysitter she had added, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work for the first time in 2016.
\"NEEEEEEEEEEEI, ENDA One SVART PERSON,\" wrote Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending her husband's message, she sent him to the babysitter Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, the unsuited Plasco-Flaxman children's passport Maurice fired, saying that the previous child's passport, which was African-American, had done a bad job, so now she wanted someone from the Philippines, according to The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day of work before sending her home in an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for getting compensation for firing her. She wants $350 per day for six months for the job she should have had, even if it was without a contract, where she would live with the family.
\"I want to show them that it's not okay to do that,\" she told The New York Post on Friday, adding, \"I know it's discrimination.\"
The couple has denied that they are racists, saying that giving Maurice fired was the only thing they could do after insulting her, of yours they were afraid she would take revenge.
\"My wife had sent something to her that she didn't mean to say.
She is not a racist.
We are not racists,\" her husband Joel Plasco told The New York Post.
\"But would you allow someone you've offended your children, even if you didn't mean to insult them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it.\"
Plasco compared the lawsuit to \"expression,\" saying his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a \"very difficult situation.\"
\"Are you really going to take on a person in such a situation?
It's not a nice thing to do,\" said investor Plasco.
As the case precedes, publicity has been quick to judge the couple on social media, criticizing them for their performance and logic.
The publisher behind the Paddington books was afraid that people would not like a talking bear, revealing a new letter
The daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the approval of the first book, commented: \"It's hard to imagine how it was to read the book for the first time, before it was published.
It is very fun to know now how successful Paddington became.\"
Jankel said that her father, working as a cameraman for the BBC before becoming inspired to write the children's book about the little teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected. She added that she had mixed feelings during her book's 60th anniversary, because her father died last year.
In the case of Paddington, as she described as \"a very important member of the family,\" she added that her father was proud of the inside of how much success he made.
\"He was a pretty quiet man, and he never laughed,\" she said.
\"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having children who achieved something: you'll be proud of them even though it's not really you who's behind it.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave all praise to Paddington himself.\"
My daughter was going to die and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice in haste, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
\"Nad regularly called to say it was really bad, that they didn't think she was going to be able to do it,\" Ednan-Laperouse said.
\"Then Nad called to say she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, \"Tashi, I love you so much, dear.
I'm coming soon to be with you.
I'll be there soon.
Medicinians had given her for her heart to continue pumping was slowly on the way out of her system.
She had already died and now the body was turning off.
I just sat there, knowing that this happened.
I couldn't leave or scream, because I was in a room surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep everything in.\"
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane along with other passengers who did not know what she had just gone through.
\"No one knew anything,\" she said.
\"I sat with my head bent while the tears fell.\"
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I knew how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.\"
Sad women hang their notes on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones who committed suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have attached their notes to a bridge in Wales to inspire and make people who are thinking of committing suicide change and call their numbers on the notes.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to struggle with depression and took his life when he was 18.
\"I don't want any parents to feel like I know me every day.\"
Davis, aged 45 and living in Lydney, said her son was a talented cook with a smile that infected.
\"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They said his smile lit up all the rooms.\"
But before his death, he quit work, for he was in a \"real dark place.\"
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was the first to find Tyler after he had taken his own life.
Davis said, \"I'm still worried that my little brother may have been affected by Tyler's death.\"
Davis wrote the note \"for people to know that there are other people out there who care and who they can talk to, even if there is a friend.
Don't sit there alone - you need to talk to someone.\"
Humphreys, who has been Davis' friend for many years, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mother.
\"He never told me he was sorry or depressed or anything,\" she said.
\"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed that he began to behave differently.
He was in the basement emotionally on 1st Christmas day, when the children opened their gifts he did not see them alone.\"
She told that his death was very traumatic for the children, and they continue to work through the trauma: \"There is a large void in our family now.
We are completely destroyed.
But we all have to fight to live on.\"

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts the investigation
\"I believed that if we actually got something similar to what he's asking - a limited investigation - then maybe we could achieve a little solitude,\" Flake said on Saturday, adding that he's afraid the committee \"come together\" in the middle of a partisan backlock.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
They hesitate because of the timing.
The mid-term elections in the United States are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans do not do well, this will make it difficult for them to choose Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called Senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley that way, then has been Bush's secretary.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
They are going to vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh is able to collect at least 50 votes in the Senate. With 50 votes, Mike Pense, the vice president of the United States, can give him the last voice and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
Number of defectors in North Korea \"go down\" under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, reports a South Korean lawmaker
Park Byeong victory referred to data from the South Korean Ministry of Association, saying there were 1127 defectors last year — compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter borders between North Korea and China and more expensive smugglers fees are the main reasons why the number has declined.
Pyongyang has not stated publicly.
The vast majority of North Korea's defectors receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China views defectors as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, and often sends them back with force.
Relations between North and South Korea - which is purely technically still in war - have improved in recent months.
This month, leaders of the two countries of Pyongyang met to negotiate the disarmament of nuclear weapons.
These conversations come after the June historic meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work for an atomic-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean foreign ministers Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of achieving nothing since then.
\"Without being able to trust the United States, we cannot rely on our country to be safe, and in such a situation we cannot dissuade our weapons first,\" Ri said in a speech in the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh \"hysterically,\" saying he can't serve in the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court, \"hysteric\" and said he has too much temper to serve in the U.S. Supreme Court.
Pelosi called Kavanaugh \"hysteric\" in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
\"I know that if a woman had behaved that way, she would have been called \"hysterically,\" Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's testimony over the Senate Judicial Chair on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and denied all charges that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In Kavanaugh's opening speech, he was very emotional and cried at times with lumps in his throat while telling about his family and years onward.
He criticized the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him \"gross and a planned assassination on his reputation,\" organized by liberal politicians who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court, because it shows that he is biased against Democrats.
\"I think the way he behaved disqualifies him, and what he said about the Clintons and Democrats,\" she said.
Pelosi made an objection when she was asked if she would try to make Kavanaugh resign if he is elected to the Supreme Court, and if the Democrats achieve majority in the House of Representatives.
\"I can say this - if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he cannot serve in the Supreme Court, nor in court he serves now,\" Pelosi added.
Kavanaugh is a judge of Washington D.C.'s federal court of appeal.
Pelosi also said that as a Democrat, she is worried about potential Kavanaugh's judgments against the law known as Obamacare and the case of Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known to be a Conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm Kavanaugh, he avoided answering questions whether he would reverse certain decisions in the Supreme Court.
\"It's not the right time for a hysterical, prejudiced person in the Supreme Court who expects us to say he's great,\" Pelosi said.
And women have to swing the sword.
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of rage, and she won't get it out without crying.
\"We were crying when we're angry,\" Steinem told me 45 years later.
\"I don't think it's unusual, do you think?\"
She continues, \"I received a lot of help from a woman in a high corporate position, who said that she branch when she was angry, but developed a technique where she told the person who made her so angry that she branch, \"You think maybe I'm sorry because I cried.
I'm angry.\"
And then she just continues.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears serve as a way to get your mind out, but there are many who misunderstand.
In one of my strongest memories from a previous job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I branched out of anger, and a woman who was older than me took me in the neck — she was a cold leader for whom I had always been scared — and pulled me out at a time.
\"Never let them see you cry,\" she said to me.
\"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sorry and they watered because they made you cry.\"
Patricia Schroeder, who at the time was a congresswoman, a Colorado Democrat, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, Hart was taken to be trusted on a boat called Monkey Business, and resigned from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought that she could as well run for election as president herself.
\"I had not really thought through it well enough,\" she said to me while she laughed, 30 years later.
\"There were already seven other candidates running for elections, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation \"Snow White and the seven dwarfs.\"
Since the campaign had already taken place for a while, she had not collected enough money, so she promised that she would only run if she was able to collect $2 million.
It was impossible.
She discovered that her supporters who gave $1000 to men only gave her $250.
\"Do they believe I'm getting a discount?\" she asked.
When she declared that she would not run for election however, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and aimed at the smokers instead of the delegates, and anger against gender discrimination, that she began crying during the speech.
\"You would think I had a nervous breakdown,\" Schroeder said about how the press reacted when she branched.
\"You should have thought that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my gravestone?
\"Ho branch\"?
How the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The openings of the trade war between the United States and China were island waters, and while the battle continues, a rift between the two countries may be an advantage for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump shot first this year to tax important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The battle escalated this week, with tariffs on articles worldwide over $200 billion, which in effect means that half of all goods from China to the United States are taxed.
Beijing has taken home and set tariffs of between five and ten percent on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States for each shot they fire off, and the second largest economy in the world is most likely not to go under with the first.
To make Washington stop, China must do as the United States will, but to bow to the United States is too embarrassed for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing keeps its head cold, the U.S. pressure may have a positive effect on Chinese economy in the long term, by decreasing the degree of dependence between the two economies.
\"The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Beijing can cause both economies to go under is more dangerous than people have dared to admit earlier,\" said Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for American Security, a thoughtmie.
Syria 'clear' for the return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says they are ready to accept refugees who will return voluntarily, asking for help to rebuild the country that is destroyed after more than seven years in war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said that the conditions in the country are making progress.
\"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terror,\" he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to regain normal areas.
All assumptions are now in place for refugees to be able to return voluntarily to the country in which they had to travel from due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that went beyond daily life and livelihood.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war started in 2011.
Additional six million people in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would like to take on help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that they will not accept assistance or help with conditions from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe secures sayings in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup when they defeated the U.S. team with an end score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost on European soil six consecutive times, and they have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown of that team of the Danish captain, Thomas Bjørn, reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, struggled most of the tournament. He hit the ball in the water from the tee at Hol 16, par 3, and therefore gave the say to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari did well in all his rounds and became one of four players who have ever received 5-0-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5&4 by the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's highest rank, became 2 and 1 after English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has shared in eight Ryder Cups, became the most winning European with 25.5 points in the career.
\"Normally I didn't heal, but today I can't help it.
It has been a tough year.
So grateful that Thomas chose me and believes in me.
I am so, so happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help,\" said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He makes the relay stick on to landman John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in single play on Sunday.
\"I know a tremendous pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at him,\" said Rahm (23).
Woods lost all four of his games in France, and now has a merit list of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup through the careers.
A remarkable statistic from one of the world's best players, which has won 14 major titles and is only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled to find the fairway all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who impressed with high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, the U.S. captain, stated after a disappointing display from his team. \"I am proud of these boys, they fought.
There were periods this morning where we made it hot for Europe.
We fought.
Hat off for Thomas.
He is a unique captain
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to group again, I'm going to work with PGA in America and our Ryder Cup committee and get on with it.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be a captain.
You have to take off your hat.
We were replayed.\"
