Biden leads the polls in three key states
When there are only 100 days for election, Joe Biden, a Democratic candidate, is promoted to three important swings.
CNN reports today that Biden was over in Florida, Arizona, and Michigan.
In Florida, Biden estimates a 51% follow-up to the president's 46% follow-up.
In Arizona, the position is 49%-45% Biden’s, and in Michigan it is headed for Biden’s superior, which is where it leads by 12 points, 52%-40%.
To win the elections in November, after 100 days, Trump needs to turn all of these states, and actually more.
Trump sits on this day with a crown virus epidemic that the landmen teach him in an increased measure and says the vast majority of the people in question have responded badly, or very badly at the beginning of the epidemic.
In addition, Trump has come out badly of protests and riots that sprung up at the death of George Floyd.
Trump and his government have dealt badly or wrongly with them.
To coronate Trump's problems, he is now under serious criticism for having ordered the federal police to break back protests in cities where mayors or mayors are Democrats.
It has created enormous wolf spray among the inhabitants of the cities, and the anger is spread to other Americans.
Images of the federal police to race protesters into unmarked cars have also not helped the U.S. cause.
The Lincoln Project has just noticed this, but it can be seen below.
Trump won all three states in 2016, but with very little vote.
In fact, Trump won a lot of states with a small vote and won the elections with a minority vote.
For example, Michigan won with only 10,704 votes.
It is less than 0.5% of the population.
Almost all of the polls that policy makers say are significant are showing the same conclusions that Biden is taken forward.
A new survey by CNN in Arizona shows that Biden’s advance is now out of the survey’s scope.
The same goes for CNN and Quinnipiac University of Florida.
Even Fox News, who leans well to the right and declared support for Trump 2016, has published surveys of the same material in their media.
The last hope of the president, according to the findings of the questioners, is that Trump could hope to re-establish the follow-up to important places in the swing if attention in the election struggle focuses on the economy.
The U.S. economy hit heavily after the Covid-19 epidemic, but voters do not seem to be linking the economic crisis with the Cronuvirus epidemic.
In other words, much of the voters seem to blame Trump for having been in a bad position to react to the crown virus epidemic, but trust him better to deal with the economic crisis that is taking place in the state at this time.
However, Trump has gone badly to lead the debate in the election.
Following the riots that have been lying almost continuously since the news came from the video inconceivable as four police officers killed George Floyd, Trump tried to direct the discussion over the law enforcement and its importance.
Law and Order became his hallmark.
It seems to have failed completely, as previously said.
As the opinion polls lean more on Trump, more and more Republicans are likely to say they deserve Trump and declare support for either Biden, or someone else, who is then Biden without specifically mentioning him by name.
This is because of the arrangement in the United States to vote in many elections on the same ballot.
Thus, the voter can simply mark the second party in the presidential section of the ballot, leaving it alone as a vote for all other members of its party on the ballot.
Thus, Republican Party candidates in other offices are tempted to resign from the turnout of Trump and achieve independent results in the elections.
The Olympic Games of Youth in Dakar postponed to 2026
The youth Olympics were scheduled to take place in Dakar next year, but they have now been postponed to 2026 due to the crown virus epidemic after the International Olympic Committee and Senegal reached an agreement on this.
However, the deadline for the first Olympic Games to take place in Africa is a shock for many young athletes.
Volunteer arrested because of the fire in Nantes
Volunteers in the cathedral in Nantes, France, have been arrested in connection with a fire that destroyed the church.
According to the prosecutor Le Monde, the suspected Rwandan refugee who served as an overseer in the church has admitted to burning the fire.
In a conversation with another media, the lawyer says that the man is watching for his actions.
Among those destroyed in the fire were the 17th-century organ and the historical window of the church.
The 39-year-old volunteer who has not been named was arrested shortly after the fire on 18 July, but was then released.
He was then sent back to report yesterday and placed in custody.
“No way out of this...
I am welcomed to the home of Baltasar and Kristjón Samper in Kopavogi.
The purpose of my visit is the new album by Baltasar and his daughter, Mireyu, which will be opened on August 1st in the Lilla-Kambi in Snæfellsnes.
This is the first time the Father has shown.
I am led down to the workhouse of Baltasar where a magnificent painting is staring at me.
Large and drier images of the glands of the past but also of flying creatures; eagles on one, shadow birds on another.
The office is located in the home's garden.
“We had a horse here for the grass,” Baltasar told me.
“The horse works much better than a lawn mower on this shelf and hills we have...
Mireya is with us Kristjón and Baltasar, and she tells us how her work is dealing with the works here.
“Insulations, mixes of paper and cut-outs.
They are all very white and in contrast to what Dad is doing, where I am working with the light and so on,\" she says.
“It’s been a year since this idea came up.
Then there were certain works I was working on and would have wanted to show there, but they stuck in Tokyo out of Covid.
When my father started painting and I saw where he was going, I rethinked my part,\" says Mireya, but Baltasar’s work has a strong baptism in Icelandic folk tales about females and wets.
“When I saw that my father was doing this painting with the candles, I felt it was ideal to make a jewelry related to them,” says Mireya, who worked with Sigurða No Bjarnasson goldsmith in the shop Sign.
That's how I make a deposit out of the piece.
Last year, Mireya’s 72 artists, Academia, attended the discovery at Snæfellsnesi, including in the Lille-Kambi Hall and found the building fascinating.
“This is a new space, an old load that has just been created,” says Mireya, who talked there with Baldvyn Sverrisdótt, who suggested that Mireya and Baltasar set up a show together.
“She wanted us both to show and then we thought:
“Why not?
This is a good idea.
Baltasar Samper was born in 1938 in Spain and attended the University of Art in Barcelona before he held a worldwide tour to study collections and research.
He arrived here in Iceland in 1961 and was fascinated by a country and a nation.
He returned shortly thereafter, met his wife, Kristján, and has lived here continuously since 1963, for 57 years.
Baltasar is a successful artist, has held dozens of private shows, and exhibitions with Christ.
He is best known for his large paintings, which include a wall-stress in the Flateyer Church and French in the Vegetarian Church.
“What affects what I do is the bitterness that Iceland has and no other place,” Baltasar said.
“This low sun and these shadows that stretch and stretch.
As soon as I came here, I thought, “We can work here.
Mireya is the oldest children Kristjánu and Baltasars, born 1964.
“It was one thing I knew, it was clear that I wasn’t going to be a photographer,” she asked, “if she wanted to follow her parents’ footsteps.
“I went to college to do everything I could to get away from it.
Then I realized that I was on the run.
You just have to give up,\" says Mireya and laughs.
Like her father, she has shown a lot around the world.
A lot in Japan, to photograph.
All the children of Baltasar and Kristján have taken the art road.
\"I call it a virus,\" Mireya said.
“There was no way out of this.
The count of Icelandair has been in a grey area when the pilots were fired.
The Minister of Social Affairs considers Icelandair to have been in a grey area when the company resigned all the airline's aircraft in the middle of the nuclear war.
He then said that laws that mean firefighters to enter the apartment building will be taken into account after the fire on the Brårborgsgåg.
On 17 July, Icelandair advised to terminate all 38 airliners who worked with the company while the Air Freight Company's core was still on board.
It was revealed that Icelandair had been able to address these claims and was prepared to resolve the matter for the Society.
There were never any airfares and Icelandair in between 24 hours after the announcements.
However, Ásmundur Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs, says that in his view, Icelandair's decision was in a grey area and went to the right payer.
“My opinion is that this is a certain right to protect employees.
When you’re in a conversation, when you’re in the room, it’s not an option to go this way.
It is clear in my mind that this would not have happened.
I think it’s obvious, in my mind, that people were coming into a grey area there what this was all about,” says Ásmundur.
He won’t talk about other companies going the same way as Icelandair.
“You also have a dangerous discussion about the fact that it’s just normal to get this system up to reduce this right and that’s why I’m completely opposed...
In the morning, Ásmundur was also asked about the response of government to the fire at the Brotherhood School at the end of June, where three died.
The Minister now says the investigation of the matter at the table of the House and the Human Resources Agency, to which he has directed recommendations.
“It is in the law today that the firefighter must not enter the apartment.
I have asked the Institute of Housing and Human Resources to look specifically at whether there is a reason to go into any legal change.
“I’m ready to make the changes that need to reduce the chances that this can happen again,” says Ámundur Einar.

United States said increased pressure on North Stream 2 contractor - RT Business News
The U.S. government has made further attempts to force European companies to say they deserve the North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is led by Russia, according to Welt am Sonntag, which quotes people who are familiar with the case.
According to the newspaper, officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Finance and the U.S. Department of Energy have contacted European contractors to ensure that they are aware of the consequences of continuing the project.
Up to twelve officials must have held at least two online meetings with corporate representatives in the last few days.
Those who witnessed the talks said that the Americans had a “friendly tone” that the United States wanted to prevent North Stream 2 from becoming a reality.
\"I think this is a very, very serious threat,\" said one of them to the German media.
These threats are consistent with Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, last week, when he warned that companies involved in the project were best to “get out now — or risk punishments according to 232 of the notorious laws of Counting America’s Adventures Through Sanitations Act (CAATSA).
In addition to the Russian energy crisis Gazprom, which manages the development of the project, five European companies take part in it.
These are the French company Engie, OMV from Austria, the British-Dutch company Royal Dutch Shell as well as Wintershall and Uniper from Germany.
In a conversation with Welt am Sonntag, the representative of the latter company said that American efforts to excavate “a major internal project — were a clear intervention in the European Union.
Earlier this week, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a change to the law on national defenses intended to extend U.S. sanctions against companies involved in the installation of the Russian North Stream 2 gas pipeline.
According to one of the law enforcement officials, the decision may be directed to companies that pay for or provide ships, insurance, port facilities or connecting services for such ships, as well as those that offer certification for Nord Stream 2.
Both European companies and public officials have repeated their disapproval of U.S. efforts to replace European energy by applying sanctions against North Stream 2, and some have even called for Brussels to work for countermeasures.
Moscow officials have also criticised the action from Washington harshly and called it unfair competition.
Earlier this week, President Dmitri Peskov said that Russia would come up with a new plan on how the project will be completed if Washington councillors keep the new sanctions to stress.
Preparing for further transport of public agencies to land
The Minister of Social Affairs and Child Welfare plans to move more public agencies to the country in the near future.
The Brunvarna area of the House and Manpower Institute will be moved north to the Saðárrkók this autumn to the Council's decision, but experts in the department have previously declared that they are not expected to move to the north.
Ásmundur Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs and Child Affairs, said in Sprengisingen, in the morning, that it was important for the countryside to be transported to public institutions.
So follow a great deal of value creation that also creates diversity.
“It’s very important, we’re trying to build everything around the country.
Work building, currency building, whether in tourism, agriculture, industry, some natural exploitation, and this type of work as public jobs, they are very supportive of that construction,\" says Ásmundur.
“Creates increased diversity, creates better support for this resource use and the nation’s currency creation,
The decision of Ásmundar to move the Fire Department of the Housing and Human Services Agency has been severely criticized by its employees and the National Association of Firefighters and Medicares.
Six men who have special knowledge of fire and work in the department are all living in the capital area and none of them intend to transfer the living conditions to the sheep.
“I think it’s clear that there’s a change in political views about how hard it should be.
My opinion is, and has always been, that we should take radical measures to spread the public jobs better,” says Ásmundur.
“We see that our neighbours, Norwegians and Danas have been doing this successfully.
He says he is convinced that much of the nation wants to see more distribution in public institutions around the country.
“I think it needs to make more political decisions about the transfer of public jobs to the country, as I was doing with a housing and human resources agency,
He takes an example of the transfer of Food Institutes to Selfoss, Iceland's Land Survey to Akranes, and unemployment insurance to Skagaststrand.
“It’s a work place on Skagaststrand today that matters a lot to that community.
I think we should take further steps in this system.
“I am preparing for further steps in this system.

Five dozen arrests in Seattle
The U.S. President's decision to send federal police officers to cities to say goodbye to riots was widely protested yesterday.
Fifty protesters were arrested in Seattle.
Seattle police were using firearms and pepper sprays in numerous protests there yesterday that police have described as riots.
21 policemen were injured and at least 45 protesters were arrested.
Two months have passed since protests against systematic racism began in the United States after a police officer killed George Floyd.
The bomb was sent to protests to show protesters in Portland.
There, the police and protesters have repeatedly fought after the U.S. President sent the U.S. federal police units, who have been driving on unmarked cars, to unthankful authorities.
Thousands of people came together in Portland this weekend and applied the police rules of tear and gumballs when they hit in a rush between them and protesters.
He had a miracle child 47 years old.
The American reality star Kenya Moore is a good leader in strengthening people who need technology.
Moore, known for her participation in The Real Housewives of Atlanta, had her first child 47 years after the birth of technology and called her daughter the miracle child.
“Pray almost all my life to have a child,” Moore told People.
“So I know the anxiety that people feel, especially women feel, to think what I could possibly not have a child...
Moore realized that she was running out of time when she was 30.
“I didn’t want to have a baby alone.
I didn’t want to be a single mother.
So I waited and after forty years, I looked up and thought my God good,\" said Moore, who did not meet her father-in-law until she was 46 years old.
One year later, they had a daughter.
Reality stars say their daughter is a miracle child in more than one way.
Also, as Moore was older than most of her originals, her daughter came into the world one and a half months ago.
Moore went to the Imperial Cemetery, which proved to be difficult and took a much longer time than the traditional emperor.
“I called her a miracle monkey because this was a child that everyone said was almost no chance for me to have,” Moore said in the interview.
Feet arrested in Mizoram with a value of 15.4 million rupees of heroin
The value of the heroin in the home market was about 15.5 million rupees and was smuggled from Myanmar, according to the police.
The man and his son were arrested with 1.9 kg of heroine in the Hnahthial province of Mizoram, near the border with Myanmar, were arrested by police on Sunday.
The value of the heroin in the home market was about 15.5 million rupees, and it was smuggled from Myanmar, according to the police.
Duhkima (62) and his son Remthangpuia (33) were arrested with drugs on Friday night in the village of Ngharchhip, police said.
They also lost 280 grams of heroin, worth about 1.5 million rupees, when they passed over, on their escape from the police, to the extent that it came to pass at the office.
According to police, this is considered to be one of the largest amounts of heroin that has been placed in the state.
The defendants were brought to trial under the appropriate laws on drugs and hypnotics (NDPS) of 1985.
Even though the border between states and Myanmar is closed because of the crown virus epidemic, there is no smuggling of drugs and other warnings, according to the police.
The Assam rifles recently seized 25 trucks loaded with betel nuts smuggled from Myanmar, the value of which is about 40 million rupees.
Doctors ran 35 miles with a mask
The British doctor Tom Lawton ran in the days of 35 kilometres with a face mask to show that oxygen saturation did not decrease when using face cream.
Lawton is a doctor at Bradford Royal Hospital and has worked there while the world has gone on.
In order to reject the theory of oxygen saturation and to encourage people to wear a face mask, Lawton decided to run in the work and back with a mask.
Before he set out, he established a collection of GoFundMe for The Trusell Trust that deals with food gifts in Bradford and around the UK.
“I am a great supporter of all those who keep us safe.
That’s why I’ve been in a shock at the wrong information that’s spread between people’s faces that reduces the oxygen saturation of people,” Lawton said.
Lawton said that he had previously competed in three-ways, but while the world's population had been declining.
On Monday, he ran 35 miles.
“I never took the mask off (no food or drink) and the oxygen sat down 98% every time I looked at it,” Lawton tweeted on Twitter.
Prince Joakim is still in hospital
Prince Joakim of Denmark is now at the University Hospital in Toulouse, France and is his condition constant.
The prince had surgery yesterday after being diagnosed with a blood clot.
“The condition of the Prince Joakim is still constant.
The prince was blessed in the hands of the professionals in time and feels good about events.
It is too early to tell how long he will be in the hospital at this time,\" said Lene Balleby, a Danish official of the Danish royal palace, in a written response to the Danish government radio.
Only a few days have passed since the king’s family celebrated the 18th birthday of Felix the son of Joakim, his next eldest son.
Her birthday was celebrated at the Queen's vineyard, Château de Cayx, Cahors, South France.
The family was still there on vacation when Joakim was hospitalized yesterday.
Joakim, 51 years old, moved to France last year, where he studied at the Army School of Ecolé Militaire, first Dana.
He then works as a defense expert in the Danish embassy in Paris.
The Prince's French connection is strong, but his father is named, Prince Henry, French and his wife, Princess Mary, as well.
Selling the apartment she has been living for 30 years
Susan Sarandon has sold his home in New York City in the United States.
Saradon has lived in the apartment for the past 30 years and raised all his children there.
The house that Sarandon's apartment was built for the first world war and is in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.
The estimated price of the property is 7.9 million dollars or more than one billion dollars.
The apartment is 560 square meters and is on the 7th and 8th floors of the house.
Sarandon initially bought the house in 1991 with his former husband, Tim Robbins.
When they left in 2011, Sarandon got the house.
Sarandon and Robbins owned Jack and Miles, but they had the daughter of Eve.
All three of the children grew up in the apartment.
There are six bedrooms, five and a half bathrooms.
The apartment is bright and beautiful and exceptionally beautifully decorated.
Flight accident in Utah: Children and two adults died in a crash in the back yard
Six people were on board a Piper PA-32 plane that crashed in a back yard in West Jordan on Saturday according to Allen Kenitzer, U.S. Air Force spokesman (FAA).
Three of those on board died, including the 43-year-old pilot Lee Wyckoff, his 9-month-old child and Milda Shibonis, aged 36, according to police authorities in West Jordan.
The pilot's wife is at risk and a two-year-old child has severe burns.
A 12-year-old girl was treated and graduated from a nearby hospital, said Jennifer Worthen, a police spokesperson in West Jordan, in a conversation with CNN on Sunday.
A 72-year-old woman who was in a house that was hit by the plane is in danger of life, according to the Twitter report by the police department on Sunday.
Three houses were also damaged in the crashland, according to Tauni Barker, spokesman West Jordan City.
We have not found out the cause of the breaker.
The case is a study by the U.S. Air Administration and the Department of Transport Accidents (NTSB).
Gottlieb warns that the unfavorable spread of the crown virus in society makes it “very difficult — for schools to open this autumn.
Washington - Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former head of Food and Drug Administration, warned on Sunday that it will be “very difficult — for school districts to open in a new year of study if the crown virus spreads smoothly within these communities.
“I think school authorities need to look at how the distribution is within the community.
If the virus spreads unimpeded in the community, it will be very difficult to open in that situation,\" said Gottlieb in \"Face the Nation\"
Since the autumn will begin in the next few weeks, Trump’s government had encouraged the school authorities to open their schools to students and to offer teaching in schools five days a week.
These attempts by President Trump and Minister of Education Betsy DeVos come a week after Trump warned that the crown virus epidemic would probably “worse before he recovers” and confirmed that school districts in the places where the worst situation could have to be delayed for a few weeks.
Nevertheless, the Center for Disease Prevention issued instructions on Thursday on how to be sure to open school for students.
In the guidelines, among other things, it is called after the distance between people’s insurance, students and staff is advised to use face protections and that students are divided into targeted groups to reduce infectious pathways.
However, the Centers for Disease Prevention did not provide criteria for school directors when to close schools if crown virus infections increase, as Gottlieb says has been “unlucky.”
“When this state of uncertainty and detailed guidance has not been given on how schools will be opened, I think more parents will be careful,” he said.
“That’s why I think it’s very important to get accurate information about which criteria are exactly what the Centers for Disease Control did not provide in their instructions.
Gottlieb said school districts need to think about the proportion of positive infections in society, local distribution and testing ability when decisions are made on whether to keep schools open or switch already into teaching online.
If between 5 to 10% analyses deliver a positive result, the problem is going to be problematic, but over 10% is the threshold when considering carefully whether to close school exams,
“This is a sign that the road has reached a fast in the community,” said Gottlieb, adding that this would make parts of the Florida State, which is the centre of the crown virus epidemic in the United States, difficult to open to school teaching next month.
There has been a growing number of Korean virus infections in more than 30 states and the Colombian region, while the centre of the epidemic is still in the solar zone called the south coast of the United States.
However, Gottlieb said there were signs that it was beginning to slow down the number of cases in some states, including Arizona and Texas.
But despite the fact that Gottlieb had said that it was “significant signs — that it was beginning to slow down in some states in the solar zone is starting to “heat in the coals — in others, including South Carolina, Alabama, India, and Illinois.
Many governors have set rules that force people to use masks in public spaces and stop the conversion of re-opening to prevent the spread of the crown virus.
Gottlieb said that states should consider closing bars, limiting the number of people in restaurants, closing cinemas and other places that offer entertainment indoors and laying down the rules of masking use to overcome the epidemic, which are actions that allow states to avoid resuming the strict restrictions imposed at the beginning of the epidemic in March.
In addition to the fact that many states have made a masking use of the obligation to have various companies obliged people to use face protections.
MacDonald's is the latest company to make use of face protections to the duty and therefore to be added to a group of companies such as Walmart, Starbucks and more who have put their own rules on masking use.
Gottlieb said that he expected more companies to take up a masking obligation, especially where the risk is considered high.
“If we can really control the epidemic when the winter goes into the garden until we get a vaccine or any kind of treatment that changes the clinical process of this disease, then we can do it with masks, it’s relatively simple, something we can all do but that doesn’t change our direct life and allows us to keep what’s very important to us, like keeping some companies open and bringing the kids back to school,” he said.
Despite the fact that Donald Trump last week did not want to make a masking use in the whole country, he urged Americans last week to wear face protections and told the White House news conference that “they had an impact,” he said.
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson: “It’s time to expect...
The members of Crystal Palace were beaten for the summer by Roy Hodgson, the director of the company, declared it to be the owner of Wilf Zaha's proposal to leave the company.
The film has been playing at Selhurst Park for more than five years and now seems to be going, but he has previously been called a team such as Arsenal and Bayern Munich.
Since he is now 27 years old, he will discover whether a team in the quality category is still willing to pay high sums for him, especially at the financial uncertainty of the sport this summer, after a period in which Zaha scored four limits and made five support for the Palace team that caused a few disappointments.
In an interview with Alex Crook at TalkSport after the last game of the season, Hodgson said that “the past is to be expected — as to the possible departure of Zaha after confirming that the applicant had “received clearly — that he sees his future elsewhere than with the club.
There are still three years remaining from the applicant's contract with Palace, and last year the company indicated that 100 million sterling spins would need to be held by the club.
The team ended the period with seven consecutive losses and a draw on the last day of the season, which caused the team to fall to the 14th place.
Zaha found the net mesh only once from mid-December to the end of the period with a long shot in loss against Chelsea.
It was reported that he had asked for the sale last summer when he tried to get rid of the company, but no offer was made to tempt the Palace to sell.
Zaha changed the agent in January, that it seems to increase the chances of reaching the club, and in the next few weeks, it will be without a doubt in his preference to secure a social exchange.
Zaha is the player who played most minutes in the English Premier League for the Palace during the period and was the only player of the team under 28 who played 1100 minutes or more, showing how much reconstruction on the team could be necessary to attack with the funds available for the player.
Hanna, the Korean virus-rich Texas State, faces a high risk of storms in “double plaques”
Weather journalists have predicted “hamfare,” in southern Texas after the hurricane Hanna reached twice a country and carried heavy rains and wind power up to 40 meters a second.
When he reached the beach on Saturday, he was classified as the first stage storm (the bottom level of the five-point scale) and has now been brought down into the hot tubing storm, but rain could still amount to 150-300 mm on Sunday and winds could reach 26 metres per second.
In some areas, rain has already reached up to 230 mm, including in Cameron County at the border of Mexico.
Hanna was the first hurricane of the Atlantic hurricane season in 2020 and weather expert Chris Birchfield advised the residents to be well-priced: “This is not close to completion yet. We still have a chance for disaster.
For the past few weeks, Texas has been struggling with a massive increase in coronavirus infection.
Greg Abbott issued a disaster announcement for 23 counties on the way to the storm, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston and Brazoria.
“All of the hurricanes are a huge challenge.
This challenge is complex and even harder where the hurricane goes through an area that has become worse out because of COVID-19,\" Greg said.
It was first landed at 17:00 on Saturday, 24 miles north of Port Mansfield, which is about 210 kilometres south of Corpus Christi.
The second time was not far from East Kennedy County.
More than 43,700 people in South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen, and Brownsville, were without electricity on Saturday night.
Emergency services in Corpus Christi set up gardens close to the streets to be able to use them if floods will cross the streets.
Donald Trump told the U.S. President that the government is monitoring the design and hurricane Douglas, which was heading towards Havai in the Pacific Ocean.
Sherry Boehme, who lives on the beach in Corpus Christi, said that the storm that had approached had increased the anxiety she felt for the pandemic.
This 67-year-old woman had mostly stayed home because of health problems associated with chronic lung disease.
She said, “It’s almost like a double hit for us.
I think a lot of people have become weak.
We'll get through this.
They are all good and strong and stand together.
How to get to South Africa
In the summer of the summer the weather has been a good place for farmers.
Most of them have had the first beat, another beat is widely started and it is estimated that some will reach the third run at the end of the summer.
The weather has been playing with Swedish farmers like the other inhabitants of the countryside this summer and does not ruin the spring for on many farmers.
That's how it's been good.
Sigurður Águssson, a cougar in Birtingaholti, Húnmannhreppi and a contractor in the autumn, is happy and happy.
“Yes, it’s just been going really well, I think farmers just have to be steep, it’s been going great, but it’s been a very good weather for the last half of the month.
Heyin is a very good end to the crop good and the quality of the hay is fine all over,\" says Sigurður.
Sigurd says that it moves into growth, not least with the Cubans that they are hearing in flats or outdoors, which have been given very well, but it’s a lot to do in roulette.
“It’s lively, yes, yes, it’s actually been very comfortable now for the last half of the month or three weeks, it’s been so dry and good and then it’s so convenient to deal with this.
It all remembers, there is less stress and can be stored for the morning sometimes what could be done today, so it is incredibly comfortable.
But does Sigurd think that some farmers will hit three times?
“Yes, I could believe it, those who were first.
We started on 17 June, it could be that those who were first have to take three things --
The original solution of the wolves - this is how they prevent injury
Adama Traoré, who plays with Wolves in the English Division, is a hugely fast player.
His opponents have had it to grab him to make sure he can’t get past them.
This has caused his shoulder to fall several times out of a team, but now the wolves have come up with a solution to the problem.
The Sun reports this.
In the game Wolves v. Crystal Palace, the medical team had to lubricate something on the shoulders of Traoré.
\"This is something we had to do to protect Traoré,\" said a Wolves official, but what was being worn on it was child's oil.
“The fact that he makes defenders harder to catch him is that we can prevent further injury.”
Traoré's shoulders first fell off the team when Wolves played against Tottenham in December.
Since then, the shoulder has dropped out of the team four times, now last against Sheffield United earlier this month.
News of Harry the Prince of England: The friend of the Duke of Sussex claims in a new book that has been between the teeth of people
Stott told Sky News that the contents of the book about Harry Prince and Meghan Markle were in no way different from the content of the newspapers, the only difference being that the book was bound up.
The former soldier wants to see an increased focus on the positives that the couple have put forward, such as their charity.
Stott said: “I don’t think what’s going on in there is anything different from what we read in the newspapers, except now in a book that’s in the book.
“There’s a storyteller, but it’s not certain that it’s from them.
“I think this is just another attack on them, just like the gossip that harasss them.
“I realize they’re in the field light and people want to know what they’re doing, but I wish it would be more about all the good they’ve done and their charity, rather than their personal issues...
“They never get rid of it, of course, for their own sake.
The support of the duke and the duke of Sussex overshadowed the other members of the royal family, according to an expert in the history of the royal family.
Dr. Kate Williams told Sky News that the royal family had failed to make use of Harry Prince and Meghan Markle's star friends.
She added that the government's government within the royal family was determined, but that it could not be governed by the importance of the public interest.
She also said, “The fact is that everything they did to support the queen tended to shadow the other members of the royal family, and this was considered a problem.”
“They are very popular.
“They had smaller weddings than most siblings in the same position, Andrew had a huge wedding, Anne also had a huge wedding.
“But while Harry and Meghan’s wedding was smaller in formats than in William and Katrina, the news of it was as much because of the great interest of the world’s population in the couple.
Donald Trump admits that he often sees his voice on Twitter
Donald Trump has acknowledged that he often sees his posts on Twitter as a source of conflict.
In an interview with Barstool Sports on Friday, the President of the United States said that his unchecked re-edition on Twitter records — some of which have contained material from white racists — brought him into the most trouble.
When journalist Dave Portnoy asked him if he was looking for his posts, Trump replied, “Oft, too often.
It was so in the old days, before this came, that you wrote a letter saying that this letter was very large.
You put it on your desk and then you came back the next day and said, \"Oh, how happy I am that I don't send it, right?
But we don’t do it with Twitter.
We’ll send it out right away, we feel great and then you’re going to get a phone call.”
I say, “What’s wrong with this, and you’ll find out?”
In the last month, Trump caused great anger after re-editing a record (shared content from another account) with a video of his supporters in the Villages area of Florida where an elderly couple called “White Power” or “elected White”
And in 2017, Trump re-created three records directed against Muslims, published by Jaydu Fransen, leader of the right-wing British First.
The president told Portnoy that the remakes that had caused him the most trouble
Trump said, “You see something that looks good and doesn’t examine it, you understand, and you don’t know exactly what’s on the helmet, which is tiny and you don’t grow it, sometimes — I’ve found that there are almost always the re-discountings that bring you into trouble.”
The president often shares praise to himself, boasts of his opponents and conspiracy theories with his 80 million followers on Twitter.
Trump says Twitter helps him to get through the so-called “fals news — on television shows and newspapers, which he says clearly by untruth.
But the president's lies themselves have often been under the microscope, and now the Twitter records Trump's as misleading.
The GPS system may be unsafe.
Many countries are working on a different location technology than the GPS system.
Engineer says there may be reasons to worry about the security of the GPS system, which is owned by the U.S. Army.
The old Loran system has been refurbished.
GPS technology comes with us at every foot.
We use it when we fly, sail and drive, we land measurements, in industry and free time.
Most people think that it is a military instrument in the possession of the U.S. Army, which first opened it for general use in the 1980s.
GPS technology uses coordinates from satellite in 20,000 kilometres above ground, and therefore has a small impact on nature.
“But it’s very easy to disturb her.
And ill-willed people can easily interfere with the reception of these marks,\" says Sæmundur E. Thorsteinsson, lecturer in engineering at the University of Iceland and expert on risk management and security issues telecommunications.
He also says to send error signals with the wrong location, for example in warfare.
“The GPS system is owned by the U.S. Department of Defense.
They have assured the public that the system is ready at all times.
But certainly they can turn this off if it plunged into the head of a very special president to let that happen, then he could probably do it,\" said Sæmundur.
So many states have begun to consider other systems and location technologies.
Both Russia and the Chinese work their own satellite system, and the European Union is pushing Galileo's location system.
\"Galileo system is primarily built for civilian use.
It may have more precision and is naturally under the control of the European Union.
“There is not one government that entirely governs it, but many,” said Sæmundur.
However, many have also begun to look back to the old loran technology.
It is based on radio waves and was used from the 6th century until GPS technology took over.
The Lóran signs are sent on very long waves from sent down on the ground.
“It’s then a new version of the Lóran system called eLoran, which stands for Enhanced Loran, people are seriously looking at it in many countries to have it as a system of warning, because it sounds a little different laws to interfere with it, it’s much harder than disrupting the satellite system,” said Sæmundur.
However, it is probably safest to have access to as most location systems.
An employee of Senator Vern Buchanan is killed by the crown virus.
“Gary was a professional and loyal servant of the public,” Buchanan said on Facebook.
“He touched the lives of so many and was loved and admired by those who knew him.
I will never forget how exhilarating he was, the sense of humor, and the unique joy he received from helping others.
Buchanans' office published a statement in the past month stating that Tibbetts had had no recent contact with others in the office.
Tibbetts, who worked outside the office, had worked for Buchanan since 2011.
The Florida State has reported 414,511 cases since the beginning of the pandemic, which is more than 411,200 in New York City, according to health authorities in the states.
The data from the state’s health authorities show that hospitalization has increased by 79% since the U.S. International Day of Celebration, July 4.
The data also shows that at least 50 intensive care units in Florida reached tolerance levels on Saturday.
“We told you that this could have an impact,” DeSantis said in June.
“At the same time, police work and setting a law on this could have the opposite effect.
Fly from Hornaförð to Cape Town
Turkdoves, roses, doves, switches, shrubs, and cries are among the birds that fly here to land this summer.
At the Bird Research Centres of Southeast birds.is you can see near daily brief news about the floods, where they have been seen and sometimes their sex.
There are many birds in Iceland.
For example, there are a number of people who like the Facebook website of Icelandic bird species.
The members of the group are about 14,600.
There, pictures of birds are shared and it is obvious that Iceland is rich with good photographers who have the patience needed to form birds.
Brynjólfsson is one of them.
Binni, as he is called, is a bird-watcher of the South East and the South East Nature Hall, and watches the bird life closely in that area.
He speaks beautifully about these animals that enrich the life of Iceland and play an important role there, and then it doesn’t matter whether the bird is large and large, or a small bird.
The Bird Research Centre was founded in 2005 on the anniversary of the Half-Dán Björnsson in Kvískerin Överkan with the aim of maintaining air and continuing the marked natural research he conducted all the way from 1940.
“Hálfdán was thirteen years old when he began to learn about birds,” Brynjwolf said in a conversation with the kernel.
“We at the bird inspection station are not doing exactly the same as the Half-Dan did, but are building on his data by counting and marking birds...
He was a farmer and a general scientist, born on March 14, 1927.
He wrote a number of research articles on plants, insects, and bird life.
He died on February 10, 2017, at least nine years old.
Half-dán and his siblings at the Quakers grew interested in many who met them in Icelandic nature.
In this group is Björn Gisli Arnarson, \"her employee, the Bird Research Centre.
Bjørn grew up at the Exeters in the South and had a rich natural spot in his neighbor's hands, Half-Dan in the Quakers.
But what is it that the bird observation center in Southeast Africa is doing?
On March 20, each year, the Bird Survey Centre sets up a special bird nest in Einarslingen, a wooden dose within the harbour of Hornafjörður.
There are standard markings for the birds that come into the net.
The net is recorded around May 10, when the whistle is started.
The nets are up every day, at least from about 6 o’clock in the morning and until noon.
They have to visit every hour.
The birds in them are marked, measured, and then released into freedom.
Every hour, a reporter asks.
“Yes, we’re sharing this with us, me and Bjøssi.
Now that we need to work for ourselves, it can be quite a puzzle, but somehow we can do this,\" says Brynjwolf.
The nets are then re-installed from 1 August to 10 November — every day that the weather allows.
Brynjulfur and Björn are supposed to be the ones who watch the nets and during the periods that they are not up there, Brynjhulfur and Björn are the ones that mark the crests, skums and various mosquitoes where they reach them.
In addition, they take on a variety of special projects.
One of these projects is worked in collaboration with the Natural Science Institute of Iceland and is about collecting wild birds.
\"The forest mites leap on the birds at their winter stations and then get along with them here to land in spring.
This happens shortly before they start and therefore these mittens are not great when they arrive in Iceland.
Then he jumps off the bird and tries to find another host when he needs it.
But enough about my little ones.
Asked how the birds in Southeast Africa have it this summer, Brynjulfalf says that the wolf of the war seems to be going well —where it over the head.
“The war’s fate here is with Hala in the South, and it’s all going well.
However, there is no hope to be found anymore at Jökulsárlon, where a few years ago was a huge village.
He said that a few years ago, over a thousand kriips were shed, but now they can be counted on the fingers of another hand.
“When we look at the moor and waders, I think it has reduced in the last few years what you find from them.
But there’s always a change between years.
What can explain the great change is that Brynjólf’s most likely about the supply of food.
“It’s all about food.
People can also have their own work to say about the offspring of birds and other animals.
However, some birds seem to have a good time in Southeast Asia this summer.
“One of the things that I think is positive is that the cow is growing again after a great decline,” says Brynjulfur, “but during the course of the years and decades, the school has deteriorated dramatically.
Of the birds, it’s news that it seems like the marijuana is going to go well in its waste this summer just like last year.
Forest trusts and dumuts had fallen somewhat, but Brynjulfulf says it won’t be revealed until this autumn how this summer proved to them.
Let's go to the troubles.
Often they raise a lot of attention, especially if they are very silly and even colorful.
These two points of interest include one of the most popular events of the summer: Rosestar.
“Annars has been relatively quiet this summer in the floods,” says Brynjulfur, who says that in the countryside there is now a cry, and then ring doves have been seen and are about to be thrown here.
When Brynjulf and Bjorn get into their toes, they also mark them, just like other birds.
The signs are international and they are conducted worldwide.
Different meanings can be found, e.g. each of the bird’s winter stations, where they lay and what their transports are.
“It can even be seen how long they are on a plane,” Brynjulfulf said.
This information is useful in many ways, to form when it comes to insects such as birds.
“It’s always becoming more knowledgeable.
If anyone in the world finds a bird that has been marked by the South East's Bird Research Centre, the information is sent to the Natural Science Institute of Iceland.
“We have recovered everything from Cape Town in South Africa.
There was a crevice that we had marked.
We found a crown later in the United States.
A bird is especially mindful of Brynjwolf, and it is the school.
“The school is our bird,” he said, “and he points out that the Bird Research Centre and the Nature Hall of the Southeast are tasked with monitoring his offspring —which has become quite inactive and now he has come to the water list.
It is difficult to tell what caused a collapse in the body, but one theory is that the shoe made a fish catch that was previously thrown by fish boats and out into the sea that it is now going to be used much better and it has an impact on the forest.
Are you in the best place to watch birds?
“You’re not going to make me say no,” says Brynjulfulf, laughing and adding: “As we’re now also pursuing fluking birds, we probably need to go abroad.
But certainly the Southeast is special when it comes to bird life.
“This area is like drawn into the country from Europe, and then the birds are scattered from there.
Being here looking at the birds and fluffy birds is very interesting, but here is less to be found by the vampires than anywhere else in the country.
It is not far from the spring and to the glacier, so the area that is suitable for the observation of birds,
Do you have a favorite bird?
He thinks about it for a short time before he responds.
I think the question is difficult.
“I have found nine of the ten that have been seen in the land,” he said.
“I’m so excited to take photos of the horrors.
So it’s always fun to find birds that haven’t been seen before in the country or are rare, so I’m not talking about finding a new species for Europe.
But they both have Ben and Bjøssa.
If you want to monitor your work more closely with Benna and Bjássa at the Bird Research Centre in Southeast Iceland, you can monitor their work on Facebook and on the Birds website.is
Saudi Arabia - The solar coast of the future? No alcohol or bikini
The tourism industry has grown considerably around the world in recent years and now the Saudi authorities want to get their share of the cake.
Visits the authorities spending approximately $6 million of Icelandic dollars creating a tourist paradise in the country.
The Guardian reports this.
However, this tourism paradise will not be in the style that Iceland and Iceland should get used to in southern Europe.
Alcohol will not be available and women will not be allowed to sunk in bikinis.
How, then, to entice tourists to this strictly-religious Islamic country?
For example, it is done by building a new city where there will be white beaches, moons (of course created by humans), dragon hire cars and robots serving people.
The Guardian says it is Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince Saudi Arabia who wants to put in this investment.
The money will be brought to the oily land, of course.
The Crown Prince says it is not a discussion that women can let go of covering shoulders and knees in public places but admits that it is not a simple matter to create a tourist paradise in the country because it is too hot where the sun is high in air and can not be trusted in wind conditioning.
But then you can wonder if it also does not reduce the interest of prospective tourists if they cannot buy alcohol.
Francois Bozize, previously cast by the Presidential Court of the Central African Republic, announces presidential proposals
The former president of the Central African Republic, Francois Bozize, who had been cast off, announced on Saturday that he would present himself in the presidential elections in December, despite the United Nations' application of sanctions and the release of arrest orders due to his intended crimes against humanity.
He announced his offer in talks before a large group of supporters of his party, Kwa na Kwa (work, only work — in the capital of Bangui.
This 73-year-old former general and commander of the army was abolished in 2013 in the revolt of the League of Muslim rebels from the north who overthrowd the nation, a majority of Christians, in a violent civil war and a serious and long-term humanitarian crisis.
“The country needs a person with experience, peace and conviction,” said Bozize in a speech that was criticized for the office of the current president, Faustin-Archange Touadera.
Bozize first took office after the 2003 presidential election and served for 10 years before he fled the country in 2013.
The new government sought to arrest him for intentional crimes against humanity and to encourage genocide, but he has not been arrested since he returned from exile in the late part of the year.
It is not clear how the arrest directives or foreign sanctions affect his offer.
In January, Bozize said that he would ask the United Nations to abolish the sanctions imposed in 2014 due to the intentional support of the armed Christian groups of Anti-Balaka.
Touadera is currently in control of the country with the support of the UN's extensive UN Security Council of more than 13,000 military and police officers.
He was elected in 2016 and is expected to offer for a different term than his offer has not been confirmed.
The first round will be December 27.
In February 2019, the government signed a peace agreement with 14 armed groups who generally claim to defend the interests of certain communities or religions.
Since then, violent crimes have fallen, but there are still bloody incidents that are often caused by conflicts over resources, but the majority of this demanent country is not under the control of the government.
Violence has forced more than 1.5 million people to escape their homes.
The status of Gareth Bale at Real Madrid is “unmovable for everyone,” says Toni Kroos.
Toni Kroos, the centre of Real Madrid, said Gareth Bale of the Spanish team was “unfortunate for everyone.”
Bale did not participate in any of the last seven games of the team and he took a small part in Los Blancos' LaLiga celebration, and this summer, it is becoming clear that the player intends to keep still and let his contract run out, but the company hopes that he will disappear.
“There’s no way to avoid the situation becoming unacceptable to everyone,” said Kroos on Lauschangriff Endlich was my Sport.
“He wasn’t bought to play him as little as it is now.
I think he really wanted to leave the club last summer and that the company actually said, “Yes,” but that’s what he said, “No,” later.
I don't know if he's still a bit angry about it.
When asked if the situation had negatively impacted Real’s atmosphere, Kroos said: “Not as much as possible.
I've known him for six years, and we've worked a lot important together.
Chinese give Reykjanesby 2,000 face creams to support the fight against the crown virus
China's ambassador, Jin Zhijian, handed over the town's mayor to the City of Reykjanes, two thousand face masks over the past week.
The event was the visit of the Chinese Embassy's mayor on 22 July last.
The news was first reported.
The mayor’s appointment was to refund the Chinese ambassador’s visit to Reykjanesby, where he visited the town hall and met with the mayor.
According to Víkur news, it has been discussed to promote cooperation between the city of Reykjanes and the city of Xianyang, but the local communities started their cooperation between 2014.
The gift, 2,000 face creams, is based on this friendly collaboration, but the city authorities in Xianyang wanted to give masks and thus support the fight against the crown virus epidemic.
According to the report, the masks will be used in sensitive institutions and offices of Reykjanestown for both employees and other guests arriving there.
In the accompanying picture, see also the flag of Iceland and the Republic of China, printed on the face mask box saying, \"Ber is the back of each, except for his brother,
Thomsen wants to leave KR - Calculates by decreasing in salary
Tobias Thomsen will try to get home to Denmark, from Iceland champions KR, next month and will say he is interested in companies in the Danish 1st Division.
Thomsen has played in Iceland since 2017 and has become Iceland champion both with Val and KR.
This 27-year-old man, however, claims to miss Dankmark and wants to move there with his girlfriend Stefania Jakobsdóttir.
The Danish contract with the KR is valid until the end of this season, so it is clear that the Danish company needs to negotiate with the KR for the purchase price to obtain it in August, before a new season begins in Denmark.
Otherwise, Thomsen would have to wait until winter to get to Denmark.
“Yes, I know that the women’s leagues will start again at the end of August.
It means, of course, that I have to cancel my contract with KR-inga, but I've told them that I miss Danmark, and they have a full understanding of it,\" Thomsen said to ball.dk.
He added that he had a very good relationship with Rúnar Kristinsson, a coach who had shown the position of full understanding, and Thomsen said he did not believe that the price would be a lot of problems.
“I’ve also had conversations with two First Divisions after that division was over and the team knew where they would end.
There has been a little interest already in the coming period so it may well be that I go to Denmark before the Icelandic Department stops,\" Thomsen said, but added that it was clear that there were not many companies in Denmark who could buy up his contract with KR.
“It’s not clear now, but it’s been an interest.
I also need to find the best opportunity for me and my girlfriend, who is from Iceland and comes with me.
This depends on a few things,\" Thomsen said, \"and said he would look first to the Copenhagen.
Thomsen said KR-ings do not have to worry that he did not give himself all the way in practice and games, although he missed Danmark.
“I know what it gets from me and it’s that I do things 100 percent.
“I can completely ignore the fact that I miss Dankmark when I’m in training or in games,” said Thomsen, who says clearly that he will reduce his salary from leaving the Icelandic Champions in the next-of-a-half division of Denmark.
“I’ll probably have to reduce only in wages, out of the crown virus crisis that seems to have harassed the Danish companies a little more than the Icelandic ones.
But I am also studying and one solution could be that a company provided me a job.
Most of the companies in the 1st Division have a deal with the sponsors.
“I’m learning sports management through the team and I’m finishing the bachelor’s degree,” Thomsen said.
Thomsen has only been in the beginning of the KR in two games in Pepsi Max Division during this season, but we have a story in five games and scored one goal.
He started 21 games for the team last year and scored seven goals.
KR is equally selected to the peak of the Pepsi Max division and on the game for good, but the team attends KA at Akureyri today.

Association against hunger push Yoho aside after incidents in the House of Parliament
WASHINGTON (AP) — Regardless of the Christian organization who wants to end hunger, on Saturday they said that they had asked Senator Ted Yoho to resign from the government of the Samoans, and that he had done so, after what they called “attack” on Senator Alexandriu Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio-Cortez, Democratic Senator of New York, accused Yoho, the Republicans of using low and male abuses when they met on the steps of the House of Parliament last Monday.
Yoho claimed that he had not used the words quoted, but a reporter who witnessed the incident confirmed that the word had been as she declared it.
Bread for the World said in a statement that the government of the people had met Yoho on Friday, after he said that he resigned to “correct our commitment to stand with women and skin-covered people, domestically and worldwide, leading us towards the world with increased participation of all races and increased justice.”
The Bread for the World website says that “a co-Christian voice — their pressure on the Congress and government to end hunger in the country and worldwide.
“As the Bread for the World is independent of a Christian organization that aims to reduce hunger and poverty with reliable public policies, the organization keeps up the respect, dignity, and concern that Jesus asks us to show when we interact with people in positions of power, wherever it is in the political spectrum,” the statement states.
“Our assessment reflects recent actions and the words of Senator Ted Yoho, reported in the media, not the moral requirements made for our members.”
At the time of processing the news, Yoho's spokesman had not responded to an email with an invitation to respond.
In an incredible speech in the House last Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez said in a dramatic way from the incident and directed her words against what she called a men's repression as \"accepts violence and violent speech against women,\"
More than twenty of her associates took into account her words that the incident was an example of all the common behaviors of men.
Yoho described the incident as a brief discussion of policy issues and that “no one had been troubled, left alone, or had been attacked.”
He said that he saw that he had shown a “stressful attitude.”
The 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez is in her first period as a progressive Senator and has received both praise and cargo for her cleanliness.
The 65-year-old Yoho is one of the most conservative members of the House of Representatives and he will sit in a holy stone after his fourth term.
Wait until the 98th minute in the local season by scoring the first goal of the season
Jesse Lingard had not scored or put up in the English Premier League during this season, until he scored against Leicester today at the 98th minute in the final tour of the league.
Lingard had not scored in the English Premier League since he scored twice against Cardiff in December 2018.
He came in as an alternate today for Manchester United when the team won Leicester in a championship playoffs.
When the seven minutes were reached beyond the normal playing time, the Lingard held the ball off Kasper Schmeichel goalkeeper Leicester and scored in the outskirts.
A long-term goal of Jesse Lingard.
Actors Real Madrid excluded rules of application
Zinedine Zidane and his disciples in Real Madrid will be able to come to England in their second game at Manchester City, in the European Championships, without having to go for two weeks.
The British government has decided that tourists from Spain need to go for two weeks of disease, to halt the spread of the coronavirus.
However, there are exceptions, as in the case of the competition team at the highest level of sports.
This confirmed the Ministry of Sports at Sky Sports.
The Ministry says that the persons excluded will only be in restricted areas, for smells.
This applies to sports stars, judges, coaches, medical teams, and media workers.
Therefore, Madridns can meet Manchester City on August 7 without having to stay for a long time in England, but they are 2-1 in the single after losing Santiago Bernabeu on February 26.
The team will be able to reach 8-year-olds in Portugal.
The Holy Spirit and the Holy Land of the Holy Land
News of overcrowded hotels and campgrounds to judge, at least in the south, it is clear that Icelanders have been able to travel abroad this summer.
Have those who have laid land under foot also been fortunate with weather and weather conditions DV at the same time, saying that the summer has just been said beautifully, here to at least.
But now it is a shopping weekend that has so far been the biggest tourist weekend of the year.
However, it is unclear how it will be this year, compared to other weekends, now it is that events that in the normal year have attracted a large number of people to not be held.
It is enough to name a national celebration as an example.
The weather will, of course, play a major role, but now it is the appearance of a healing rain all over the country, but especially in the south and southwest.
The weather forecast is a rainy day from Thursday evening and on Saturday evening.
It should be noted that long-term predictions are not a sacred truth here in the North Atlantic and may, of course, make changes.
The weather expert, Einar Sveinbjørnsson, said in his prediction of his weather web, Blicka, that it is expected to be a shopping weekend.
He says: Low-temperature high-air droplets with associated colds that too often also reach down to the surface, lead to the fact that when warmer air from the southwest tries to approach, just form low with wind and precipitation.
It is also a warmer air that “sweezes” here in the north.
One of his predictions shows support, saying, “A small wave from America is flowing to the east and with it summer-fast air.
As it approaches, it reaches to “flowers” in the form of lowering air pressure and a reliable summer-fall.
The major forecast, the European computational center to the left of the map, and the United States GFS prediction to the right are quite consistent with these developments.
The difference between the valley and the valley will pass over late Thursday and early Friday with a sharp A-sink and raining in most of the country.
The 985 hPa station is then followed.
This time some warm air will follow in North and East Iceland on Saturday and even Sunday as well.
However, it could blow it together.

Hunting a Actress from Law and Order all the way to New York
“I was shot in her as a man gets such a young shot,” says Birna Hönn Björnsdóttir on Mariska Hargitay, the main actress of the Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
She was so caught up with the actress that she came to the show and waited for her hours together, just to be able to say hi.
When Birna Hönn Björnsdóttir, the owner of the Pink Iceland travel agency, looked like many Icelanders on the Law and Order: Special Victims Unit up from the ages, she looked for the main actress of the Mariske Hargitay.
Birna tells the story of her meetings and the actress in the show Love stories on Rás 1.
When Birna himself was a teenager, at the age of which many began to develop an enraged love, she did not feel like her peers because she stood in a strict position to suppress her own teachings.
She thought she was interested in boys bands and young tough-tempered hearts from movies, but didn’t have it at all.
“I was cutting from pop sheets and hanging pictures on the wall of Backstreet boys and Jared Leto.
But there was nothing behind it, it was just me hiding that I was a lesbian.
She says that sometimes when people come out of the closet, they go through a later period.
“We spend our teens trying to suppress these teens, these shots, and so on.
I think it was one of the things that brought me to her,” Birna said about the actress.
“And there was something about her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm and I was just shot in her shoes.
It ran on the stage of the actress when she was in New York City a few years ago.
One of her best friends, Erlingur Óttar Thoroddsen, was shooting a film there in the city and getting Birna and their friend Gunnar Helga Guðjónsson, to help with the recordings.
“We were working for 30 people and spending a lot of time with strangers.
This is a natural atmosphere when you spend so long a day together so it was talked about everything and nothing...
One day, it is said that Birna is a great fan of marijuana.
One of the women in the film team said his friend knew the actress because he was on the show.
Birna couldn’t stop thinking about that fact and asks her new friend regularly how her friends like to work with the actress and whether Birna can get to meet her.
“She tells me to stop it, she doesn’t know if she can let it happen,” Birna says.
When taking the film, the group finally finishes and Birna tries to convince the woman to try to get around the meeting.
“She had a few glasses and said she’d just catch it.
A few days later, Birna sends a message and asks if anything is happening in the matter.
The woman does not respond and Birna decides to give up.
One morning she wakes up with a long message.
“I look at the phone and scream at me.
Gunnar Helgi wakes up and I say, \"I have to go shower and I have to make myself nice and go down to town.\"
The woman had then written to Birna that her friend, actor and recording team Law and Order were in a hotel at Times Square.
“I don’t know when they start or when they stop, but this is the name of the hotel, you’re doing well, in the messages and Birna clothes herself in a hurry. She asks at the reception where the takers go and takes the elevator up to 45th floor where the group is together.
Birna arrives and waits until a woman in the team comes to her and asks this uninvited woman if it can help.
“I said I was looking for Jason and asked the woman to tell him that Birna from Iceland had arrived.
When the friend finally arrives, he looks at Birna and asks how in the chaos she got all the way to the end was to be a strict security guard.
Birna explains that she has just taken the lift and asks to meet Mariske.
“Yes, I don’t know.
Just sit here, your friend and Bira tell you.
At her side, an extra player sits on the show and they start chatting.
“I say to him, ‘I’m a fan, but you’re a fan.”
“I played it like it was the most normal thing in the world.
Time and Birna are waiting.
The players regularly appear when a break is made, they get a talk and Birna looks around and looking for Mariske who is nowhere visible.
Finally, the friend comes and tells her that he is sorry.
Birna asks him to get in the hands of another employee, but didn’t intend to go anywhere immediately.
It’s amazing that the friend accepts it and takes it to another employee.
“He comes with another friend and says, ‘This is the woman from Iceland who wants to meet Mariske,’
Then he goes.
Finally, after two hours of waiting, the new friend comes running to Birna.
“He says, ‘Ffast.
These are unusual conditions today, there are journalists with her so she will not stop.
She goes straight into the car with them so you have to take the chance and go down and find her caravan.
It is white and it is marked.
Hurry up, hurry up.
“So I look to the right and lose my face —Birna heads off and brings the elevator down to Times Square.
There she finds about forty bicycles, some marked and some not.
Mariske’s motorcycle doesn’t find it, but she doesn’t find it so desperate.
“I find the bug hell on me because I had spent half a day in this, but I thought so, I tried.
It was fun.
Vondauf holds Birna back to the hotel as she looks in the window the recording team looks at itself with spring windows, realizing that Birna failed his mission.
The children are satisfied with the fate, and it begins to rain.
“I go under cover to hide myself from the rain.
I look to the right and lose my face.
No one else than Mariska Hargitay stood in the pants suit she dressed in the shows and Birna knew the meeting — but Birna could hardly move with a mental breakdown.
“I look at your body and hands and think now you have to move.
Now you have to go towards her.
Birna does it and asks her to hit the actress's shoulder.
“She looks at me and I can’t say anything.
But I just say hello and say hello, \"Birna goes up.
“I say I’m from Iceland and a great fan.
She says, “It’s great to meet you.”
The conversation didn’t get much further because Mariska’s car is here and it’s floating on her.
Mariska turns to Birna and says, “I have to go, but it was great to meet you.
The children say goodbye to the clown, look at the car drive away and then break together.
“I’m going to call Erling and Gunna, and they thought it couldn’t have been done.
But I was crying for excitement and joy.
I said, \"Yes, I met her. You have to meet me now.\"
Then we made a toast in the water and a kitchenette,\" Birna said.
She doesn’t notice anything though she admits that she probably wouldn’t repeat the game.
“It’s like this once in a lifetime, to sacrifice such time and energy to make this happen.
I’ll always be a fan of this woman.
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke with Birna Hönn Björnsdóttir on the show Love stories on Rás 1.
The police did not spread the virus.
There is no reason to worry about the fact that the crown virus can be carried with alcohol that the police use.
This is what the police officer in the traffic department of the police in the capital in a conversation with mbl.is.
Tips have come from people who are concerned that the same piece of mouth is used for all drivers when police arrive, get into traffic, and let anyone who is on the road blows.
The police say the best of hygiene though.
“It’s not really a special piece of mouth, but we recommend a cup that people blow in,” said a police officer.
“Some people want to put their lips on this, but we guide people to keep a little distance, up to a few dozen centimetres.”
Asked if it would be enough distance, the police said it would be.
If it seems positive, the police will use a different measure.
It has a mouthpiece, but it comes from a sealed plastic bag and is only used once.
The upper abdomen: Among other things, anise can be incorporated to reduce the pain
The relationship with depression is not a coincidence.
Individuals suffering from gastrointestinal inflammation, which is a disease characterized by abdominal pain, cramps, bloating, windaches, constipation and diarrhoea, often experience anxiety and depression, which can lead to worsening symptoms according to the US’s anxiety and depression (ADAA).
“This is because the colon is partly controlled by the nervous system, which responds to stress, explains ADAA.
If the þemban does not decrease, it may be about food resistance to talk.
Judge tries to stop the decision that children are being let out of the custody of immigration authorities
In his ruling on Saturday, the judge rejected Dolly Gee’s expected deadline by saying that immigration and customs authorities in the United States do not have to release children if they cannot do so with any of the three ways described in her previous Directive.
Gee, however, also stressed the need for the immigration and customs authorities to remain obliged to release the children without undue delay.
The three ways that Gee proposed are to let families who are in the custody of immigration and customs authorities loose together, put children in the hands of a responsible person, or release families from detention.
Shalyn Fluharty, the head of the agency Proyecto Dilley, who provides families with legal services, condemned the decision and said she put it in the hands of the immigration and customs authorities to decide whether to continue with children.
“The main thing I think is that children are kept in custody indefinitely and they are not released unless the immigration and customs authorities agree to it or the families agree to be broken down,” Fluharty said.
Families are held in three locations of immigration and customs authorities in Berk, Pennsylvania, South Texas (Dilley) and Karnes County, Texas.
The children in these places are aged 1 to 17 according to lawyers and representatives who provide legal assistance.
Gee, who oversees the implementation of the Flores Convention on the Care of Children in custody, said in June that where “the rules of mask use and social exclusion are not or poorly followed,” it was imperative to move children from these centres.
969 persons detained in the immigration and customs authorities have been identified with the crown virus and are in isolation or surveillance as of 23 July, according to the immigration and customs authorities.
Of these, 25 are confirmed cases in Karnes, one in Dilley and two in detention centers for families.
More than 3,700 cases have been confirmed in custody.
Will review legislation on the independence of directors
The Prime Minister does not say unreasonablely that the pension funds set a standard in their investment policy on the rights of working people.
The CEO’s comments on the need to ensure the independence of directors of pension funds, possibly by law, will be taken into account.
After Icelandair scored negotiations with the Icelandic Airlines Company and terminated all the airliners, VR declared that directors appointed by VR in the management of the Lifeline Traders’ profiles or voted against the participation of the pension fund in the expected part-time auction of Icelandair.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, the chairman of VR, said that directors would be replaced if they did not go to the recommendations.
Ragnar Dór withdrew his statement three days later and also managed VR.
Ásgeir Jónsson, the bank's president, told RÚV on Friday that it would be necessary to ensure the independence of the board of directors of the pension funds in the approved funds and possibly by law change.
Katrín Jakobsdóttir, Prime Minister, says it is important that the directors of the pension funds are independent but already consider it guaranteed by law.
“Now, the Central Bank manager, who, of course, is carrying out the Financial Supervisory Authority, who has to do this, has said that it needs to take a special look at the regulation around this independence, we will of course take it into account if something needs to be reviewed there,” she said.
Katrin says that according to the law, the pension funds should set moral standards in their investment policy.
It is desirable to consider the social and moral criteria they want to focus on in their investments.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, too, that the pension funds also set a set of standards in their investment policy on the rights of working people.
But I think that such decisions are made through a policy, but not through individual investment decisions,” says Katrina.
“Consistent traffic jams with Alfusárbru,” said the president of the city government of Árborg.
Helgi S. Haraldsson, president of the city government Árborg, said traffic congestion, which forms at Ölfusárbru at Selfossi every day completely uncomfortable.
He hopes that a new bridge over the river will take place this autumn.
Now that Iceland is travelling around its country and a lot of traffic is created on the national roads of the country, a daily traffic jam with Alfusárbru is created when drivers are on their way to Selfoss or through the city community.
Long rows are formed at the edge and can take on the patience of drivers to wait in order.
“Yes, it’s completely uncomfortable, it’s a road trip here and not just on Fridays because it’s just been on active days as well.
There are long boats, sometimes quite up to Greece for those who want to get by on their way east to land and those who are coming west, so it gives an eye that we need to get a new bridge and no later than yesterday preferably,\" says Helgi S. Haraldsson, president of the city government in Árborg.
Helgi says that the town authorities in Árborg recently met with the director of the road and the designer of the road and that meeting was very positive.
“If you’ve ever been optimistic about working on this, I think I can say it now because it’s really working on it and we should be able to see that a new bridge will be offered out this summer.
But is there any advice for the drivers who are in the queue at Alfusárbru every day of the summer?
“Yes, it is possible to go the strait and through the Eymar Bank, it is quick for but those who are going east on the hill, it cannot be pointed out to them to go the Lyngdalsheð, but those who are going to the farms should use Mosfellsheðið, Thingvell and Lyngdalsheði.
Helgi S. Haraldsson, President of the City of Árborg, who says the traffic jam, is formed at Alfusárbru with Selfoss's intolerance.
Long queues are formed every day at Alfusárbru and drivers often have to wait for a considerable time to get across the bridge.
It’s the only way to breathe deeply and think positively.
The future of home-born koalabjarna in northern Brisbane goes for organizational judgment
The city government said that, as well as the area is a vital home to the coral bears, swishes and the grey ginshauks, there is an important link between the natural habitats of Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek.
Manufacturers have appealed to the Court of Justice of the City Board of Civil Affairs for the reasons that the structure is in accordance with the Civil Code Act of 2014, would meet the organisational and social needs that have not been met to this end and “goodness takes place without unacceptable effect”.
There is a great deal of opposition to these planned activities in the area.
The operators argue that despite the fact that the availability is fully in line with the organization, it could be changed if it does not meet the requirements, rather than reject it.
As is the case, the implementation involves many stages, including the service center, child care and 39 apartments.
Official submissions were more than 120 during the consultation period, and most objected to the proposal where it was too large and inappropriate for the area.
The leader of the minority in the city council of Brisbane said that the city needed to buy the country to protect the koalabirn.
“[The Mayor] Adrian Schrinner needs to stop wasting taxes in the fight against contractors for judgment and buy this country to protect the natural and animal life of Brisbane,” said Mayor Cassidy.
“It’s one of the most important homes of the coral bears in the natural area of Mountain to Mangroves, and there are a lot of koal bears.
Schrinner said this week that the city government wanted the Koreans home to be protected.
“We didn’t find the gift suitable for the area,” Schrinner said.
“I understand that this is now going through the system of judgment and obviously we hope that it will bring about a good and positive outcome that will lead to the preservation of the home,
Schrinner said that mapping of the local koalabjarna was a common responsibility for city government and government, but that the government should be responsible for accurate maps of the home site of the koalabjarna that local authorities support when they make applications for implementations for treatment.
The next step is to win something.
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, coach Man Utd, was hoping that the team secured a third seat in the English Premier League today.
The team will play in the European Championship in the next period.
United needed a draw or a victory against Leicester today and was the result of the 2-0 win of the Red Devils.
“It’s a great success for the players to reach the third place based on how the situation has been over the period.
I think we guys may have got over a mental heart by working such a big game, since we’ve lost twice in the past.
We knew we needed a result today, now we can have the next chapter that is with these boys to win titles,\" Solskjær said.
Manchester United still has the chance to win a title during this period, but the team is playing in the European League in August and is as good as 8th-year-old.
A ceasefire begins at midnight in Eastern Ukraine
Kiev, Ukraine - Ukrainian army and opposition forces in eastern Ukraine are now preparing “all-out — ceasefires to begin at midnight and as representatives hope to be the first step towards peace after 6 years of conflict.
The protesters said on Sunday that they had given their soldiers orders for a ceasefire and issued a ban on the use of weapons.
The Ukrainians said their forces “have prepared for the ceasefire.
If this goes on, it would “pay the way for the implementation of other provisions — the Minsk Peace Convention according to the Office of President Ukraine earlier this week where the ceasefire was called a time-limit.
The goal of the Minsk Peace Convention, which was made in 2015 by France and Germany, was to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and the separationist who enjoyed the independence of Russia, which began in 2014 after the accession of Russia to the Crimean and support of the country in the separation process.
More than 14,000 people have died in the battle.
The Presidents of Russia and Ukraine welcomed both the ceasefire on Sunday and stressed the importance of the agreement reached at the Paris meeting in December.
Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, expressed concern about the appeal of Kiev that the Minks Convention should be reviewed and said that the outcome of Volodimir’s Selendij, President of Ukraine, of “the inefficacy of the Minsk Convention, which he again expressed in this call, should be reflected in real action.”
Selensky, however, stressed the need to take action to save the Ukrainians who are prisoners of rebels in Eastern Ukraine, the incorporated Crimean and Russia, according to a statement from the President’s office.
According to the 2015 agreement, Ukraine can only have control over borders with Russia in the territories in which the separationists have power when they have acquired a broad degree of autonomy and when elections have been held in the territories.
The conflict was slowed down, but the Ukrainians and rebels continued to engage in gunfires.
When the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris in December to have other talks, support for the Minsk Convention was expressed and agreed to resume the peace process.
Selensky, who won the 2019 elections with promises to end the conflict, wanted Ukraine to have control over the borders for the first regional negotiations, but the Kremlin government requires that the agreement be implemented without change.
The new ceasefire agreement was reached on Wednesday for the three-page cooperation group, which is organised by Russian and Ukrainian representatives as well as the European Security and Cooperation Agency, and was therefore welcomed by EU officials.
During the traditional Sunday celebration of Peterstorgi, Pope Francis also recalled the ceasefire and said that it would be necessary to “rebuild trust and lay the foundation for very necessary and long-awaited agreement with the people.”
Police: Man shot to death in protests in Texas
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A man was shot dead in protests in Texas when he approached a car and the driver in the car was fired by his weapon, according to the police.
Katrina Ratliff, the police spokeswoman, told reporters early Sunday that the shooting had occurred just before 22:00 a.m. against a protest in Austin.
He was taken to a hospital where he was later sentenced to death.
The car had floated, turned down the road, and then accelerated the journey towards protesters, said Michael Capochiano to the newspaper Austin American-Statesman.
The man carrying a rifle, according to Capochiano, approached the vehicle and was shot by the driver.
The driver then left, Capochiano said.
Ratiff told reporters that the first report suggests that “the victim may have had a rifle,” adding that the suspect is in custody and is willing to cooperate with the police.
According to news agencies, the group had gathered due to the Black Lives Matter protests on Saturday.
The tournaments were streamed live on Facebook, where they could be heard in the fluted car and a few shots fired off.
Marka soup in the first win of Blika in July
Breiðablik won his first league victory from June 29, when the team defeated the IA, 5-3, in Pepsi Max Division at Kópavogsvell tonight.
The shooters lose their third game in a row in the league.
After winning his first three games in the league, Breiðablik played five games without celebrating the victory and had been losing three in a row for the game at IA tonight.
It was then that it was worth it or killed for Blicka who came with a lot of power into the game.
Alexander Helgi Sigurðarson led the team with a fine payment in 11 minutes after Kristin Steindórsson had sent him through the defense of the IA.
Six minutes later, the Christian then doubled the lead following a legal preparation of the Gísla Eyjólfsson on the left side.
The scorers did not reach any countries or beaches in the first half of the game, where the high-pressure locals made them hugely tough for connecting shipments together.
Blinds had all the power of the field and cut the third goal in the 36th minute when Daninn Thomas Mikkelsen shot in the corner of Höbändur Gunnlaugsson.
Then Christian Steindórsson scored his second goal and the fourth goal flashed just three minutes later.
The story of the first half didn’t end there.
The scorers were given a chance for the latter when Sfiði Hrafn Haraldsson scored out of the penalty for the game, but Kwame Quee had then broken a clump of Viktor Jónsson within Blika.
4-1 was the place for the Breiðablik when the half-game disc was broken.
Only three minutes were left of the second half when the Skagamen scored again.
Hlynur Sævar Jónsson was then alone and unmanned on the spot of Blicka and easily controlled the ball online after the corner-spinning Sørva Hrafns Haraldsson.
Hlynur, however, committed a crime within the IA just three minutes later when he broke Alexander Helga.
Vitispína was convicted, and Thomas Mikkelsen scored the safety of getting Breidabliki 5-2 over when only seven minutes were completed of the second half.
Five minutes after Mikkelsen's goal, the Skagamen returned.
Anton Ari Einarsson, the goalkeeper Blicka, then landed under pressure from Viktor Jónsson, gave the ball in Viktor's leg where the ball refused in the net.
An incredible 5-3 position was encountered when less than ten minutes were passed by the second half, but it slowed down the target score in the wake.
Despite the fine move of both teams to add to the limits, including two deadfolds of Kwame Quee from the Breidabliki, they did not become more and 5-3 wins of the Breiðablik finals of the game.
Breiðablik won his first win for a few months, from June 29, and has finished after the victory with 14 points in the third place, two points from the Val which is the seat above and three from the KR top team.
However, KR and Valur both have a game inside Blika.
IA needs to accept the third loss in a row in the division, but the team has ten points in the eighth seat, five points from the drop seat.
There is no danger to the company despite the White House's comments.
Producers of the Hvolpage court yesterday did not stand to stop showing the child material in the near future.
The statement follows on from Kayleigh McEnany, the White House media officer, that the elements dealing with, among other things, law enforcement dogs would be the victim-exclusion culture.
Canadian producers were quick to respond to McEnany’s words and released that their fans didn’t need to worry about the future of the Hvolpage.
A number of television shows dealing with police work have been removed from the show in the United States recently following a protest campaign against police violence.
The group is not, however, among other things, despite the fact that it has a reputation on social media.
At a White House press conference on Friday, McEnany said the President of the United States Trump was opposed to “exclusion culture,” and especially when it came to police.
The term refers to the fact that the comments or actions made by individuals or companies raise a harsh response to social media and is called after the party is involved in protests.
“We saw it a few weeks ago that shows on the Hvolpa band, children’s material about police, were stopped.
It’s the same with Cops and Live PD,” said McEnany on Friday.
She then added that Danish toy producer Lego has taken out of the sale, but no foot is for the claim that the defenders Lego said.
However, it is true that the reality aspects of Cops and Live PD have recently been taken out of the show where the Western Seas.
Both parties are involved in showing actual police work images without being licensed by persons who appear there.
Together for 29 years - Sometimes jealousy and doubt arise
Kristín Tomasdóttir, a family therapist, answers questions to readers about issues related to the family, children and love of the Family Corner DV.
This time, she responds to readers who have never been single.
We have been together since we were 15 years old, have been together for 29 years and have two children.
We know nothing but to be together and feel good, but both of us have felt as if we were missing something.
We have never been with other people and have no comparison about how this could be different.
This has sometimes caused jealousy and distrust in relation to whether the other person is looking around, is thinking about adultery or even divorce and changing to.
When we talk about this, we agree to cultivate our relationship, but this is the kind of nightmare that always hangs over us.
Do you have any advice?
Thanks for a great question and a lot, I’m glad that you have such open communication that you can talk about your complex feelings in connection with the relationship.
What would scare me would be if you were thinking about it in each corner, couldn’t talk about it and even step up a step that you could then see later.
Everything on tables, isn’t it always the best?
Strong self-image has the most predictive value of happiness in the future and the stronger self-image you have, the more likely you are to have a mate with a strong self-image.
The reason that relationships beginning in adolescence don’t always last all their lives is often that people grow in either direction, but in those cases where a common-age effect becomes, individuals can become stronger than many others.
As your connection begins to form in your greatest molding years, you can conclude that you have grown together and have had a positive impact on each other’s self-image.
We are a part of the relationship we are in.
The way I speak, is shaped by how you listen.
How I show myself depends on how you see me.
Relationships shape who we are.
Could you turn around and think, “What do we have that others don’t?”
What does this many years of speciality give us?
I would say that the benefits can be much more than the flaws.
You have formed each other for years, and you can say that you are custom-made in millimeters each other.
There is more than many people can say.
It's worth it?
You’re talking about the fact that you’ve lost something, but it’s important to remind yourself that big changes like divorce and a new relationship also follow the follow-up fish you’re not necessarily excited about.
You may miss out on starting a new one, learning to be alone again, getting to know a new person, and putting together families.
This follows new challenges, different problems, and possibly something new and exciting.
But this does not just follow a pale cloud and happiness, however, at your age, this can become a silly task, which may never be as successful as you have already done to each other.
Is it worth it?
Nor would it be advisable to put the focus on what you can do to increase tension, carelessness, and innovation in your relationship?
You haven't put shoes on the shelf yet.
There are so many things you can do to make this long relationship even deeper.
What experiments can you do in connection with it?
What do you need from your spouse that you are not getting?
What can you give to your spouse that you have never done before?
You may need to sit down and re-unify your relationship.
Do you want to spend more time alone or together?
Do you want to try something new?
Today, there is a considerable amount of tolerance towards various forms of communication and couples are beginning to define their relationships in various ways, e.g., open relationships, multi-tickets, or decide to temporarily quit together.
I’m not telling you what to do, even if no expert in your solutions, but it could relieve this heavy-weight mare that hovers over you, if you look into this and think in solutions.
What do you need so much trust and fear?
You’ve been together for 29 years, it must mean you’re able to do some things together.
Use it as strength and hold your hands toward your solution.
We encourage readers to send their questions and gifts to Kristín by email to: hjonabandssaela@gmail.com.
The questions will then be answered here in the family corner, of course anonymously and in full confidence.
He lost the cup and broke it.
Despite the great experience that Branislav Ivanovic has of lifting the bikes and celebrating titles, he lost and broke an elegant award in joy after becoming a Russian cup master yesterday.
Ivanovic won a number of titles as Chelsea player from 2008 to 2017 and then went home to Russia and went in the ranks of Zenit.
There he has now become the Russian champion for two consecutive years and yesterday the team secured the cupmaster's title with a 1-0 win in Khimki, where the win came from the white-spoiled Artem Dzyuba in 84th minute.
The reward item in the Russian cup is made of glass and when Ivanovic, who is the head of Zenit, he lost the cup in the ground so that he broke, as can be seen.
Ivanovic and his friends did not give it, and continued their joy until night.
This is a war!
Coleen Rooney hires attorney Johnny Depp in the Wagatha Christie struggle with Rebekah Vardy
Coleen Rooney has asked David Sherborne to defend himself against the allegations of injury against Rebekah Vardy
After negotiations between the footballers, their acquaintances expect dramatic settlements.
Coleen Rooney has hired the star lawyer in Johnny Depp's disputed injury to defend himself in the so-called \"Wagatha Christie\" legal dispute with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday announces that Rooney has assigned David Sherborne to defend herself against the allegations that she had sustained injury to Vardy, claiming that personal data was leaked to the media by her closed Instagram access.
The news comes a few days after the data was submitted to the Supreme Court stating that Rebekah Vardy, who is married to the applicant Jamie Vardy in Leicester City, has suffered physical and mental following the claims of Coleen Rooney.
The magazine states that the 38-year-old mother “has had a serious panic attack and panic attack so that she was afraid of going out of the house — and that Vardy, who was then seven months on his way, “had three times been hospitalized... because of a panic attack caused by the incident and its consequences...
In addition to being Depp's lawyer in his injury against The Sun, because of allegations that the player has beaten his wife, Sherborne, aged 50, goes with the case of the Duke and the Duke of Sussex in their private language against Associated Newspapers, publisher The Mail on Sunday.
After negotiation between the two footballers, the two failed to expect those who knew the dramatic settlements in the courtroom.
“If you found the Depp trial games, don’t underestimate the expected war of the footballers,” said an official.
“This is a real war. Coleen doesn’t give up, and not Becky either.
Coleen Rooney claimed that someone who used Instagram access to Rebekah Vardy had leaked the information about her to the newspaper.
She was named “Wagatha Christie” after stating how she spent five months gradually limiting the number of friends who could see updates to Instagram stories until only Vardy’s account remained.
Coleen said he had a history on Instagram, which had since appeared in a newspaper.
In Vardy's case, who denies membership, she argues that she has been bled after Rooney publishes the allegations \"in order to give advice, with the aim of causing much harm and enormous suffering\"
Coleen’s lawyers have questioned these words and say that allegations of her suffering are merely presented to the media and draw attention from the facts of the matter.
The author said, “The evidence from Becky is misleading, it’s all a mess.
It is the lawyer Paul Lunt at the Brabners law firm in Liverpool, which deals with Coleen Rooney, who has four sons with former England champion Wayne Rooney.
Vardy is at the law firm Kingsley Napley in London, it is unclear if she has hired a lawyer yet.
Coleen Rooney refused to interview.
Cosningatemy Bidens refuses “Fox News Sunday” about interviews one week after interview Chris Wallace with Trump
In Trump's interview with Chris Wallace last week, Trump questioned the US President that the prospective Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, would deal with the issue issue that Wallace had dropped on Trump.
We may never get an answer to that question — at least not for now.
On Sunday, Wallace informed the audience that Biden’s election team had told Fox News that he was “not free” for an interview.
“In our interview with President Trump last week, he doubted that his opponent in the Democratic Party, Joe Biden, would plumble himself in similar circumstances,” Wallace said.
“In the week, both of us held an interview and said the former vice president was not free.
“We keep asking each week,” he added.
Trump's election team has criticized Biden for avoiding election meetings and press conference while attending interviews while the Cronuvirus epidemic is running.
Although Biden has recently re-elected his campaign, Trump and his colleagues have continued to mock the former Vice President for “hiding” in his home in Delaware.
However, the slowness of Biden to attend public events has not entertained his offer as the latest surveys show that Biden has a good advantage on Trump both on the national and in the main fighting countries.
Real Clear Politics averages indicate that the president was 7 percent below Florida, 6.7 percent in Pennsylvania, 8.2 in Michigan, and 6.4 in Wisconsin.
Trump won in all four states in 2016 when he turned them over to the Republican Party when he won the fight over the White House.
In the latest Fox News Poll survey, Biden has an advantage in Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, outside the chess jar in all cases.
Studies also suggest that Biden has a little advance in Ohio, North Carolina and Arizona, three other important fighting nations in these elections.
And research suggests that a state that was once the trust of the Republicans, such as Texas and Georgia, is now divided between Trump and the Vice President of the former.
Presidential elections in which the sitting president offers his second term in the White House are often a vote on that president - and that seems to be the case in 2020 in the fight between Trump and Bidens.
The most important issues have been the coronary and economics that are in decline due to the epidemic — and the performance and history of the president in both categories of affairs.
Kanye West and his struggle with mental illness
Musician Kanye West asked his wife, Kim Kardashian, to apologize for the comments he had made in the moustache.
The Chairman of Psychologists believes he is seeking his creative power in the psychiatric system, but psychiatrists say it is important that people take medications to keep the disease under control.
The rapper Kanye West is not only one of the most original and influential musicians of contemporary times, but is not as famous as the husband of real-life star Kim Kardashian.
His personal life has been largely open to open tents.
It was a great deal of attention when he announced earlier this month that he had to present himself to the president of the United States, and held an emotional and disparaging speech.
Later, a number of distinctive ticks appeared from him on Twitter, where he claimed, among other things, that his wife was trying to put him in the hospital.
Kim Kardashian later published a statement on Instagram asking people to show their husband and family understanding; he had a mood disorder, and it would be difficult for his loved ones to help him if he didn’t want to help himself.
He then apologized to her.
This famous family is not alone in dealing with this problem.
It is estimated that about one percent of people get mental illness.
Ferdinand Jónsson is the head of a psychiatric hospital in London, and knows the disease well.
“This disease can cause so much suffering for individuals and especially for their families and loved ones.
This violence or mania can destroy relationships and work and cause immense grief.
And then the other side, depression, it is often dangerous, because there is a high frequency of suicide in that group.
So I thought it was beautiful that she would say that.
“It’s just human and human,” says Ferdinand.
Unnsteinsson, chairman of the Psychologist, has himself struggled with mental illness —and is a fan of Kanye West: “He seems to have a very strong imagination.
If we are four strings of earth-bound double bass, then he is a hundred strings of heavenly harp.
And he is so incredibly creative, incredibly powerful and intelligent in his powerful connection thinking, because one must be aware of this connection thought that we who have been given the opportunity to try it to go into a state of superstition know so well...
Kanye West does not want to take psychiatric medication, because he believes that they are withdrawing from his creativity.
He has discussed the mental health issues, including the album Ye.
He says it is his choice not to take medication.
“Mothers feel like it is staunch to this creative element that is involved in this unhindered connection thought and excess creativity of the fire he has, but so are the natural flaws of the often severe suffering, and the valleys and dark cellars and darkness,” he said.
Ferdinand, however, says it is important that people with mood disorder receive treatment.
“If you have a lot of violence or mania, you’re not making great things, you’re just on your side.
And as people go into severe depression, people are completely paralyzed by that situation,\" he said.
So you would advise Kanye West to take medication?
“Alright,” Ferdinand said.
“And especially to work with someone to find the right dosage and this way that there will be a balance between the medicine helping him the most, and destroying that which is remembered for him and his abilities and his creative power.”

\"Venice sickness - ambassador wants a gun, armored car and sting vest - said the sub-communists are the \"deep state,\"
The U.S. Secretary of State, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, said he wanted to carry firearms in CBS news today.
In CBS’s first story, “Despite being located in one of the safest states in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter is “friendly” about his safety since he arrived in Reykjavík last year.
Refers to CBS in 12 diplomats, board of directors and former representatives as well as individuals who know the matter.
Gunter's outcome was to demand from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs that they requested permission for the ambassador to go around armed in this country.
He should also have wanted a armored car that travelled with him between locations in Iceland and the sting vest.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs refused to express any threat to the security of the ambassador, but representatives of the U.S. government said the ambassador was told that Iceland is a safe country and that it is safe here.
However, had been advertised for lifeguards in Icelandic newspapers, CBS says, and is it a part of becoming the ambassador’s demands.
CBS said the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not want to comment on CBS.
On the other hand, the U.S. news agency after its sources in this country has said that no request has been received from the governments of this country.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter was spoken of walking around armed as it would insult the property, Iceland.
The ambassador was given his honor in the 2016 Presidential Elections for having supported Donald Trump's election fund.
He used to be a doctor in California.
Since Gunter took office in May, he said he has created “an impossible working environment in the embassy and has already had seven subordinates, known as the Deputy Chief of Mission, the subordinates of the ambassador who are also sent to the diplomats.
All of these were diplomats from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
The first one was sent away by the ambassador, \"Because he did not look at his appearance,
He was already prepared for a year and taught Icelandic.
The next one only lasted six months.
As a result, the rooting of the staff was created and the idea was to allow Gunter to act as most people until he looked at one of them.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter has been expecting the embassy’s staff to go abroad “the deep state — and to have submerged him against the Washington D.C. State Department.
The officers of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of D.C. are said to be well aware of the situation in their embassy in Reykjavík, but have been reluctant to intervene in the taumana of the independence of the embassy in view of Gunters' relationship with the White House.
Gunter is also said to have had difficulty following the orders of the State Department in Washington, and he is said to have refused to return to D.C. while the Covid-19 voyage passed.
He left the embassy in the hands of his employees for several months.
When told to work from his home in California, he was ordered by the foreign minister, Mike Pompeo, to return.
Back at last
Finally, Gunter returned to Iceland in May.
His new co-founder, Michelle Yerkin, came to the country this month.
CBS has not received an answer to their inquiries to the U.S. State Department.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not want to speak to CBS, nor to ask DV.
Gunter is one of the many political officials of Trump’s government who have been paying attention to unusual behaviors over the past month.
In order to make up, Woody Johnson reacted when he arrived in the day that he was trying to move the British open the golf tournament at the golf course in the possession of Trump.
The Ambassador of South Africa has also been ordered to have fired his number two and then tried to put her son in the job.
42% of U.S. ambassadors are organized politically.
30% were elected to the government of Obama, and 32% of the government of George W. Bush.

Poland will report on the European Convention on the Prevention of Violence against Women
The Supreme Government of Poland says that the country will withdraw from the European Convention on the Prevention of Violence against Women.
The Istanbul Convention is the first binding legislation in the world that aims to prevent violence against women, while the Polish Minister of Justice, Zbigniew Ziobro, describes the text as “harmful — in which he calls for schools to teach children about sex from a social perspective.
Ziobro said on the weekend that on Monday he would begin to prepare the formal process for the country's resignation.
“This ideological aspect is related to attempts to change education in schools and leisure activities, to study, attitude and conviction of young generations of Poles, based on the conclusion that our opinion is wrong, that biological gender is old-fashioned, and that everything is actually about social culture,
Ziobro believes that the provisions of the agreement on the education of children and young people as well as family ties in the context of LGBT people are unacceptable.
“We also reject the LGBT elements in the discussion on family relations, because this is an opinion held by the left actors or groups of homosexuals who want their opinions to become binding laws,” he said.
The European Council said on Sunday that it was “safe — because Poland had to tell them about the deal.
In Warsaw, on Friday, some 2,000 people, including the groups of women and other groups of rights fighters, protested outside the offices of the Ordo Luris, who support the country's declaration of the agreement.
“We’re not going to be victims, call them.
The protest also took place in other cities in Poland.
Poland signed the Istanbul Convention to prevent and fight violence against women and domestic violence in December 2012 and completed it in 2015.
Maurice Petty, an engineer at the Hall of Honour, died 81 years ago
KANSAS CITY, Kansas (AP) - Maurice Petty, a part of a quarter mile drive government that includes his father Lee and his brother Richard, who was the first engine to be taken into Nascar's Hall of Honor, died on Saturday.
He was 81 years old.
Petty's family did not give up his cause for death.
He has not been notified of his funeral.
While his other family members were famous for their skills behind the board, Maurice Petty entered the nickname \"The Chairman\" for his skills with the screwdriver.
He helped his family win 198 races and seven titles in the NASCAR top-level, and also built machines that secured the honorary company Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal, and Pete Hamilton win.
“The director was one of the most advanced machines in NASCAR’s history,” said director and director Jim France.
“He came with the power that helped Petty Enterprises reach their tops on the sport.
Even though Maurice has been known for his work under the hood, he also took on various roles behind the tents and did what was needed to bring his cars on the road.
Maurice Petty was born on 27 March 1939 in Level Cross, North Carolina.
He followed his father on the race track when he was small, and his knowledge of the motorbike soon became a major factor in the landing of Lee Petty's victory in 54 competitions and three championships.
He competed 26 times in the NASCAR Cup between 1960 and 64, was seven times in the top five seats and 16 times in the top ten.
However, he soon decided to focus on what is happening under the machine cover rather than behind the steering wheel, which proved to be a success trail for his older brother, who relied on his machines on his victories.
Richard, later known as \"The King,\" won the first championship in 1964 with the Plymouth automobile.
They won again in 1967, then two years in a series of 1970 and 1971, and won three additional titles before the eighth decade ended.
With these seven titles on their back, they rated the most number of titles with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson.
“Maurice Petty was one of the true pioneers of NASCAR and was involved in his process at Petty Enterprise in building one of the top teams in NASCAR,” Winston Kelley said.
“Even though the winner of Petty is listed as 212 of the numbers, he calls for well over 250 wins, if taken with all the machines he built for his competitors.
The director will be remembered forever as one of the best machines in NASCAR history.
Lee Petty died in 2000, and Patricia, Maurice Petty's wife to 52 years old, died in 2014.
He was also the uncle of the former motor vehicle and the mediaman Kyle Petty and Trent Owens, the team manager of the final car race.
“Even though we now say goodbye to Maurice Petty, one of the true and successful pioneers and heroes of NASCAR, his legacy and name will be stored in our memories, kept in the air, and preserved throughout the future,” Kelley said.
“We send our deepest compassions to the Petty family.

Serbia wants to increase the number of aircraft in the Balkans
BELGRAD, Serbia (AP) - Serbia will strengthen its army and seek to buy more military aircraft for the expansion of the Balkan Peninsula, said President Serbia on Sunday.
Aleksandar Vucic said that “certain sieges — are about to buy a fleet of fighters, accusing the United States and other Western states of having occupied the neighboring Serbia that is in NATO, as well as Kosovo, formerly provinced in Serbia.
“The Germans, Turks, and Germans take care of their beloved offspring,” Vucci said, referring to Kosovo.
He said that the United States had recently handed over the security forces of Kosovo to a number of armored cars.
In a tour of the Serbian forces, the Vucic people said they can’t compete with “ NATO’s contribution to neighbor’s arms and that “for this reason we’ve come up with ourselves.”
Vucic did not specify what type of military aircraft Serbia was buying, but the media sidelined government said his government has publicly requested the delivery of 20 US attackers.
According to the statement, Washington did not respond at the request of Belgrade and if it is rejected, it is likely that it will be possible to purchase the price of attackers from Sukhoi-25 from Russia.
Serbia, which maintains a policy of neutrality in military affairs, has recently received a advanced air protection system from Russia, which has also provided fighter jets, attack helicopters and armored vehicles.
China, which is also a federation of Serbia, has handed over the state dragons for use in warfare.
U.S. officials have openly discussed criminal offences against Serbia if more weapons come to the country from Moscow, especially weapons that could put the security of nearby NATO member states at risk.
In the West and in the neighboring countries of Serbia, people are concerned about Russian and Chinese arms warfare in Serbia.
The tension is now increasing in the Balkans, where civil war was fought in the decade.
The Atlantic League had been engaged by Serbia to stop the bloody actions of Serba against the separationists of Kosovo-Albana in 1999.
Despite having formally sought to walk in the European Union, the popular leader of Serbia has further strengthened its political and military relationship with the Kremlin and Beijing.
Serbia, as well as Russia and China, do not recognize the independence of Kosovo, which the United States and most Western countries have recognized.
Heart attack: The likelihood of this fatal disease may be reduced by eating chocolate once a week
A new study suggests that certain goodies may be good for the heart muscle.
What is it? And how could it reduce the chances of heart attack?
Scientists have made a collection analysis of coronary artery disease that spans five decades.
The main symptoms of coronary artery disease (also referred to as a coronary heart disease) are three: chest pain (heart attack), heart attack, and heart failure.
Other symptoms may include angina and high breathlessness.
“The chocolate contains nutrients that are good for the heart, such as flavonoid, methylxanthine, polyphenol, and steric acid, which can reduce inflammation and increase good cholesterol”
Good cholesterol, also called high-density fat protein, collects “bad” cholesterol — a type of cholesterol that penetrates the arteries of the heart — and transports it into the liver.
“The bad cholesterol (low-density fat protein) is broken down into the liver and then it is separated from the body.
However, the new study does not examine the dosages or type of chocolate consumed.
It is not clear whether participants ate dark chocolate, milk chocolate or other chocolate.
The results were based on an older study that concluded that consumption of cocoa (which is found in chocolate) reduced the risk of heart attack.
Scientists believe that flavonoids found in chocolate lower blood pressure and improve vascular function.
With blood vessels, it means how well the blood distributes oxygen and nutrients around the body and removes waste materials.
Lifestyle factors could not be found in the results of the new study.
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein said about the data that those who had admitted to eating chocolate were more likely to have a healthy body weight.
She added that they could regularly exercise and feel less stress.
“Every of these factors could have an independent effect on the health of the cardiovascular system,” she added.
Coles replaces plastic toys for books in a new collection story campaign
“We’ve really listened and there was a key point in preparing a project,” Ronson said.
“We don’t believe that people want to recycle the books — we think they will want them, but they can be recovered at home if they want to.
Ronson said the new campaign has been working long before COVID-19 came to the story and, despite the passage, she believes that the timing of the new campaign has been “a lot of good — because of the amount of time parents are now defending with their children.
Reporters have expressed concern that consumers have become tired of the constant toy collection campaigns of the largest supermarkets, but Ronson says no signs of fatigue are still being seen.
“We haven’t seen anything like this yet, but we keep our eyes open for this,” she said.
“We record a lot of data, from week to week, month to month, to make sure that what we leave from our customers is consistent with our customers.
It was Cloes who rode the path for collection campaigns such as Little Shop in Australia, but the first one about my year 2018 was the driving force behind the best annual sales of the supermarket from the beginning.
Woolworths followed with Lion King Oosheis, who also helped the supermarket to expand its sales, and now the most environmentally friendly promotional campaign Discovery Garden customers offer free herbs and flowers for planting.
However, the new fundraising campaign could have less impact this time as UBS providers predict increased sales in large markets in Australia on the largest part of the financial year 2021.
Ronson said customers can expect a wide range of fundraising campaigns in the future and that campaigns such as Little Shop will be all the more likely.
“There’s a lot of fundraising campaigns around the world we’re looking at and we are constantly taking inspiration from other countries,” she said.
“We need to do this to ensure that we are making more and more of our customers.
5 laps around the country this summer
The photographer and material producer Jón Ragnar Jónsson, often known as Jon From Iceland, has been more and less aware of a fleet of Iceland since the end of the world.
Jón completed a graduate degree in Business Studies at the University of Reykjavik a few years ago but is now working on traveling and producing marketing materials for individuals and companies.
The summer began early at Jóni, or in April, when he travelled all the Westfjords and stayed in his car.
For what is a year, he has gone about five or six circles around the country.
In addition, he has gone on countless day trips here and there.
What was the trip?
“For someone like me who’s always on a beach and has seen everything, it’s hard to mention a favorite place.
It’s more weather and the community that matters.
I’ve been going to a lot of high ground since the roads opened in June.
The journeys are always up because it’s so much adventure to get to the destination.
The last trip there is a possible favorite trip of the year, and then we went 25 together on 5 big cars up by Fljótshlíd and from there to Álftastvagn.
What’s ahead of you this summer?
“It’s very exciting for me soon, but I was finishing a diving course with DIVE and now taking diving tours here and there in Iceland.
Then I was adding a surfboard to the \"destroyal court\" so I’ll be more out in the sea than before.
I’m going on a 10-day solo trip with everything I need, but it’ll be clear later in summer where I’m going.
Otherwise, I’ll be in a lot of high ground next year because it can’t be seen all year round.
What is your favorite place in Iceland?
“I always find it difficult to choose a place, but I have been a part of my life since I remember.
The family and I went every summer to live at the foot of the Breiðamarksjökull, and since then I have always felt good in that area.
I think it's safe to say I've been there over 100 times.
What places in Iceland do you recommend to visit?
“I’m going to bring one pearl from every part of the country, but there are: Mulagiel in the South, Stálaglagil in the East, Aldynafoss in the North, Redasander in the Westfjords, Snæfellsjökull in the West, and last but not last...
What is essential in the journey?
“I’m not going out to land unless I have the following in the car: a good flashlight, a hammock, a lopapeys, a hunting knife, amber cubes, a cold box and ape bites... those who know me know what I’m talking about...
Search 24 rowers who are afraid of drowning from an island in Malaysia
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Malaysian authorities said on Sunday that the search was for 25 rowers who are afraid to have drowned after jumping off a boat before Langkawi, a tourist island in northern Malaysia.
Zawawi Abdullah, senior official of Malaysian Coast Guard, said the first information the police showed that only one of the rowers 25 who had dropped off the boat had been able to swim to land.
The man who survived sought help from the police late on Saturday and has been detained while the matter is being investigated further, according to Zawawi.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslims have fled Myanmar because of military operations and many of them live in crowded refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Muslims are the majority of Malaysian inhabitants, who have been a time of a boating party that promises refugees a better life in another country.
Zawawi said two ships and aircraft were used for the search.
He said that the Coast Guard also remembers the seamen in the area and the authorities in the neighbouring country of Thailand so that they can help with the search.
He did not provide any further information about the boat.
In the last month, the Malaysian authorities captured 269 rowers in custody and found a body on board a ship suspected of being used for smuggling from the Langkawi coast, but they asked him to have been damaged intentionally so that he could not return to sea.
The Malaysian patrol later said that the 269 people had been taken from a larger ship with dozens of people believed to have died and that their bodies were thrown into the sea.
Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said Malaysia could not accept any more rowing refugees as it fights economically due to the crown virus epidemic.
He said that those who are already in the country would not be sent back to sea.
In Malaysia, more than 2 million illegal immigrants, as well as 180,000 refugees and asylum seekers, including 101,000 rowers, are registered with the United Nations refugee agency.
Residents of Aswan collect, guard and return a cargo of chocolate to Sudan by car roll
The transfer vehicle on its way to Sudan with many tons of chocolate selected on the international road between Aswan and Abu Simple on Sunday, at the street convention of the village of Wadi Karkar, when the driver died from a heat stroke.
The townspeople flocked to help the driver where he lay and save the item that had been destroyed.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, declared his position so that the driver was “waying through our village; we couldn’t just stand.
We need to help people in need, no matter where they come from.
He added that villagers had arrived on an ambulance to pick up the driver and then tried to save the transport car, which is estimated at £3 million.
Bahr said the villagers have been on the scene from morning to evening and saved as much of the cargo as they could.
“What we thought was most important was to save the driver’s life, protect the farm and open the international road again,” he said.
The villagers were willing to provide the injured driver with water and shelter, Bahr said, adding that they just wanted to ensure that he would get to and from the village safely.
There were already a breakaways in the Senate. The Korean virus could make them worse.
“The global epidemic alone is a call to our elected representative for the leadership and vision we have in difficult times,” says a report prepared from a series of interviews held by Leonard Steinhorn, a professor of communication studies at American University, and Mark Sobol, the author and expert in organizational development and management.
“But we are also facing other debt terms that revolve around the genetic sin of our nation and the racial inequality that has plagued our country from its establishment,
The study reviews familiar topics in relation to the sensitive state of the Parliament: lack of real relations between categories, agenda that limits opportunities for communication, excessive integration of power in leadership positions, constant financial requirements, statements of inter-class collaboration, negative effects of media operating throughout the 24 hours, the fact that the most important elections for Senators are often foreclosures and the final silence of minority groups.
It is also warned that the Congress will move more to the online world because of the pandemic where such a system, which allows elections with the help of local representatives in the Chamber of Representatives without the Congress having to travel to Washington, could still increase the problems that exist.
If the idea of non-disclosure is closer to a foothold, it would be a serious setback for experiments to increase inter-class communication, as said in the report.
“The global epidemic was forced by the Congress to transfer most of its activities to the Internet and we certainly understand why,” the report says.
“But despite the fact that it was necessary, it should not be interpreted as virtue.
The document states that the Congress needs “more than less communication between the Senators, face to face.”
They need to explore each other’s areas better, have courteous conversations to find common ground and build a relationship based on trust that can lead to increased understanding and solutions,
The call for politeness was especially true this week, when Ted Yoho, the Republican Senator of Florida, attacked Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democratic Senator of New York City with his actions and his colleagues in the Republican Party agreed to attack Liz Cheney, the Republican Senator in Wyoming with hostile words.
Senator Val Demings discusses the vice-president's office, allowing Trump to hear it for graces
The daughter of Val Demings (democrats, Florida) was not ashamed to discuss his interest in serving Vice President Joe Biden and sincerely thanked him for being appointed to the office.
This respected member of the parliament group of the blues was interviewed with BlackPressUSA in a live broadcast because of the #FIYAH! Live episode and told about its history, energy and commitment that has brought her to the place she is today, and began with the words \"You know all my history. I grew up as a daughter of a workwoman and housekeeper in Jacksonville, Florida.\"
Demings was one of the four prosecutors of the House of Representatives in the trial of Donald Trump in the Senate in January.
Regardless of whether the Senate is guilty of Trump, it will be recorded in the story that he is the fourth president to be charged.
In an interview with the NPR of its office with Capitol Hill, the former prosecutor of the House of Representatives said: “Is this worth it? This has been worth every single day...
She added that despite the fact that the ruling had been disappointing, Democrats had been obliged to follow the case independently.
In the interview, Deming made clear that she is opposed to Trump in Rogers Stone's prison sentence, which was convicted of lying before the Congress (accumulating other crimes) as well as his acquisition of otherfenders convicted of similar crimes, saying, \"The lack of mercy on your friends, who have lied and cheated to cover up your iniquities.\"
Deanings is at the top of Joe Biden's list of potential deputy presidents, who also contains Karen Bass chairman of the CBC (democrats, California), Stacey Abram's former governor of Georgia, Senators Kamalu Harris (democrats, California) and Tammy Duckworth (democrats, Illinois), Keisha Lance Bottoms mayor Atlanta, Susan Rice former ambassador to the United States and several others.
However, she stated that only one person would decide who offered Joe Biden this autumn.
“It’s Joe Biden.
Then she brought her hand to her mouth while she laughed and thought he was whispering to those who were watching the direct broadcast, and added, “If you want to call, you can do it for me.”
There is no doubt that regardless of political views, in historical books, this period will be considered the time when the development of American politics and attitudes took place.
It didn't happen to Demings.
She recalled that the number of women to be eligible for an offer to the Vice President of the United States is an opportunity to break through what remains of “the roof of the glass,” especially for women of African origin.
“It’s exactly this opportunity that I work so hard for all my life to create for young boys and girls who have heard that their colors are wrong, that they don’t have enough money or that they are of the wrong sex,” she said.
The Senator intended to ensure that the Democratic Party Committee and the Democratic Party's election team Biden would advertise and work with the Black Press of America to get as many to vote as possible.
“I’ll call Tom Perez (President of the Democratic Party) and I’ll put this on top of my list,” Demings said.
She agreed that this would have to happen now rather than later in the election.
When she responded to the words of former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton that Trump could refuse to leave the White House, he lost the elections, and another editorial article saying that the president is preparing to accept himself lived by Demings: “As much as he steps up to accept himself would make me feel dismay,
“Who would ever do it other than Trump?
I think he hates this job.
It should not be possible to get away with breaking the law and ignoring the Constitution in this work.
I think he hates the job, but he doesn’t like to lose.
I can absolutely believe that the president will not want to leave the White House, but we have our ways to take care of it, and if that happens, I just want to be with those who make it happen.

Alibaba and Jack Ma are entitled to Gurugram because of their dear former employee
Gurugram, July 26: The company Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma, have been directed to the court in Gurugram after the company’s former employee claimed that he had been fired for protesting editorial and false news in the programs of the company.
The case is addressed in the Gurugram District and the Sonia Sheokand private court has issued a policy for Alibaba, Jack Ma and more than 10 others and asked them to come to court on July 29, according to news.
The judge has also requested written answers from the company, according to Reuters.
Parmar, who worked at the UC Web office in Gurugram until October 2017, takes place at the 268,000 Bandarija Valley in damages according to court records.
“We are committed to the internal market and the well-being of its employees, and its policies are in accordance with applicable law.
“We can’t talk about the current process,” said UC India in a statement.
“The law also finds the “list of sensitive words — which contain passwords in Hindi and English such as “the border of India and China — and the war between China and India — which is stated in the statement that UC Web is using to study material on its systems in India,” Reuters said.
Last month, the Ministry of Internal Affairs banned 59 Chinese mobile applications, including UC News and UC Browser, in line with increased tension between the two countries.
The New York City Fire Department’s official says that “fully — it’s okay to separate a white firefighter from the award of honor.
A New York City firefighter said it was “all right to keep white firefighters from honors so that flagbers can all be black, according to new news.
White firefighter Daniel McWilliams has filed a case of racial discrimination after he was taken from a group of flagbers with a memorial in November 2017 to commemorate the fallen members of the Vulcan Society, who are the brotherhood of black firefighters.
The chief representative of the Fire Department in the field of diversity and accessibility, lawyer Cecilia Loping, also defended the decision in the hearing of the New York State Department of Human Rights.
McWilliams is one of the three firefighters in the department who, in a historical image, is seen lifting the U.S. flag at Ground Zero in the days of the September 11 attacks.
According to McWilliam's dear friend, the Fire Department had chosen him to be one of the flagbers in honor of the memorial ceremony.
Being a flagber at this ceremony was “a great honour and privilege” for McWilliams, according to CNN.
When he arrived at the ceremony, however, he was intended to take part in the award of the then President of the Vulcan Society, Regina Wilson, for it is affirmed that she had requested that all flagbers with the Mass be black.
She then asked McWilliams — a 29-year-old firefighter of New York City — to help in another way —
Among other things, she claims to have asked him to do so is to provide unspoilt citizens with escorts and set up distinctive firefighters up from the mess.
McWilliams said in his lawsuit that he asked Wilson if she was taking him out of honor because he was not black.
She confirmed that it was so, he said.
Wilson, who has worked at the New York City Fire Department for 21 years and who also participated in the rescue work on 11 September, will have replaced McWilliams for one of the Vulcan company's members.
McWilliams claims that he left the memorial ceremony “to save himself from further shame, humiliation, and shame,” says the New York Daily News.
When Lodging, who is black, bore witness in court, McWilliam’s lawyer Keith Sullivan asked her: “So to pray for everyone to be black in honor is not a difference.”
“No, it’s not,” said Love, according to the New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Loved if it was okay to ask for everyone to be black in honor, which she answered: “Very well,
Loving explained that it was okay to replace a white person with a black person to “lift up our specialty and different origins to create pride, unity, and support each other for each other.”
McWilliams first filed a complaint on discrimination based on the New York City Fire Department in January 2018.
He then filed a lawsuit against Wilson, firing New York City, New York City, and unnamed individuals in May 2019.
Sullivan said that after McWilliam's presentation, Wilson's supporters had avenged him and threatened him.
At one point, one of her supporters will have laid hands on McWilliams and said, \"I've heard of you, they told me you'd behave like this, and now you know who I am...
In his discharge, Sullivan wrote that it had been “worshipable — to exclude McWilliams from the honour of the Mass and signs that one would not be valid for everyone in the fire department.
“If you’re a black person and different from a white person in the workplace, you’ll get the most reminder,” Sullivan said.
Wilson received a lawyer’s advice for an hour, due to her treatment for McWilliams.
Meanwhile, a white person who differentiates a black person is “harmful punishment,” Sullivan wrote.
“The New York City Brotherhood has created a policy and process that is intended to please the members of the Vulcan Society, who behave in a racist manner, apologize for their actions and help them ... and this needs to stop,” Sullivan wrote.

Thousands of Khabarovsk inhabitants still demand the resignation of Putin
Thousands of citizens joined the Russian city of Khabarovsk yesterday and protested the arrest of the governor of the council of the region in the region of the East Russian region and the insertion of his successor, who has never lived in the province.
The former governor, Sergei Furgal, enjoys a huge popularity and tens of thousands of citizens protested when he was arrested and transferred to custody in Moscow earlier this month, accused of having ordered the murder in three merchants fifteen years ago.
In the past week, Furgal was formally appointed as governor and his 39-year-old brother Mikhail Degtyarev, appointed in his place, with a small crush on the locals.
Is Degtaryev said unexplored and, worse, without any connection with Khabarovsk and called the inhabitants after his resignation soon.
They called Degtaryev to be the wind of the ears.
The protesters yesterday were small fewer than in the first protests, or fifteen to twenty thousand, and the demands were the same as before: the salvation of Furgal and the resignation of Vladimir Putin, Russian President.
“We want the governor to be released, because we think his arrests are very likely to be illegal,” the AFP news agency said after a half-tributive protester, Alina Slepova.
She claims that the Kremlins have been arrested by Furgal to protect their own interests, but not the interests of the province.
The police in Khabarovsk left protesters unharmed despite the fact that the claim was without a clear violation of the applicable agreement because of the Korona virus epidemic.
In Moscow, however, the police arrested at least ten people who came together in Pushkin Square to show protesters in Khabarovsk support in action, says the British newspaper Guardian.
The category of Furgals, the free-standing Democratic Party of Russia, is a party of hard-line nationalists, and is considered by policy-makers to be quite loyal to the Kremlin government in most cases.
The same policymakers, however, informed the BBC that the victory of Furgals in the provincial governor's elections two years ago — which was great and undisturbed — had been a considerable shock for Putin and United Russia, and although the fighting of the Kremlin in the East was weakening.
Furgal was arrested on 9 July and moved to Moscow where he was waiting for trial.
He is charged with ordering three murders in 2004 and 2005.
There were two of them, but the third went out.
Sarah Rainsford, BBC reporter in Moscow, said followers of Furgals, who enjoy popular homes, convinced that the prosecution and the arrest have political roots.
They want to know why the government has been waiting for him to be arrested until now, says Rainsford, 15 years after his intentional breakup.

Homeless women with disabilities take part in the fight against COVID-19 in Chennai
Shanthi, a disabled woman who is trained as a dresser, visits 250 homes every day to identify people with characteristics in Kodambakkam, much Covid infection area in Chennai, where there are reported to have about 10,000 cases.
Workday starts early at 7:30, and ends at 16 pm.
It measures the heat of the inhabitants, asks about the characteristics, and teaches them about the importance of using masks, washing their hands regularly, and keeping away from others.
Its work has even led to the diagnosis and treatment of infection during the course of four positive individuals.
Shanthi is one of 16,000 Chennai citizens who do their homework but are not health professionals.
The project has, according to authorities, contributed to the reduction of positive cases by 50 percent, in the daily count of Chennai, while increasing in other regions of Tamil Nadu.
Shanthi says that not all of the inhabitants are collaborators.
She adds: “Most people are collaborating when a woman with disabilities approaches them.
Some, however, get annoyed.
This is not to worry about.
I think people should be safe.
When I return the next day, people are courteous.
It helps to build a good relationship.
And there are more women like Shanthi who stay in the gistyl for women with disabilities and fight against Covid-19 team.
Not far from Kodambakkam, Kavitha, who also has a disability, has also participated in the effort as a supervisor.
Even though Kavitha has a custom-made bike, she begins to meet people and keep on her heels.
“I’m happy, she says about the reduction of infection, but she adds: “I want to see them go down to maybe about 100 a day.
I'm sure we can get it.
On the first floor of the gistyli where the two live, Matilda Funceca, a basketball woman who uses a wheelchair, and Manimekalai who is a teacher, and they send all the data that comes from about 40 women into Chennai’s server.
Matilda says she is not afraid to get infected by the coronavirus.
\"When we help others, God protects us,\" he added.
When asked what measures she is taking, Manimekalai says: “I use a mask, hold away, and wash my hands often.
I also drink Kabasura Kudineer, Siddha drink that promotes the immune system.
A few months ago, when the crown virus first arrived in Chennai, these disabled women spent their time and abilities in sewing masks for health professionals in the city.
Aishwarya Rao’s doctor and director of the gistyli, as well as the Dorcas research center that operates the cloud team, says: “They adapt to the needs of each moment.
They used to need a mask, and then they didn’t leave.
Now they’ve got an intervention in the community, and then they’ve responded to the call.
Human virus infection in Tamil Nadu is now 200,000 after 6989 new cases over the last 24 hours, but there is also the highest number of infections detected in one day, according to official data.
Eighty-nine have died and 7758 have recovered in the past 24 hours.
The total number of infections in the state is now 206,737.

South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox report their experience of discrimination
Over the past few weeks, it has become clear that many skeletons are still in the closet in connection with racial discrimination in sports in South Africa.
Building conversations need to take place and take action so that everyone is welcome in sports.
Ashwell Prince, the former cricket star of Proteas, allowed his white former teammates to hear it and accused them of racial prejudice by telling him and other black teams to be “choot players”
Prince said black players Proteas have been officially named “choot players” by their white teammates.
He added that it would be sad that even though black players such as Makhaya Ntini and now Køsso Rabada had the highest score in the sport, some people still associated with the debate.
Prince, now the coach of the Cape Cobras team, allowed this review to be made at the United Coalition for Sport and Community Based Organizations (UCSCBO) on Thursday night.
The goal of the agreement is to continue the fire-fired discussion of historical racial discrimination in South African sports.
“Like I said when I eased myself on social media, it’s not my intention to come and bring people’s names down to the ground, but these are real events...

Paul Roberts, a former musician and engineer who became a NASA programmer, is now working with a software company.
He and his wife, a former Methodist hospital nurse who sees himself as an optimist, held an outdoor magazine online and attended Comic Con events earlier in years.
Once a week, they push with their two daughters, son-in-law, and seven-year-old grandchild and play an energetic Uno game.
\"They're amazing nerds,\" says Roman, 38 years old, about his parents.
Sheryl Roberts, aged 65, is aware of the dangers of the pandemic — she has diabetes, asthma, and heart disease that can put her at increased risk.
Her husband has a chronic lung disease and a supporting member that keeps the previously blocked coronary artery open.
“We’ve been so careful, very careful, and stay away from people,” said Sheryl Roberts.
Her husband started working from home this spring, when the road fought hard in Washington, New York, and other areas around the country.
Paul has occasionally gone to a supermarket at “old times,” and their only real dating last month was to tell Sheryl when they started to look at wildflowers through the car window.
Their younger daughter was also cautious.
But then she came home from work one day in mid-June and thought she was allergic.
She quickly suffered cough, fever, headache and diarrhoea, and lost all taste and smell, which are typical characteristics of the coronavirus.
“She said, “I don’t know what’s going on, Mom, but I had a mask, had gloves, washed my hands,” Sheryl said.
“You’re doing everything right, but you’re still getting infected.
Elaine Roberts, diagnosed with positive coronavirus infection, did not become seriously ill.
The situation got worse with her parents.
Paul Roberts and his wife started to kneel and then cough, just like their daughter, and then got so hot and great a pain in the body.
He then became “very sick, very quickly,” said Sheryl Roberts.
On June 22, he was confused.
She was worried about his oxygen level.
It was low and she asked their older daughter to take him to an emergency for the second time in two days.
The former royal couple thought it was \"shen\", in the Queen's Christmas speech, according to a new book
MEGHAN Markle and Harry the British Prince found his mother, the British Queen, to “reveal them in their Christmas speech.
The new story of the couple, \"Finding Freedom,\" states that they were found looking forward to those in the museum who could see in the Christmas speech.
Pictures on the desk with which the Queen sat showed, among other things, Vilhálm, Prince of Britain, Kate Middleton, and their three children, Prince Charles of Britain, and his wife Kamillu as well as Prince Philip.
However, Meghan and Harry were nowhere to be seen despite the fact that Archie had been born in May, yet the boy was referred to as “the boy of the child of the child of the child of her own.
The new book, published in August, also states that Meghan and Kate Middleton “were never friends, since they “had difficulty overcoming superficial politeness —and met only a few times.
Yesterday, it was stated that Harry and his brother Vilhálm had begun a few years before his relationship with Meghan, but that it has reached the peak due to the marriage of William and Kate Middleton.
The Duke of Sussex felt that he was a “varieval” at events with his brother and Kate Middleton, and that’s why he said that “he wanted to change things long before Meghan came to history.”
The members of the Conservative Party are accused of working leaders wanting to keep public employees “home forever.”
The members of the Conservative Party charge workers that they want public employees to be “home forever” after the leaders protested Boris Johnson’s call for people to return to work.
Workers were accused of wanting to “go home forever” after they objected to Boris Johnson’s call to people to return to work.
The members of the Conservative Party were angry when the union of public and public employees told their members to ask their feet when their officers ordered them to return to their workplaces.
Andrew Percy, the former minister, said that “unacceptable — that necessary public service such as the version of passports would be stopped while staff in the public market had been working hard to keep the community running in the corona virus epidemic.
“It is unacceptable that people refuse to return to their jobs while employees in warehouses and factories throughout the country have continued to work so that public employees can eat while this has been going on,” he said.
“Many of these employees now want to go to summer vacation but can’t because of the people who refuse to go back to their workplaces, even if it’s safe.
Workers cannot maintain this policy to stay at home forever - especially now that we know people can return to work safely -
Following the call by the Prime Minister last week, Alex Chisholm, the newly appointed head of public service, announced that the Ministry of Public Service “returns from working at home, and accelerates their return to their workplaces until 1 August”
The company of public and public employees told its members, who consider about 200,000 people, that they did not need to comply with this requirement, and said this was about politics.
A spokesperson of the public and public workers, the largest working party in the UK, said the demand to return to the workplace was “not put forward with the health and safety of our members in the forefront, or to strengthen the economy.
This is done solely because of political pressure from the Members of the Conservative Party who demand that public service be used as an example to get others back to work.
Our advice to the members is clear: If you do your job at home and someone in your department asks you to return to the workplace, do not take what of course you need to do so.
The division is due to growing dissatisfaction with the late release of passports because staff work at home, but some 400,000 people are now said to be waiting for their applications.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has now stated that it will “seek to speed up — applications from the UK for travel in the next two weeks, and from those who have been waiting for a passport release for more than four weeks.
Public and public employees’ unions have acknowledged that some had to wait up to 143 days after passports, but they argue that “small and often narrow offices — make 4,000 staff of the passport service difficult to keep more distant.
The government’s former minister, David Davis, urged the leaders of the union to “be wise and seek a way to cooperate with the government to bring people back into their workplaces.
He added that if he was in the government, he would ask a police officer: “What do you want? People will be home all summer...
However, many of the UK’s largest companies have also ignored Johnson’s recommendation to return to work.
A study in larger workplaces with a total of 400,000 employees revealed that only about 40,000 of them have returned to their workplaces.
Focusing on history can play an important role in harmony.
It has grown, but understanding and reconciliation should be the goal.
The school system is part of this lack of knowledge and understanding.
Too little is learned from Australian history.
The fact is that without radical action, the only teaching article that deals specifically with our history will die out within the next five years or even earlier.
Last year, only 628 students in Victoria completed a study in the history of Australia of a total of 49,324 who completed primary education, or just 1%.
Over the past six years, this number has almost decreased by half, while nearly 100 fewer students have enrolled in the class every year.
The main reason why so few students choose to learn about Australia’s history in the 12th grade is that little has been done in previous years of study to interest them.
History is not even a unique field of study, but it falls under the wider “science”
Therefore, students in the 7th and 8th grades complete only one short unit of ‘free residences and island houses in the Torres Strait and their culture,
In the 9th and 10th years, there is a second unit in Australia in the World War.
For many students in Victoria, this is all that is taught about the history of Australia during the elementary school years.
In the 9th and 10th years, the second optional unit is between 1750-1918.
It is important to take three steps to save Australian history in Victoria’s schools.
First of all, history must become an independent study article like English, mathematics, and science.
As a story is only known as part of the mindset, it has little place in the curriculum.
It is usually taught by people who have general education in the field of science but have not educated themselves in history.
Historical skills such as analysis of information are complex.
We need to hire more specialized historians to ensure that such skills are perceived in an accessible and exciting way.
Third, the history of Australia from 1788 to 1914 will become mandatory.
Students can appreciate what they know.
So many of my former students chose not to learn the history of Australia in the 12th grade because they would have to learn the material from scratch.
Knowledge of the story alone and sees bridges not deep interracial.
But without her, as can be seen clearly in the Viktorian program, the project is hopeless.

Aron Elís in the European seat final - Isaac divided by field in half
Aaron Elís Hänndarson has played a European seat in the Danish Premier League.
Isaac Bergmann Johannesson played only the first half with the Norrköping team against the Falkenberg base team in Sweden.
Aron Elís was on the OB team in Denmark when the team continued to play the final stage in the European Championship.
OB will meet AGF or FC Köbenhavn in the final game, but it depends on whether the teams will end up above the final round of the top part of the Danish selection department later today.
Aaron Elias played the entire game in a 1-1 draw with Horsens in the field today, but OB had won the first game of the teams at home, 3-1 and therefore won a total of 4-2.
Isaac was in the early part of Norrköping, who was unexpectedly 2-0 below after the first half-game against Falkenberg in the Swedish Premier League.
Norrköping made a triple split at the beginning of the second half and was Isaac one of those who had to fold.
Norrköping was rated equal to Falkenberg reached 3-2 in the 89th minute.
However, it was time for Norrköping to recover from video at the last hour, 3-3.
Norrköping is still on top, with 24 points, four points ahead of Elfsborg and five points ahead of Malmö who are playing for good later today.
The stage served Falkenberg to get off the bottom for a while, but the team is a level above Helsingborg and Kalmar who owns a game for good.
Collecting Stories of National Celebration in Korón Virus Times
Anna Lilja Sigurðardóttir founded the Facebook group “My 2020 Festival” to collect sources of the national festival that the Germans will hold for the next weekend.
Many will camp in their gardens and rejoice with friends and relatives.
Anna Lilja talked with Hvita on the show Helgen on the Bøll.
“There’s nothing in there that’s very exciting too because there are 600 people in the group so people are going to do something clearly,” says Anna Lilja.
There is something wrong with the islanders going to have a tent party at home.
“People have talked about being with their own [fest], maybe camping in the garden and coughing up the family as they always do at that time,” says Anna.
“You expect people to spend time with their people.
It is likely that many people will not be in the area, but still have some little celebration somewhere else.
The National Celebration Committee is currently working hard to repay the tickets purchased, but Anna thinks many locals are going to rather secure tickets for the next year’s celebration.
“People are even investing in the tickets now and are valid for 2021.
“I’m a great German man, I love the preparation and all around it, but sometimes something comes into life that you don’t control, and that’s just how it is,” Anna says, but it’s been said that people have something to say about whether they can’t let go of the festival.”
Anna Lilja claims that she has not formed the group for herself or to encourage people to hold their own national celebrations, but to collect the records of World Trade Fairs this year.
“What did people do in these strange times?
I'm not going to use this in one thing or anything, but then someone who uses such sources in something, but I was just creating a place where people can put in what they're doing.
There is also a fire on the Fjóskelett, which is on fire every year.
“I think many people are excited to get burned on Friday night.
The only thing that makes a mark in the account is that the forecast is not a special thing.
“It’s going to be on fire, but it’s just going to show you what it’s going to be like,” says Anna Lilja.

Will Prince Andrés be mentioned in a new case about sexual abuse?
The British royal family is now preparing to respond to potential new information in court documents about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
U.S. judge has ordered secret documents about Epstein and Maxwell to be made public
Among other things found in these 80 pages of documents are parts with the testimony of Maxwell from 2016
Offering these pages could also put a lot of pressure on Prince Andrés where they are finding communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015
In 2015, Virginia Roberts, who was supposed to be a sex critic, stated in court that she had been forced to engage with Prince Andrés.
Prince Andrés is now preparing to defend himself from the possible publication of information this week with even more harmful accusations of his friendship with child addict Jeffrey Epstein and his supposed scientist, Ghislaine Maxwell.
U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska arranged this week for the publication of 80 secret legal documents in connection with Maxwell and Epstein, which count hundreds of pages.
The delivery of these huge documents would be a shock for the 58-year-old Maxwell, where they have to store a large portion of her testimony before lawyers in 2016, including what her lawyers have said to be “excellent questions” about her sex story.
They could also put a great deal of pressure on Prince Andrés, where one of the documents contains communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts intended the sex trial of the defamatory American Treasurer, in 2015 stated in court that she had three times been forced to engage with Andrés.
Andrés has repeatedly rejected these statements.
A 2015 email that has been leaked and the BBC published last year seems to suggest that Andrés has asked Maxwell for help in responding to Robert's statements.
We have no doubt that the Duke will be revolted.
He said, “Let me know when we can talk. There are some questions I need to ask you about Virginia Roberts.
Maxwell replied, “I have information. Call me when you have a free time.
One historian who is close to Andrew said: “The Duke of Jórvík has done nothing wrong, and that’s why we don’t worry about opening a court case.
As the U.S. courts have tried to point out, this does not mean that the charge is true even if it is in court.
The U.S. courts have encouraged the media and the public to take care of the fullest care in the treatment of the allegations that appear in court records.
We totally agree with that.
We have no doubt that the Duke will be in full rebellion in the next few weeks.
Maxwell is now in detention in Manhattan detention center waiting for trial for finding and seizing some of Epstein's victims who were under legal age from 1994 to 1997.
She is also accused of injuring her for denying the knowledge of a report on his abuse.
She rejects all charges.
Maxwell last spoke to lawyers in April and July 2016 in connection with Roberts' injury chief, who is now under the surname Giufre, whom she took up after marriage.
About 40 pages out of a total of 418 with that testimony were made public last year, but after the ruling of the Court of Justice of New York last week, more parts could be opened first on Thursday.
Lawyer Maxwell got one week to file a appeal.
Epstein was found dead in his New York prison room last year when he was tried for sexual assault.
Investigators are looking for a crime attack on the streets of Edinburgh
Three assaulted a man in Edinburgh and caused him to suffer injuries that could prove permanent.
The victim, 29 years old, was attacked on Drum Street, Gilmerton, between 23:00 and 23:30 on Saturday.
The Scottish police reported that he had been transferred to the Royal Hospital with serious injuries.
The investigator Dale Miles, who is in charge of the investigation, said: “It was a violent and pointless attack.
The suspect fled to Newtoft Street.
One of them was thought to be in the early 30's, about 180 cm in height and strongly grown.
He was short-cut and dark-haired in white shirt, dark pants, and dark shoes.
Miles said, “I ask everyone in this area when the attack was made and saw something suspicious about giving up.”
The ambassador wants to carry a gun in Iceland
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, U.S. ambassador to Iceland, wants to carry a gun on this land and wants to increase security.
He was said to have been “friendly” about his safety since he arrived in the country last year.
This is revealed in CBS’s news, which also says that Gunter, despite working in the “one of the safest states in the world,
Gunter is said to have asked the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs to hide from the Icelandic government that he may bear a gun.
He then asked for a armored car and a vest to protect him from knife stabs.
CBS officials say the Ministry has repeatedly informed Gunter that he is not at risk in Iceland.
According to CBS, Iceland's foreign ministry has not provided any information as to whether the request has been received from the United States regarding the possible ceasefire of Gunter, because the authorities do not express themselves on the security measures of foreign accounts.
Journalists say that no request was made.
Then CBS also has it after his sources have been told that he should not seek to bear arms, because it would be taken as an insult here in the country.
Gunter is an inexperienced man who has been a dermatologist for years in California.
He is active in the Republican Party of the United States and a proponent of President Donald Trump.
He raised the recent attention of this country when he was looking for the “invisible China virus.”
CBS officials also say that Gunter was seriously downplayed by the U.S. Embassy in Reykjavík.
He already had seven second-level employees in the embassy from May last year.
He has, among other things, accused them of belonging to the “Deep Kingdom,” known as being a network of U.S. officials working against Trump, and insurgencyed that one carried snow into his office.
The ambassador traveled to Washington DC in February for a conference and refused to return to Iceland for a few months, according to CBS sources.
Gunter is said to have wanted to work from California, but eventually Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, had to command him to return and did so in May.
The home game form is key to Jose Mourinho, which says Tottenham has easier games in advance when fans get to meet again at play
With Jose Mourinho's help, Tottenham Hotspur has not lost a game at home since the selection department started again, but he says that it would be much easier to keep a good walk at home if the audience were allowed to play.
Spurs has won 12 wins at home in this season, but lost four times - only one of the six teams that are above them has lost more at home.
The coach Portuguese said that although such a victory could be possible without the fans, it would be easier to maintain it if they were in place.
“We have to do this with the fans. Without them you can build some kind of activity, where the game program is in the foreground,” he said.
“But I think it would be much more powerful to do so with fans, because it will be added to the emotional side of the game, which only next with the help of fans at the home stadium.
Mourinho believes that with stronger competitors, it will be increasingly difficult to maintain the long-term victories at home that he knows from Chelsea, or that Liverpool has built up the past three seasons.
But this is also a key factor in determining whether the teams reach their goals at the end of the period, especially in the equations of games and neighbouring laws, where the atmosphere of the field can divide the creations.
“I think the direction in the selection department is that now it’s becoming increasingly difficult to beat this unfavorable record because of what has become good.
“In addition, it’s important to be strong at home and at the end of the season have loaded in a number of points with wins in home games.
“I’m happy with the results from home games recently, without fans, but we need to get them back.
I see victory against Arsenal with the field full of Tottenham fans.
It’s a feeling that’s built up a little bit.
Buyers excited for sought after lifestyles in Lovely Banks
“Greater is better — is clearly the motto of new owners of huge property in the neighborhood of Lovely Banks, which was sold recently on $1270.
Interested buyers in the search for a lifestyle near the city centre of Geelong flew to view this 1.35 hectares of land, where car shelters can be found for 14 cars, swimming pools and views of Corio-floa.
Joe Grgic, a real estate agent in Harcourts, North Geelong, said that offers in the land that the Cuddihy Court 1 had been approved within 10 days of being placed on the market.

Home Ideal for Insulation
“We got a lot of offers from different parties,” said Grigic.
“The property was sold to a homeowner who is very excited.
The property comes with a four-bedroom house on two floors, including a private bathroom large enough to accommodate a sofa.
The new owners have options for three rooms and can make use of a kitchen and updated outdoor areas with views of the swimming pool.
“It was about how the property was built, that it was three acres, and that it was in this place,” said Gric.
“Here, interested merchants came from Melbourne who wondered what the property was in the middle of the area, but still with a landscape.
“I have people who have lost and buyers who are still looking.
He said that the spacious storage area, which includes a double car shed and a freestanding cloud that holds 10-12 vehicles, was perfect for industrialists or to store caravans and trailers.
Counting Your Safety Threatened in Iceland
“Despite being appointed as the safest country in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been very keen on his safety since he arrived in Reykjavík in the past year.
This is how CBS News discusses U.S. ambassadors in Iceland, but this mimics many sources of CBS from US foreign service.
According to CBS, Gunter requested to the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs that he be granted a special license to the Icelandic government to carry firearms.
He should also have wanted a armored car, as well as ideas about the West that could protect him from knife-spining attacks.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs refused to publicly state whether Gunter’s security is actually threatened in Iceland, but according to information from officials, Gunter has been repeatedly expressed that he is not in any particular danger.
Despite this, the U.S. Embassy recently announced after lifeguards in full-time work, including in the July 18th morning newspaper, but CBS reports that it is done to keep Gunter concerned.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs does not express its views on specific security measures in relation to its embassy, but always says the objective of ensuring security by means of preventive measures.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not answer any questions concerning the request of Gunters that the armed forces and the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs do not want to state whether the United States has formally requested the ambassador to carry firearms, and does not usually say that it is a foreign agency safety issue.
CBS, however, has, according to its Icelandic sources, never submitted a request, and according to three U.S. officials, Gunter was given the floor of his plans as they could cause domestic insults in Iceland.
CBS also discusses the various issues that have been addressed to the U.S. Embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed Ambassador last year, but he will already have replaced his vice-president seven times.
Thus, the first deputy minister is said to have prepared for his work for a long time and learned Icelandic only to have been denied the position at the last hour because Gunter “did not read at him” at their first meeting.
His followers have not gone much better under Gunter's rule.
Governments within the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs are said to be aware of the position of the embassy in Iceland, but are reluctant to intervene in matters closely related to the President.
In addition to this, Gunter is said to be slow to follow the various rules of foreign service and respect the order of government.
Gunter traveled to the United States in February to participate in a conference in Washington, and has been said to have refused to return to Iceland in the wake of his time-limited place of his work for months, and that in the middle of a world-famous period.
Mr. Gunter has even wanted to do his job in remote work and said he would not return to Iceland unless the foreign minister himself, Mike Pompeo, wished for it specifically.
According to U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs, Gunter had decided to take a personal permission to the conference, and the Koreans delayed it further, but according to CBS's sources, many within the Ministry will have asked Gunter to return to Iceland, which he did not until May, as a result of Pompeo's contact with him and kindly asked him to return to the embassy in Iceland.
Also, CBS’s opposition to Gunters is reported in Iceland, especially in conjunction with thist, where he calls the Corón virus “invisible China virus — and has received a great deal of criticism.
Gunter is one of the many, almost unexplored in the field of foreign service ambassadors who have been appointed in the reign of Donald Trump U.S. President.
Sachin Pilot v. Ashok Gehlot; Bharatiya Janata Party says government crisis in the state; Congress Party wants a vote
Ashok Gehlot said that if this happened, the Congress Party would have to make a statement outside the prime minister's home.
On Saturday, the day after a peaceful protest against Raj Bhawan in Jaipur, Ashok Gehlot, Prime Minister Rajasthan, said that if this happened, Congressional Senators would need to meet the president and topic for a vote outside the prime minister's home to bring the crisis into the state to smell.
At the Congressional Conference of Congress, Gehlot suggested that a vote should be held to determine whether the majority of the members of the party and the co-armers were present with him in the power struggle.
“He said the government has a majority and wants to vote,” said Mahesh Joshi, chief congressional guard, after the meeting.
The Congressional meeting was held at a hotel where the governors who support Gehlot have stayed last days.
“The general minister asked us to be ready to stay at the hotel for longer.
If necessary, he said, he would meet the president and also hold peaceful protests outside the prime minister’s home,” said a party leader.
Rajasthan's chief minister may call the Senate together and have the Congress Party show up on its majority,\" said party leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday, and suggested that he had reached the council of the Bharatiya Janata party to overthrow the government of Ashok Gehlot of a chair.
“The country is now governed by law and constitution.
Governments are formed and are working with the people’s representatives.
Bharatiya Janata has been appointed to overthrow Rajasthan's government.
It is an insult to Rajasthan's 80 million inhabitants.
“The President-in-Office must call together for the truth to come ahead of the country,” Gandhi said in a statement in Hindi.
Ashok Gehlot, Prime Minister Rajasthan, told Congressional Congressional members on Saturday that he was prepared to go to the President of India to ensure that what he calls “the Board of Directors of Bharatiya Janata — to delay a declaration of trust by vote will not be possible.
Gehlot, who protested for many hours with the home of the governor Kalraj Mishra on Friday to press for a meeting, met with Congress Party Senators and government on Saturday and after the meeting were new proposals built and approved by government.
Mishra asked Gehlot last night to put the congressional request back in and refer to six objections.
It will soon be sent to the governor.
Gehlot has accused the governor of delaying the Congress meeting where he is “under pressure” to delay the vote that will lead to confidence in his government.
When Gehlot met with his government, the Bharatiya Janata delegation in the leadership of Satish Poonia and the head of the government of Gulab Chandra Kataria met with the governor to discuss the position of COVID-19 in the state.

Actress Spencer Grammer gave a cut outside a restaurant in Manhattan
NEW YORK - Spencer Grammar's actress said she was trying to calm the angry man when he cut her arm and put her friend in her back outside a restaurant in New York City last Friday.
Grammer, aged 36, told US Weekly that she and her friend had done what everyone else had done in the same situation as they had been trying to prevent the situation from getting worse when they were attacked.

Grim said that both her and her friend were expecting to get there quickly.
Neither of them suffered serious internal injuries, she said.
In a statement to the US Weekly, Grammer thanked those who responded to the platform and staff of the Bellevue Hospital who listened to them and recalled the “unbelievable battle — this staff of the crown virus epidemic.
“It was a great opportunity to thank them in person,” said Grammar.

I'm here to help people - Chimaev after a historic evening at UFC Fight Island - RT Sport News
Khamzat Chimaev of Russia is now named as the next star UFC after registering in the history of Fight Island, but he does not say he is aiming to flag his wealth in an overcrowded manner like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev wore Northern Irish Rhys McKee in their battles in the slump of Abú Dabi on Saturday night as he won his competition when three minutes and 9 seconds were left of the first cycle by having his hit in the floor.
The victory recorded the name of Chimaev in the UFC's history book for the shortest time between wins in the modern history of the competition, where only 10 days had passed since he defeated British John Phillips in a similar way, then in the interim.
Chimaev, who has a victory ratio of 8-0, received 50,000 Bandarijadala bonuses for the performance of the evening against McKee and has captured the attention of the MMA world so fully that he is now named \"Khalib 2.0 - which can be said to be an inexhaustible comparison because of how much resemblance there is between Chimaev and UFC champions in light failure and where he is born in Téénia, which is near home-high Khabib in Dagestan.
Despite newfound fame and financial gain, the translator Chimaev has said that he would not be keen on flagging his wealth like the MMA money machine Conor McGregor or his peers in the boxing world, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
“I’m not just doing this for myself, I’m doing this for everyone I can help.
“I don’t want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, show my money or anything like that.
\"I want to help people,\" Chimaev replied when asked about it on Fight Island how he would use the bonus.
Among other things, he has observed Conor McGregor's teammates and works Twitter-notance Dillon Danis, who wrote on the social media that he could \"easyly - defeated Chimaev by giving up.
It was not in a toxic response from the battleship that goes under the name \"Borz\" or \"wolf\" in his native language, which said that he would \"pain Danis with his eyes closed,\"
Chimaev, now living in Stockholm, Sweden after moving to the country at the age of 19, may make little progress for his financial power, but he is clearly unfavorable in flirting with his martial arts.
“I can paint anyone...
How many fighters are in the charity?
“I can hurt them all,” he said.

The Israelis continue to protest the reaction of the Prime Minister to the pandemic
JERUSALEM (AP) - Thousands of Israelis protested the Prime Minister of the country on Saturday and were the largest protests outside the official seat of Benjamin Netanyahu, Jerusalem.
The protest has lasted for a few weeks, but they started because of what critics consider the government's negligence to be responding to the crown virus epidemic after having initially succeeded in keeping the threat of the virus in place.
Netanyahu's charges of corruption have further spurred the protest.
“Bibi, go home, stand on the sign of the one of the protesters.
Another panel said, “Everybody sees that the emperor has lost his clothes.
Also, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Netanyahu beach house in the wealthy city of Caesarea.
Last week, the police used water guns to split groups in Jerusalem.
After what has been called the rapid and unorganized re-opening of the economy in May, the average number of new cases a day rose to 2000.
The country's economy has been hit due to the limitations of the virus and unemployment has increased to nearly 20%.
Opponents say the government’s financial assistance is not enough.
The protest took place in the shadow of the trial of corruption charges against Netanyahu, which resumed in the month.
Interviews will begin in January.
He is charged with fraud, fraud, and bribery in a series of scandals.
Hundreds of protesters come together in the center of Los Angeles to show agreement with protesters in Portland
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) — About 300 protesters gathered in the centre of Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon to support two-month-old movement in Portland, Oregon, where attention is focused on the FBI after fighting with protesters.
Similar protests took place throughout the United States, including Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York City.
The Los Angeles protest was organized by the Refuse Fascism and Youth Liberation Front groups.
The group went to the headquarters of the Los Angeles Police Department on First Street and Main Street, and next to the detention centre of the metropolitan area.
The participants also moved to the Alameda route on Route 101, but later abandoned it.
Part of the population saw a broken window in the city centre and false words were written on the federal markings.
At least one person was arrested in protests.
50 people in mosque at the Eid festival and no prayer meetings in Eidgah, says the government of Karnataka
The festival of Eid-ul-Azha, or Bakrid, takes place on 31 July and 1 August.
Governments in Karnataka have issued that only 50 may come together in mosques for the sake of Eid-ul-Azha, and have banned prayer meetings in Eidgah and other places for the corona virus epidemic.
Guests who want to pray for in mosque must wear masks and stay away, according to the order of AB Ibrahim, the director of the affairs of minority groups and Wakf.
The Directive states that the Hilal Committee has decided that the Eid-ul-Azha festival, also called or Bakrid, shall be held on 31 July in the province of Udupi, Dakshine Kannada and Kodada, and on 1 August elsewhere in the state.
The directive states that while prayer meetings are one of the most important sacred customs of Muslims at the Bakrid festival, such events in Eidgah and other places are prohibited by the COVID-19 epidemic.
Prayers are allowed in mosques, however, provided that no more than 50 participates at once.
If more than that, the petitions will be divided, the Board of Directors of the Directive says.
Do not hold prayer meetings anywhere else, such as meeting rooms, social centers, or “Shadi Mahal” at this point.
The Karnataka government allows temples, mosques, and other farmers to be opened to those who wish to pray for from June 8th, providing that infectious products are well kept because of COVID-19.
The U.S. Ambassador Wants a Armed Lifeguard
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, the ambassador to the United States in Iceland, considers his life a threat to the country and wants to carry weapons.
At the beginning of 2020, the U.S. Embassy repeatedly announced “bodyguard” in Icelandic newspapers and used the actual English word bodyguard in the advertisement.
According to the sources of Entress, the main reason why these jobs were announced is that the Ambassador of Jeffrey Ross Gunter believes his life is threatened in Iceland.
He has spoken to scholars in Iceland and abroad who tell the ambassador that he is in great danger and the reason is that he is of Jewish descent.
What the threat is, is not as obvious, but the respondents of Enlightenment said that Islamic terrorists had been named as a threat.
CBS's TV station discussed the issue on its website this morning and after Washington's sources that Gunter is being harassed, demands to carry his own weapons, to get punch-proof vests and armed escorts as well as bullet-proof vehicles.
According to CBS, Gunter has repeatedly been said that there is no threat and that the advertisement after “bodyguard” is only to say Gunter.
According to Logger's sources, the positions were not hired at the end of June, but the application deadline ran out in February.
According to the sources of Entress, there has been no formal investigation from the U.S. Embassy due to these changes.
There has been no formal request for increased protection or for a warrant that the lifeguards are carrying out weapons outside the embassy’s walls.
Icelandic law states that this is not permitted except by a special authority of the Governor of the State.
Enlightenment within the management system says there is no information about any kind of threat.
The most recent risk assessment by the Governor of the United States is a fairly high level of terrorism.
There are no examples of terrorism in Iceland and no evidence that terrorist or extreme groups work here.
The reasons for allowing the armament of a foreign embassy on the streets of cities and towns in Iceland are, according to the sources of Fire, not present.
Gunter drew considerable attention to the country when he shared the president of the United States and called the COVID-19-China virus.
He then had the American and Icelandic flags.
A Seattle radio broadcaster who claimed Trump's response to protests now needs to get a gun after Starbucks cafes under his apartment were destroyed — RT United States News
Paul Gallant has been given a new perspective on violent protests after he has heard that Donald Trump is the President of the United States in June for saying that anarchists are burning and hijacking Seattle City.
The only thing that had to be left near the home of the director.
“I feel like I need to buy a gun because this will obviously continue to happen,” said Gallant on Twitter on Saturday evening after seeing that the wrecks had “destroyed the Starbucks coffee shop on his bottom floor.
“It’s enough. It looks like a street party down the street from me. Very angry now.
The situation was different when Trump complained last month that Seattle Mayor Seattle was allowing violent protesters to take over the city.
“These liberal Democrats are hopeless,” the president said.
“The perpetrators burn and rob our cities, and they just feel wonderful, even death...
Gallant, co-director of the program “Danny & Gallant” at the Seattle Collaboratorial Radio Station, responded with this: “There was no fire, robbery, or death.
Gallant said last night that police had advised residents to stay away from his apartment building where explosives could be found in the damaged Starbucks cafe.
He published pictures of the damage and said: “Well done, stupid, and stated that he had also seen the fire a few houses away.
“Don’t have any idea what’s going on, but we’re going to find out.
The conversion did not pass people who claimed Gallant for his previous opinion and thistle messages such as “Just relax on salmon,” and “Yah, maybe Trump was right.”
Jason Rantz, another Seattle radio broadcaster, said, \"We're not going on this mission we've been talking about...
Gallant said to the joke: “Weary and saw that lots of people were ticking”the lax, to me.
He said he stood by his previous statement as he had gone through the CHAZ Self-Government Area of Anarchist and although it was not as bad as it had been done.
“So it was burned and robbed after all,” he said.
White Lines star Laura Haddock, 34 years old, in apartment search with his 28-year-old lover, Tom Rhys Harries
Laura Haddock and her boyfriend, Tom Rhys Harries, started together at the White Lines, which is about suck and sleet on Ibiza, but in the search for homes over the past week, their reputation was different and quieter, away from the pleasure of the party island.
The couple, who play the siblings in the Netflix series popular, was seen looking at an elegant neighborhood in Oxfordshire, which is for sale at £1.2 million.
They arrived in the Range Rover area as Laura, 34, a week, dressed in jeans and white shirts, and met there a real estate dealer who led them on a journey around the five-bedroom house.
In White Lines, which was recorded last autumn, Laura played the role of Zoe Walker, who met the darker side of Ibiza when she researches the murder of her brother, Alex, the recording wife of Tom, 28 years old.
They did not get through their relationship until this month, within a year of the end of the six-year marriage of Lauri and Sam Clavlin, but he is known from the Hunger Games films.
Together, the four-year-old son Pip and his daughter Margot, who is two years old.
When they announced the divorce last August, Clavlin, 34, wrote on Instagram: “I Laura has decided to understand divorce. We understand in love, friendship, and with deep respect for each other, and will continue our cooperation on the upbringing of our children.
Laura and Sam first met in 2011 in an audition, and Sam, who has also played in Peaky Blinders, declared their wedding in 2013 as “unfortunately one of the greatest achievements of my life.”
Before Laura got her role in the White Lines, she had played in the previous Inbetweeners film, and in the crime drama The Capture from the BBC, which was shown last year, where she played the lawyer Design Roberts.
Tom took a role in the second Inbetweeners film and in the series Brittania from Sky.
I think it's too early to say about other waves in this country.
A specialist in the Department of Disease Control at the Department of Health said it was too early to claim the second wave of the epidemic.
Three new domestic infections were identified in the Landspitan’s virology department yesterday and have been diagnosed with multiple infections.
Two domestic infections were detected on Thursday, one in a men's aged thirty, and the other in a men's age of twenty.
No infection had been detected since the beginning of the month.
Yesterday, three more domestic infections were detected, one of which had been at the Rey Cup in Laugardal.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, Minister of State, said in a conversation with the news agency that fewer people had to go to an exhibition because of the infection but was initially believed.
The second infection is with a person who arrived in the country from abroad on July 15th.
The rules of so-called return control have been adopted.
Kamilla Rut Sigfusdóttir, a specialist in the field of disease prevention at the Department of Medicine, says that the person concerned has, however, followed the old process.
His vision was negative at the time of his arrival, but he became ill and was isolated and six were put in custody.
They are all on their way to the show, but two of them are beginning to show signs.
The third infection is related to the older man who was diagnosed on Thursday and has been infected with 12 in relation to it.
It has been found that in this journey, a new variant of the coronavirus that has not been detected before in this country.
“We don’t know exactly where this virus comes from, but we haven’t seen it before.
Whoever is thought to have carried the virus to the country had been in Israel, but also in other European countries.
She believes it is too early to say that the so-called second wave of the epidemic has started in this country, like other countries in Europe fear.
“While the majority is still traceable, it’s not eating like that.
But we’re on our toes and are watching, thinking of ways to react if something like that could start.
Megan Fox spoke about the relationship.
Megan Fox claims to have found his twin soul in the rapper Machine Gun Kelly.
“When I met him and looked in his eyes, I knew.
“I’m interested in constellations, and I immediately knew that my twin soul was talking about,” Fox, 34, said.
“Two-burasal is when the soul has reached a sufficient level of existence to be able to split into two different bodies at the same time,” Fox explained.
“We are two half of the same soul, I think.
I told him as soon as we met.
I found it right away.
“When we had known him for two days, I asked him to meet me for lunch and I taught him about the constellations and asked him out into his life.
I decided to go to the depth immediately.
Machine Gun Kelly takes the same line, but they met in movies.
“I started hanging outside her caravan and hoped to see her.
She has the most beautiful eyes I’ve ever seen.
Only two months ago Fox left her husband to ten years old, Brian Austin Green.
They have three sons together.
Kanye apologizes to Kim
The American musician, the fashion club and President Kanye West have apologised for his wife Kim Kardashian West's comments that he made publicly about the family's personal affairs.
“I would like to apologize to my wife Kim for having discussed private affairs publicly,” he wrote on Twitter last night.
A great deal of disdain has been about the status of their relationship, but Kanye has recently gone to social media and at a crowd meeting he held last Monday, he discussed the birth of his daughter North West and said he almost killed her.
Kim then appeared on Wednesday and published a message to his followers on Instagram discussing her husband's illness, which he is diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Kardashian West has not before publicly expressed himself about her husband’s illness and says that, among other things, it is because of their children’s marriage and the rights of Kanye to the privacy of private life when it came to his health.

Increased weight in protests against racial discrimination in the United States
The protesters have walked the streets of many cities in the United States to draw attention to racial discrimination.
A protest has been held for two months in Portland, Oregon, since May 25 when George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Trump government has sent federal police officers to Portland, and this is where the protests continue.
The protesters also object to the presence of the police officers in the city.
In Seattle on Saturday, police used blast blasts and tear gas and arrested 45 people, after protests to support protests in Portland were dissolved in violence.
According to the police, over 20 police officers were injured.
One died on Saturday night in Austin, Texas, when a gun was fired into Black Lives Matter.
According to the media, the man may have gone up to a truck armed rifle before he was shot.
“The problem is that it’s terrible that someone should be killed in protests,” said Steve Adler, mayor of Austin.
Adler said he was “shammed and speechless.”
In Lousville, Kentucky, a group of armed protesters demanded justice in the case of Breonna Taylor, a black woman who died in Louisville when police broke into her home, with permission to enter without banking, and shot her.
Taylor's boyfriend had first shot the policemen, because he thought they were burglars.
A police officer has been fired for Taylor's death, but the other police officers have not been charged.
The leader of the NFAC group, armed with black rebels who have participated in the protests, calls for more transparency in the investigation of Taylor's murder.
According to the police, three members of the NFAC were injured on Saturday when the gun was accidentally fired by the rebel army.
Possible group infection in sealing
Five have been diagnosed with Covid-19 infection this week outside of border screening.
Two of them were diagnosed with the virus's previously unidentified variants and it seems that the origin of three of the five infections was completely unclear.
It is unclear whether the individuals have been infected by the tourism that has returned from the country or the atypical Icelander, who has probably infected much more.
The presence of a pathologist says that a possible group infection may be in the process of sealing one of the infections.
Two identified with Covid-19 in the country last Thursday, with either type of virus.
The origin of the infection is still unclear.
Three were then diagnosed with the virus yesterday; one of them has been infected by others who were diagnosed on Thursday, another came to the country on July 15 last, and probably was infected outside, but the third is also infected with light origin.
Following a serial analysis by Icelandic genetic analysis, it was found that the two individuals identified with the virus and associated with their new variants that have not been detected before in the country.
Kamilla Josefsdóttir, a specialist in the field of disease prevention at the Landsmyr and the site of a pathologist, says that Icelandic genetic analysis is now going to go over where this type of virus is most likely to have occurred.
“The other case was similar to the virus that has been running in Switzerland but still not exactly the same.
They’re going to look at this and try to map it better and lead the bodies to what the world’s disease comes,’ she says.
It seems to be on the Atlantic side, though.
This is why the infection is unrelated to the two who arrived in early July and were taken to the United States.
Do you assume that this new species has come to be outside rather than having a leap in the interior?
“Yes, this is different from what has been found here before that there is really no chance that it was something to grind here,” Kamilla replied.
“All the chances are that these people have somehow reached the heart of a person who is new somewhere outside, without knowing it themselves.
She said that there is no indication yet of where this new virus might have come from.
“It could be a tourist who has left the country again, but it could also be someone who does not get the symptoms and does not realize that he was infected and then naturally could cause more infection.
We’ll be on the toes for the next few days to keep track of it.
“There’s no such thing as a smart group infection yet.
However, there are individuals who have been exposed in connection with one of the infections yesterday, who have symptoms and have already been on display, - Kamilla continues.
“We haven’t had any results from them yet.
So there could possibly be a group infection in the seal.
Do you think there is a social disease going on now?
“It’s not impossible.
It has not been recently, but it is not excluded because we do not know who has been exposed to this infection in these individuals, which was detected on Tuesday and yesterday, however, she responds.
Could it be said that there is now a new wave of the virus?
“No, not yet.
But we naturally need to be very awake, and we need to keep that in mind, even though there are so certain limits to how much we can take in people’s visions.
“We don’t take samples from the non-significant people, but first we’re getting infections that seem to be inconvenient, we need to be given a little more loose hands by taking samples out of people with symptoms,” she says.
In this way, it can be expected that the Landspital’s infection and viral science division will be given in the next few days to try to map the status in Iceland better.
Does the county hospital have the ability to increase their domestic sample and take care of the screening at the border?
“Not unlimited, no.
Therefore, there needs to be some basis for taking samples in individuals who are not in the screening procedures; they need to be in the weaning and show signs or have been given symptoms and suspicions of having reached the toes of someone who is new to the country or something like that,\" Kamilla says.
It states that infection is still ongoing on the infections that were detected yesterday and that it is now taking a lot of effort to obtain information about the individual’s journeys.
She says that the origins of the internal infections appear to be inconclusive, but do not rule out that any of those who have now been infected can provide clues that ultimately lead the transmission team to the original infections.
The restaurant that gets to know but is one of the best
There are not all who are on the spot where the restaurant Bjargarsten is located and of course on it more fans abroad than here in the country if you can review it on TripAdvisor and other pages.

The way Prince Joakim said it was constant
Joakim Dana Prince, the younger son of Margaret Thorhildar Danadrotter and Henry's name, is still in the hospital in Toulouse, France, where he took action last day for blood clots in the brain.
The Danish government radio, DR, after the official of the Danish court, has found that it is unclear how long the prince, who is 51 years old, will be in the hospital, but his feeling is stable.
The report says that the effect of the blood loss on the prince’s health is now being investigated.
According to the doctor Peter Qvortrup Geisling, who discusses health issues for DR, the consequences of blood clots in the brain often do not occur until 24 hours after surgery.
“It can be anything from significant symptoms to hemorrhage, memory problems, or difficulty in expressing,” Geisling said.
He said that the prince could ask for many months of restoration.
Joakim Dana Prince, who is the full name of Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian and is also the Count of Monpezat, stayed at the family vineyard, Château de Cayx in South France when he was ill on Friday night.
He was first transferred to a hospital in Cahors, a town where he was taken from the farm, and then moved to the University Hospital in Toulouse, where he underwent surgery for blood clots in the brain.
Google Pixel 4 can form the galaxy
Double optical attraction allows the extra lens of Pixel 4 to be seen in three dimensions and thus deliver a better mother in the background with a face image setting than in previous Pixel phones, which relied on the alpha on software to achieve these so-called “bookeh” effects.
To demonstrate the quality of the camera, Google’s mythical photographer Annie Leibovitz got up in the field to discuss his experience of photography with Pixel 4 in the past 12 months.
Machine mining is still in the foreground of all aspects of new smartphones from Google and in this phone is “computer-controlled photography — new to improve HDR+ setting by combining up to nine different images.
New dual lighting controls offer different sleds for brightness and shade and allow users to preview HDR+ in real time.
The phone also relies on a motor race to offer a better automatic white jersey and improve the Night Sight night setting, which is so sensitive that it can capture the Milky Way in the night sky.
In addition to other camera lenses, Pixel 4 Soli-Rati-Rati-flash-phones — on the front of the phone that detects Motion Sense movements so that users can drop track, turn off timer, turn alarm on flash or turn off the phone's sound by wavering their hand.
All calculations Motion Sense takes place in the device instead of connecting the Internet and the same applies to improved Google helpers, where the technology is now focusing on shortening the reaction time and improving user privacy.
The continued focus of Google on using its machine learning skills to the full has also resulted in a new voice recording app that broadcasts audio live without sending data on the Internet.
The app is available only in English, but more languages are expected.
Pixel 4 will also be the first phone to support Google Stadia, a cloud gaming platform to be launched on the 19th of November in the United States, but still after reporting a date for Australia.
In addition to a new Pixel phone, Google also introduced a new Pixelbook Go Chromebook computer and other generation Google Pixel Buds hearing aids.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart hearing aids, which are likely to be in the next year, are completely wireless and have a sound adjustment that listens to the environment and tunes the sound constantly in line with it to make the clarity the most of.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smartphones are completely wireless and set the volume according to the noise around you.
Google also announced an update on its interconnected Wi-Fi home beds in the Nest WiFi line with special bones along with many basic sites working together to improve wireless connections within the home.
The new Wi-Fi system, which will record the Nest name, doubles its range of pastries and adds built-in microphones and speakers to use the Google helper in each base of the home.
It is sold in Australia on 5 November and costs 399 Australians for the bone and one Wi-Fi point or 549 dollars for two Wi-Fi points.
Google Home Mini has also been updated, but the new 79 dollar Nest Mini improves the sound quality by double the bass sand and has received built-in wall fastening.
All Google smartphone speakers will receive a new call system feature for communication between devices in the home as well as the ability to call the Nest Mini outside the home with the Google Home app.

\"I put a bottle of beer in a beer bottle in Devon.
A catcher threw a bottle of beer into a sales room when he interrupted the fishing line, according to a charity.
Pictures taken with Hope's Nose near Torquay appear to show a man on a rock throwing an item towards an animal.
Duncan Kenny, who took the pictures, said the gray seal has been hunting when the barrister was emptying out of a bottle and throwing it in the back of the animal.
Kenny called it “an inconvenient and ruthless behavior.”
He said he has been picking up trash in this beautiful place in Devon last Sunday morning along with other people in the Seal Project sales company when he witnessed the attack.
“The ship was trying to get to the fishing line,” he said.
“The keeper stretched the beer, emptyed the bottle, and threw it into the harness.
\"The cargo fell on the back of the seal and he swam away...
He said that “the best way to sell a strong animal was to do what was natural to him.
“By throwing a bottle of glass into him, you’re stopping him on his hunt,” he said.
The Seal Project company said that this was “not a unique case — and that it had just received — a lot of announcements about this aggressive behavior —
The Facebook post states that its volunteers collected 12 bags of garbage in the collection of Hope's Nose on Sunday and that \"many examples of antisocial behavior\" had been seen.
Everyone sells enjoys protection under the law of sale protection and people are asked to stay away from them.
Rising from Christian Poland in Laxá, Dölum
The first hundred people to hunt in Laxá in the valleys later today.
There was Arnór Isfjörð Gudmundsson.
He had been in a house in the hospital this morning and was 89 centimeters away.
After noon, he had a chance to reinvent the Christian Pole and was thought of a story he had heard that the slowdown would tend to slow down after the horse had been caught.
With this in mind, he took the crown of Collie Dog and threw it over the Christian pole.
Soon he got a take, and as he himself says.
“After five seconds, he completely cleaned up and I realized it was the record.
I was stressed because I had eleven pounds.
I usually catch fish, but I had it for forty minutes.
He was actually very comfortable.
I took a few trips up and down the pole but then I stranded him and it was a great feeling.
I screamed at him and jumped at him.
He measured 102 centimetres, and I doubled him,\" said a happy hunter in the LAXA hunting house in a conversation with a Spordal attack.
Arnór is no beginner when it comes to hundreds.
It was his eighth.
He had such fish in Blanda, Svartá, Hrásfjörður, Kvarrá, two in Langadalsá and one in the East Rangá.
A hunt is in Laxá in the valley, says Arnórs.
The hole that is ready for lunch tomorrow comes with 35 salmon and our man has eighteen of them.
We expect a lot of floods because of the design
Hanna, the first hurricane of the Atlantic this year, landed in Texas, United States.
Hanna quickly lost power and had to be unwinding but despite that, heavy rain has occurred in the area and is expected for extensive floods.
It is expected that up to 30 centimeters of rain in one day, but in special places it could reach up to 46 centimeters, according to the AP news agency.
This is especially the case with dangerous storms that could occur due to the rain.
The area where Hanna reached a country has been hit by a stroke due to the extensive distribution of the new crown virus there.
In addition, the sea has gone on land and caused damage.
At least 43,700 people are now without electricity and have been opening a crowd of help stations in the area.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, said it was important that people listen to experts and follow instructions.

Houses burned, shops robbed and injures
More than sixty have been killed and sixty more have been injured after the attack in the village of Master of Darfur in Sudan yesterday.
The attack “was the latest in a series of serious security incidents last week in which houses were burned, shops and markets robbed and injured,” according to a statement by the UN humanitarian agency in the capital of Kartum, which was sent out today.
Abdalla Hamdok, Prime Minister of Sudan, has announced that security forces will be sent to the war-stricken province to “protect the inhabitants and the harvest”
Only two days ago, the unknown army in the area killed at least 20 public citizens, including children, in another attack.
“The rise of violence in different parts of the Darfur region is leading to an increase in revolution, it puts agriculture at risk and threatens lives and livelihoods,” said the United Nations.
The conflict in Darfur, in the western part of Sudan, began in 2003 when rebels, who are Arabs, rose up against the governor of Kartum.
The armies of government and Arab troops, who tried to defeat the rebellion, have been accused of widespread brutality, but about 300,000 were killed in the conflict, according to the UN's assessment.
Omar al-Bashir, who was cast by a chair as leader of Sudan, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for intended war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity in Darfur.
Meanwhile, new governments in Sudan are now attempting to negotiate peace with major rebel groups.
A TV reporter thanks the viewer for noticing cancer
TAMPA, Florida (AP) — A Florida TV reporter thanks viewers for having noticed the knot on her neck and emailed her that she should have him checked.
Victoria Price, WFLA's reporter in Tampa, took this advice and was diagnosed with cancer.
Price said on Twitter that she had surgery on Monday to remove the tumour, thyroid, and several lymph nodes.
“The doctor said it was spreading, but not too much, and we hope this will be my first and last action,” she said.
The viewer sent Price email last month and said that the knot reminded her of the knot she had had.
Price, a 28-year-old investigator, said this week that her TV station's slogan was \"8 in a team with you --
“But the role was recently shifted when the viewer was on a team with ME and I couldn’t be more grateful,” Price said.
“I’ll be forever grateful to the woman who made the effort to send me an email, a completely unknown woman.
She had no obligation to do so, but she did.

Part of Jeronimo Open Space’s outdoor area temporarily closed after two attacks of smooth wolves — CBS Los Angeles
Two were bitten by smooth wolves near the Oso Creek route on Jeronimo Road in Mission Viejo on Saturday morning and the end needed the route temporarily.
Laura Wittmer says she sees smooth wolves almost every morning and usually tries to avoid them only, but on Saturday morning, one came straight to her and bites her in the foot.
The route has been closed while the attacks are being investigated.
Mission Viejo City published this incident saying: “Today, two different parties announced that the smooth wolf had bitten a person. The mission of Mission Viejo is working on the matter in collaboration with the division of fish and wildlife, and part Jeronimo Open Space has been closed. Show caution and be at the price when you are on a journey where there is a lot of wild animals...
Wittmer tried to beat off the smooth wolf with a water bottle.
She called in the emergency line to get to her car but could drive herself at an emergency.
The pregnant wolf disappeared in the hills, but public employees hope to run him and test him for homosexuality.
Wittmer is treated for rabies as a precautionary measure for the next two weeks.
She said that this terrible incident would not keep her from the morning races, but that from then on she would choose another place.
The situation of the person who was bitten is not clear.
The protesters of racial hatred meet with the Seattle police
A conflict in Seattle on Sunday between police and protesters against racial hatred ended with the arrest of a number of people, but discontent among the general public for Donald Trump's plans to send a number of federal police officers into major cities.
Anti-racial hatred and police violence have been triggered by the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minneapolis in May.
The Seattle protesters cut the wheelbar cars and broke a window in caravans on protests on Saturday, causing police to declare the rioting situation and toss the streets with pepper sprays and blast blasts.
The protestors also set fire to caravans on a building site for the future youth prison.
Police said they arrested 45 people, but 21 police officers were injured.
The protest was held in support of the protests in the neighboring city of Portland, Oregon.
Portland is in the scene light after Trump ordered a great deal of radical action by the federal police, in spite of the local authorities, who say the police use excessive power.
Contests have been held in Austin, Texas, as well as Louisville, Kentucky, New York, Omaha, and Nebraska, Oakland, and Los Angeles, California, and Richmond, Virginia.
In Austin, the capital of the Texas State, one was shot dead in armed conflicts in the city center on Saturday night, according to the police.
Along with the protests, Trump is increasingly difficult to fight for re-election in November, and has committed a harsh rule of law.
