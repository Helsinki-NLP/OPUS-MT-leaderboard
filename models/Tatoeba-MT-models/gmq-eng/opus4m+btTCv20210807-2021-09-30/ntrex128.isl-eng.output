The locals are worried about “looking like a fool.”
Uggur is in some council members because of a proposal to have their titles changed in MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the House of Representatives).
The concerns have been raised because of plans to change the name of the council to the Senate.
Members of all groups are worried that it could make them laugh.
A member of the Labour Party said that his party was worried that “it is fighting with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers living outside Wales: in velsk, twp means wrong and pwp means sheep.
Plaid Cymru said that the whole party was “dissatisfied” and has made other suggestions.
A member of the charity team said that his party had “open mind” about the name change, but pointed out that there was no big difference between the word MWP and Muppet (flon).
In this context, it can be noted that the velski letter w is worn similar to u in Icelandic.
The council, which is now working on a law-making radio to present the name changes, said: “The decision on all the names of the members of the council will, of course, lie with the members themselves.
The Government of Wales (The Government of Wales Act 2017) gave the Council the power to change its name.
In June, the council released the results of the public polls which showed a great deal of support for calling the council a welfare committee.
With regard to the title of the council, the WMP (Welsh Parliament members, electors) elected, but MWP received the most support from the public in the polls.
According to news, councillors are now proposing other proposals, but it may be difficult to reach an agreement for the Chairman of the Council, Elin Jones, who is to submit a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The bill on the amendments will also include other changes to how the Council works, including the rules on the exclusion of council members and the organisation of the committee system.
Councillors will be able to pay final votes on their title when discussion of the bill begins.
The Macedonians voted in elections for a change in the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country’s name in the “North Macedonian Republic”
This issue was voted in an attempt to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province with the name Macedonia.
Attenuborg has long argued that their name in the north is equivalent to the requirement in its territory and has repeatedly protested their applications for membership to the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the name change, has said that he will not view the elections as valid.
However, supporters of the vote, including the Prime Minister of Zoran Zaev, have said that the name change is simply the price that needs to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Church is a church in Harlem in trouble
“Elder the people I’ve spoken to said that before, a bar and a church could be found on every corner,” said Mr. Adams.
“Today, neither one can be found there.
He said it would be understandable for the bar to sink.
\"People have other ways to meet,\" he said.
“Bars are no longer the hubs of the neighborhood where people come together regularly...
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money left from the sale of property will not last as long as leaders expect, and sooner or later they will be back in the beginning,
He added that possible churches would be replaced by residential homes that would be full of people who would not help to save the remaining refuges of the surrounding area.
“The largest majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings become white,” he said, “and will therefore rush for the complete closure of these churches, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move in these apartments will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became the center of black - the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and the St. Martin Church decades later.
The original white Methodist group moved away in the 1930s.
A group of people who had worked nearby took over the building.
A group of people took over St. Martin’s Church under the direction of Father John Howard Johnson, who took the initiative to avert shoppers on the 125th Street, the main shopping street of Harlem, who wanted to hire a packed staff or provide them with jobs.
The building was seriously damaged in the fire in 1939, but members of the congregation of Father Johnson made plans to rebuild it and also let them build the clock game.
Dr. David Johnson, son and successor of Professor Johnson, called the bell proudly \"the clocks of the poor people,\"
The expert who played the clock game in July called it a different name: “A cultural fund — and a unique historical instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also stated that this was the first time in the world that black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, played on, but he moved on to a larger clock game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had not had anyone else in his place.
Over the past few months, many architects and contractors have made their way to St. Martin, some of whom have been hired by the leaders of the Church and others of the Episcopal District.
In July, the Council of Churches, which oversees the application and organizes church leaders, wrote the Episcopal District and declared its concern that the Episcopal Empire “picture seeks to bring the cost to the church, even if it had not been involved in the recruitment of the architects and contractors sent by the Bishophood.
Some members complained about the lack of transparency of the Episcopal Empire.
Shark wounds a 13-year-old boy who dived after a lobster in California
According to the government, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and wounded him on Saturday when the boy was diving after a lobster in California on the first day of the lobster fishing season.
The attack was just before seven o’clock in the morning near the Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shout for help and then ride over along with others to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first, he thought it was just a thrill to get a homage, but then he realized that the boy was crying, “I was bitten!
I was bitten.
All his legs were broken up,\" Hammel said of what he saw when he came to the boy.
“I cried out to everyone to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water,’ Hammel added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady children's hospital in San Diego where he is seriously injured.
It is not known what kind of shark is attacked by the boy.
The captain of the beach guards, Larry Giles, said at the media meeting that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks before, but he was not of a dangerous kind of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered a serious injury to the upper part of the body.
The area closed beach access from the Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to the Swami’s beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, for research and security purposes.
Giles said that over 135 different species of shark are in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plan to take a break in the UK’s cosmetic market
Sainsbury’s plans to compete with Boots, Superdrugs, and Debenhams with cosmetics in a shopping mall style and with specialized assistants.
This is part of a plan to enter the UK cosmetics market, which is £2.8 billion worth of value and is increasing as the sales of fashion and household goods go down. The larger cosmetic shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be set up in more stores next year if successful.
Investment in cosmetics is part of the way of supermarkets to use shelf locks previously used by televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury’s says it will double its cosmetic selection for up to 3,000 product types, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also have increased space with marked areas similar to those found in the stores such as Boots.
The shop also intends to start re-sale on its Boutique brandy selection so that the majority of the products are vegan-friendly, but younger consumers demand it to an ever greater extent.
In addition, the fragrance Shop will test the product manager in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opened in Croydon, south London last week, and the next will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and increased consumer tendency to buy a small amount of food daily in the neighborhood stores mean that large markets need to contribute more to getting people to come to them.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury’s, said the stores would look like shopping malls to a greater extent as the shopping chain tries to fight the low-priced Aldi and Lidl stores with more services and other products than food.
Sainsbury’s has put Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced to the history of the number of Habitat apartments since both chains were purchased two years ago, and according to them, it has increased sales and made the purchase more profitable.
The first attempt by the shop to revive its cosmetics and pharmaceuticals units failed well.
Sainsbury’s tested co-operation with Boots around 2000, which ended due to a dispute over how to share the sales of drugs in the supermarket.
The new direction comes from Sainsbury’s selling its 281 pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds drug stores, in £125 million three years ago.
According to the policy, Lloyds will play a role in these plans by adding a large selection of luxury skin brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, manager of Sainsbury’s market, said: “We’ve broken the look of our cosmetic shelves to improve the environment for our customers.
We also have investments in special training for staff who will be within the scope of advice.
Our product selection is designed to meet all the needs. Healthy environment and convenient location make us an exciting cosmetic store that transforms old shopping habits.
Peter Jones - after Holly Willoughby cancels 11 million pounds deal
Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons Den series, became the “adventure — after the television historian Holly Willoughby broke up with a £11 million contract with his company to focus on new agreements with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their household product and accessories brand, Truly.
The company had been similar to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
Willoughby, 37-year-old present in the series This Morning, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has understood Peter Jones, the star of Dragons’ Den, after his painful ending by stopping participating in a popular lifestyle company in the latter hour to focus on new and profitable agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones has been the “extreme — at a difficult meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business state in Marlow, Buckinghamshire when the TV woman popularly acknowledged she did not have enough time for the household product and accessories brand Truly because of the new contracts worth up to £1.5 million.
The company has been similar to Goop, the Gwyneth Paltrow brand, and was intended to double the assets of Willoughby, but their estimated value is £11 million.
When Willoughby, aged 37, announced on Instagram that she intended to withdraw from Truly, Jones flew from Britain to stay in one of her many summer homes.
According to one reporter, \"Truly was the longest on Holly's priority list.
This was to be her future project that would take her for the next two decades.
Her decision to stop all came to an open shield.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so short for the line to go on the market.
There is a full stock of products in the headquarters of Marlow that are ready to go to sale
Experts believe that the elimination of this Morning present, which is among the most popular stars in the UK, can cost the company millions because of the high-quality warehouses, ranging from pads and candles to clothes and household products, and possibly cause further delays in the sale of the product line.
This could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, three children's mother, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends of Jones and his wife, Töru Capp, for a decade.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined them as chairman of the board in March.
The couple spend their summer vacations together and Jones share 40 percent of Baldwin's company, which produces television.
Willoughby will be the official representative of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as the ITV I'm a Celebrity.
James Jones said, “We don’t want to say anything about his business.
Hard talk, and then we became lovers.
He ran with the criticism he received from the media, for saying something that many would consider inappropriate to the president, and for being so positive in the face of head of North Korea.
Why has President Trump left so much behind?
He said Trump and followed a reporter’s voice.
“I haven’t given anything left...
He stated that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards nuclear disarmament North Korea.
However, talks about putting down nuclear weapons have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the chief ambassador to North Korea, told the International Leader of the General Assembly of the United States on Saturday that the north had not received “the appropriate response — from the United States at the first steps in North Korea towards nuclear disarmament.
He said that instead, the U.S. continued to maintain a business model for the purpose of maintaining pressure.
Trump was more positive in his conversation.
“We are very close to North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
Now our relationship is great.
He said his attempts to improve Kim's relationship have returned positive results - rocket tests had stopped, hostages had been released and the earthly remains of American soldiers were returned home.
He also had an unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act like President, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into a crowded stadium, there were only 200 people standing there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Floods and earthquakes in Indonesia cause severe damage to the island, hundreds have died
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, the International Rescue Organizations were told that they were not needed.
Even though more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population had to flee their homes, an emergency was not declared, but it is the prerequisite for the international community to have assistance there.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have stated clearly that they are not going to ask for help from international organizations, so this is difficult,” said Sumbung.
While the Save the Children organization is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known when foreign aid workers may have jobs in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, the national disaster agency spokesman, said that Indonesian officials are evaluating the situation in Pala to see if the international organisations should help with the relief work.
Based on how common earthquakes are in Indonesia, the country is unfortunately poorly prepared to defend its natural forces.
The flood waves have been built in Aceh, but they are rare sights on other shorelines.
It seems that the warning of flood waves in Palu has increased even though a warning has been issued.
Even in the best of circumstances, it can be challenging to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make planning even more complex.
A ship that has been docked in Lombok to wait for the victims of the earthquake is now on its way to Pala, but it will take at least three days to get to the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made it the main point of his campaign to restore the downturned transportation routes of Indonesia and he has spent a lot of money on roads and railroads.
However, lack of funding has plagued the government of Mr Joko, but elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also needs to struggle with sustained tensions between religions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative religion.
Over 1,000 people died, and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as Christian and Muslim marches fought on the streets with weaves, bows, and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool player, equal to Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing against Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring the 89th minute in Saturday's game at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a shipment from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal as his team was under 1-0.
He rolled the ball to the left and then tried to shoot to the mark towards the far pole.
The ball flew high across the border and towards its right corner.
The ball finally crossed the Kepa Arrizabalaga, which jumped up, and in the net.
“I just wanted to try to get into this position, to catch the ball, and players like Shaq always play it as long as possible so I tried to create as much time as I could,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come and touched once and didn’t think so much about it, but just took the shot...
Chelsea was over 1-0 in half after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in 25 minutes.
In the search, the Chelsea seeker gave the ball with a heel spin to Mateo Kovacic and then spread from the center to the half of Liverpool.
Kovacic made the ball go fast between the middle.
He then sent the ball out beautifully and sent Hazard in for the witty.
Hazard fired defenders and scored in the corner with a left-handed shot over Alisson Becker, Liverpool's goalkeeper.
Liverpool plays against Naples in the pre-election stage at 15:00 on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea game against Videoton in the UEFA European Division at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
The number of dead rises to 832 by flood in Indonesia
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and floods in Indonesia has risen to 832, as reported by the country’s disaster organization early on Sunday.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman of the agency, said at the press conference that a number of people had been buried when constructions collapsed in the earthquake that occurred on Friday and was 7.5 points on the Richter scale. The earthquake caused flood waves that reached up to 6 meters altitude.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with quarries from buildings that had collapsed.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man, suspected of murder, after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has begun after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with a stroke was found at 7:55 a.m. this morning near Grayson Mews on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested, suspected of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to give up if they saw or heard anything.
Brian O'Hagan, investigator, said: “The investigation is just beginning, but I would like to ask all those who were in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they saw or heard anything suspicious.
Also, I would like to ask everyone, especially the taxi manager, who could have got something on the picture with their car cameras to contact us, because they could have important information for our study...
The police officer has confirmed that the woman who died in Birkenhead and that she was found inside an apartment.
In the afternoon, people who thought they knew the woman came to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and police say they work to let the victim’s closest members know.
The driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, tried to get back to his apartment, but police told him that no one could enter the building or leave it.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
People have now been told that many hours may pass until they can go back in.
The police said that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman came to the scene.
She kept saying, “It’s so horrible.
At 14:00, there were two police cars inside the police area and one car just outside it.
Many police officers stood within the marked area and watched the apartment buildings.
Anyone who may have any information is asked to send a direct message at @MerpolCC, call 101, or contact anonymously with the Crime Line by phone 0800 555 111 and give up number 247 from September 30.
The last British Congress of Cromwell is the latest landmark that is accused of “rewriting the story”
The ban would be poetic justice for the Taliban destruction of his imperialist Puritan followers on so many cultural and religious démocles of England.
The Cromwell company, however, said that Mr. Crick’s proposal was “fought — and “try to re-write the story.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the discussion that continues to remove the card, it was inevitable that the short of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be before the battle.
The Andophe of the English Civil War against Cultural Signs was neither forecommand nor the implementation of Cromwells.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of Thomas his ancestors in the past century.
The magnificent map of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, marks the 19th-century era and is part of a man’s history that many people believe is not yet worthy of praise.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps rather late in the 19th century than today, has been the protector of the Congress against foreign pressure, in his case the king’s empire.
There’s still a lot of historical differences as to whether this description is entirely correct.
However, it is certain that the conflict in the mid-17th century has shaped the development of our nation and that Cromwell is a known individual who is the representative of one side of their conflict.
It is worth praising and recalling his achievements as a protector of the state.
Pig attacks a Chinese farmer and kills him
Pigs attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him on the market in the southwest of China, according to news from the site.
The man named only by his surname “Yuan” was found dead with broken arteries and covered blood near the stylus on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, according to South China Morning Post on Sunday.
Swingball prepares to inject a vaccine into a pig on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to the report, he had traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the uncle found him dead and saw that a door into a nearby pig's restaurant was open.
He said inside the stair had been a big mouth with a bloody mouth.
The trial confirmed that the 250 kg cylinder had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s feet were bloody and wounded,” said the cousin, with the surname, “Wu, with Guiyang Evening News.
Recording from a security camera showed Yuan coming on the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The owner of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that it did not attack anyone else while police collected evidence in the field.
According to news, Yuan’s family and owners are in talks about damages for his death.
There are examples of pigs attacking people, although rare.
In 2016, pigs attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and severely wounded the man.
Ten years earlier, 300 kg of pigs clogged the veld with a tractor until his wife cut off the animal.
After a Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that blood taste can awaken aggressiveness in them.
“They’re just playing.
They want to flash and are curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
“You just have to show them respect,” he said.
The remains of the hurricane Rosa carry a great deal of rainfall across the southwest of the United States
As predicted, the magnitude of the hurricane is decreasing as it passes over a cooler sea on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry a great deal of rainfall that could cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa became a hurricane in category 1, with a wind speed of up to 136 km per hour, at 5 a.m. in the morning to East Beach on Sunday, and it was located over 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will go north on Sunday.
At the same time, it is in the formation of the Pacific Ocean, and it will go east towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa arrives at the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will thus follow a great tropical attack in the north-west into the southwest of the United States.
Rosu will accompany up to 25 cm of waste in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the turret will be mixed with the tropics that approach and form large and widespread rainfall over the southwest part of the next few days.
Local 2.5 to 10 cm of precipitation can cause dangerous sudden lobes, soil movement, and possible slits in the desert.
A massive hot tub will cause up to 5 to 10 cm of rainfall per hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation is expected in some places in the southwest part, especially in the most off Arizona state.
There is a possibility of quick-paced climates due to the spread of tropical rains.
People are strongly advised not to walk into the desert when there is a risk of tropical rain.
Large rains can turn the guilds into a ferocious flow and thunderstorms have caused heavy winds and dust storms.
The site that is approaching will carry a local shelter in certain areas on the South California coast line.
The possibility is on more than 1 cm of precipitation that could cause slight movement of the soil and the sheer of the roads.
This is the first source of the region during the rainy season.
Several scattered hot tubs will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the outcome spread over larger areas late Monday and Tuesday.
The result will spread over four states on Tuesday and will end on Wednesday.
It is expected that in October all the U.S., major changes in temperature can be expected as the North Atlantic region progresses to a high level, but the turret continues to be quite warm.
Sometimes this can cause high temperature swings over short distances.
There was a very good example of a high temperature difference in the U.S. on Sunday.
There are almost 7 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent summers will try to build up and spread out again.
It is expected that much of the Central and Eastern United States will receive a warm start of October with temperatures of around 25 degrees or more from the plains of the south to the north-east.
The temperature could rise to 25 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term forecast suggests that there is a high risk of temperature above the average for the eastern part of the United States in the previous half of October.
Over 20 million people watched over Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million people looked at the exciting testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court judge, on Tuesday and the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual crimes that had occurred in the 9th century. The testimony was sent out on six different channels.
At the same time, the political patrol continued and television stations interrupted the regular schedule to publish the latest news on Friday: Jeff Flake, a Arizona senator, presented a bill to the FBI to investigate the allegations for one week.
Ford told the Senate Judge Committee that she was confident that Kavanaugh had swallowed her up and tried to undress her at a school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he was confident that it had not happened.
It is likely that more people looked at the trial than the 20.4 million that Nielsen reported to have watched on Friday.
The company measured the average views of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC television channels.
Figures were not available immediately for other television channels showing the interviews, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen is usually in trouble measuring people’s views in offices.
To put this in context, this audience is similar to the size and for the finish in football or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, most of the interviews, which took place all day, watched Fox News Channel or 5.69 million.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.99 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
There was a great deal of interest after the trial.
Flake was the center of the game on Friday.
After the office of this Republician Party Senator issued a notice that he would vote Kavanaugh in favor, CNN and CBS took photos of when the protesters called him on Friday morning, when he tried to enter a lift to attend a meeting of the Judicial Committee.
He stood down for a few minutes while raining over him at CNN's live broadcast.
One woman said, “I’m standing right here in front of you.”
“Do you think he’s telling the people the truth?
People said to him, “You have power while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office has released a statement and before the elevator door closed, he said he would rather express himself at the committee meeting.
The cable and television stations all had direct broadcasts later when the Judiciary Committee asked whether to send Kavanaugh's nomination for election at the Senate.
Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the other nominees for the next week, but the minority of Democrats has encouraged it.
Flake partly convinced his friend Chris Coons, Democratic Senator.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several other senators after that.
Flake’s vote was based on the fact that the Republicans did not have enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without the study.
President Trump has granted permission to investigate the FBI's allegations against Kavanaugh.
May, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, accuses critics of “being in a political game” because of Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Theresa May, Prime Minister, accused her critics of her plan to leave the European Union to “be in a political game — about the future of Britain and undermine the interests of the country.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, will attend the Conference of the Party of Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, which was published next to her interview on the front page of the magazine, Boris Johnson, her former Foreign Minister, was awarded the so-called Chequers Plan on Brexit and said that the UK and the European Union should be responsible for the customs clearance of each other, “generally dissipated.”
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpsons in connection with the death of the LSU player
Police arrested one suspect due to the death of Wayde Sims in a deadly shooting, and he was a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for a second-degree murder charges, according to Baton Rouge police.
The government released a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson and said Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found a kidney from Simpson on them, according to the WAFB sister company CBS.
The police said Simpson confessed that he shot Wayde and killed him.
According to his lawyer, there was a guarantee of $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge County Department of Justice published a preliminary report on Friday saying that the cause of death is a gun shot in the head and down the neck.
The authorities would like to thank the Louisiana Police Department, the police investigation department, the Southern University University Police and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, chairman of the LSU, thanked law enforcement officers for their “cost and search for justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall two metre forward grew up in Baton Rouge where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He scored 5.6 points on average and took 2.6 off for each game in the last season.
Will Wade, LSU basketball coach, said on Friday morning that the team was “harmed — and “in a shock — because of the death of Wayde.
“It’s something you’re worried about all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano over Mexico City
The ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern part of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity increased in the gear and recorded 183 cases of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center watched vibrations and quakes from the volcano.
Pictures on social media showed a thin layer of ashes on cars in the neighborhood of Mexico City, such as in Xochimilco.
Earth scientists have observed increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since the earthquake of 7.1 on Richter rode across the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as the Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separation rights for the anniversary of the independence vote
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent protesters met the riot police and thousands participated in protests for the first anniversary of the disputed election in Catalonia to declare independence.
A group of masked separationists stoned the riot police with eggs and threw a powder painting that formed a dark cloud of dust on the street, which would usually be otherwise full of tourists.
There was also a conflict that broke out later that day and the police applied the bats to keep the rivers in check.
A group of divorcers shouted, “We don’t forget, and we don’t forgive — for a few hours while their opponents cried out, “I don’t live Spain.”
Forty-four people had to pay attention to the minor injuries they suffered in the protests, according to the media in the area.
Great tensions continue in the independent region one year after the referendum on 1 October was judged unlawful by the Madrid authorities, but was celebrated by the Catalan divorceists.
The majority of voters chose independence, but participation was poor as most of those who opposed separation ignored the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were killed last year when police tried to stop the elections in elections across the area, but it was in conflict with them.
The groups of independents had stayed overnight on Friday to prevent protests in support of the country's police.
The protest took place but was forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrical engineer, took part in protests with his wife and said that he was no longer hopeful that Catalonia would gain independence.
“In the past we had some of our best moments.
“I saw my parents crying for joy in being able to kiss, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite having achieved the necessary but few victories in the recent December regional negotiations, independent groups of Catalonia have had difficulty keeping steam this year, with many of the most well-known leaders being either in voluntary exile or in detention waiting for trial because of their role in the organisation of the vote and the independence declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old robot who took the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that both states had urged the conflict.
\"The tension is increasing,\" he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison and asked for a trial from the late last year, announced that he would submit himself to the European Parliament next year.
“My proposal in the European elections is the best way to condemn the return in the area of democratic values and the repression we have seen the Spanish government apply,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after the car was driven to the house
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, have been arrested after driving on a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. to British time.
Bob Blemmings, the investigator, said the gate and the building themselves had been damaged.
It is also possible that the shot was from a crossbar towards the vehicle.
Menga scores in 1-0 win Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga
The Livingston team, who came from the lower division, got Rangers in an open shield and Steven Gerrard had to suffer his second loss in 18 games as the executive director of the Ibrox team.
Mark Dolly Menga made the lead and Gary Holt's team is now in a second seat with Hibernian.
The team Gerrard has not yet worked in the outskirts of this season and games against Hearts, which are eight points ahead of the top seat, the next Sunday.
For this game, Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna in the European Division on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston is still undefeated in the league with six wins, and Holt's main coach has not yet had to experience loss since he replaced Kenny Miller in the last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against unbiased guests
Holts had to be over long before it scored the goal, but their bones caused Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then shot a pass after passing through the defense to receive a shell broadcast from Graig Halkett across the border.
The guests allowed the Rangers to play in front of them in silence, knowing that they could cause the guests trouble in the right places.
And that was how the goal was important.
Rangers won an extra match and Livingston won to create a market opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga in unity, which received a broadcast and scored from the middle of the suite.
At that stage, Rangers had ruled over the ball, but the defense of the locals was unbreakable and Liam Kelly, a goalkeeper did not have to put on much.
That’s how this continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos managed to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by the feet of Allan McGregor, the goalkeeper Rangers, and Lithgow shot from the finish after a search by Livingston.
Spyrnur was constantly hit by Vitteig Livingston, but was fired from, and two demands for a white spot - after Halkett's defense against his replacement Glenn Middleton, and one by one - were dismissed.
“Excellent” — Livingston
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland reporter at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Excellent performance and results for Livingston.
For a normal man, they stood great and continued to go beyond all expectations of their journey.
Their style of play and team members have hardly changed anything since they got back into the top division, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for having punted the team together since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, the team was extremely good and led a fully organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worralll on his toes all the time.
Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
As good as they have been under the control of Gerrard, they played far under expectation.
They failed to complete their quests and only once managed to open the field half of the locals so this should be an alarm for the Rangers who are now sitting in the middle of the league.
Erdogan receives mixed receptions in Cologne
It was a smiled and bright sky on Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met over breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan's tour to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the two nations.
There have been differences between them due to issues such as human rights, freedom of the media and the accession of Turkey to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open new, huge mosque.
The city is the home of most of the Turkish people outside of Turkey itself.
The police used security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters were able to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them Kurds - were also heard and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the decision of German government to offer him to the country.
The two protest groups reflect the extent of this guest's controversy, but he is hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and hated as a dictator by others.
Raced in Deptford: A cyclist killed in a crash with a car
A cyclist killed a car in London.
It became close to the streets of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a multi-story street in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, about 10.15 p.m. to the British local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulances provided shelter, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident happened a few months after another cyclist was killed in a crash where a driver drove away on Childers Street, 1.5 km from Saturday's accident.
The police said she was working to identify the man and let his loved ones know.
The road has been closed and the road has been closed and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
The Long Lartin Prison: Six Rates Injured in Insurgents
Six prisoners were injured when riots broke out in a men's security prison, according to a police officer's report.
Óirður broke out in the Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at 9:30 p.m. to British local time on Sunday and still stay.
\"Tornado, special forces have been called in the area to try to stop the insurrections that eight prisoners are involved, and are only in one aluminium of the prison.
The guards suffered from minor injuries to the face in the field.
The prison officer said: “The trained prison guards have been called out to deal with cases that are ongoing in the Long Lartin prison.
Six employees have suffered from injury.
There is no violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that the police will be handed over and could expect to spend even more time behind the lock and strike...
Over 500 prisoners sit in the Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison officer had to go to the hospital after a prisoner attacked him.
And in October of last year, riot police were called to the place to deal with serious disruption to peace, where they attacked employees with billiards.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City is threatened by the hurricane (dry areas could benefit)
It is rare to cross Arizona, but it is likely that it will be early in the next week when the remains of the hurricane Rosu will pass over the southwest part, at risk of sudden floods.
The country's weather facility has already issued warnings for emergency lights for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and western Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will cross Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive late Monday with precipitation.
The Phoenix weather facility said on Twitter that only “ten parachutes have been able to maintain their strength to be classified as hot dogs storms or lows in less than 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km of Arizona border
The most recent forecasts from the national hurricane centre predict 5-10 cm of precipitation, with a single precipitation of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
It is likely that the yield will be 2.5 to 5 cm in other areas of the southwest part, including the centre of the mountain cliffs and the lower large (The Great Basin), with the possibility of a single precipitation of up to 10 cm.
For those who are not at risk of landing in emergency areas, the outcome of Rosu could be a blessing because there are a lot of droughts in the area.
Although floods can cause severe damage, some of this waste will have a positive effect, since drought is now in the southwest part.
According to the U.S. Drying Authority, at least 40 percent of Arizona is highly dried, which is the second-highest party, according to news from weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa was still classified as a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 136 km per hour and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and travels to the north-east at 19 km per hour.
The storm goes over a cooler sea in the Pacific Ocean, and so his power is decreasing.
It is expected that he will be in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday or Monday evening.
There is a potential for high rainfall in some areas of Mexico, with a significant risk of flooding.
“The waste is expected to be up to 7.5 to 15 cm in Baja California and into the northwestern part of Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 cm of precipitation,” the weather.com reported.
Rosa will then keep north across Mexico, as a tropical storm, and then reach Arizona's border early on Tuesday morning as a hot tub. She will then continue through Arizona and arrive in southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
“The main risk expected to originate from Rosa or its remains is a huge outcome in Baja California, the northwestern part of Sonora, and in the southwest of the U.S. desert area,” said the county’s Fellibry Center.
This outcome is expected to cause life-threatening shocks and movement on the ground in the deserts, and to take place in the mountains.
The attack in Midsome Norton: Four arrests for murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-old man have been arrested suspected of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The youth player was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsome Norton, about 4 p.m. to British local time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition is said to be “stressful.”
One 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to police from Avon and Somerset.
Police have asked witnesses who could have phone recordings of what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh has “fell to feel the evil and the anger of the Democratic Party.”
“The vote in support of Kavanaugh judges is a vote that rejects the ruthless and shameful practices of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a meeting with supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “fell to feel the evil and the anger — from the Democratic Party out of his entire process of nomination.
Kavanaugh testified to the Congress on Thursday, where he harassed the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford that he harassed her sexually for a few decades when they were both teenagers.
Ford also witnessed the committee's allegations.
The president said on Saturday, “The Americans had seen genius and humanity and bravery,” Kavanaughs said.
\"A vote to confirm Kavanaugh's judge is a vote that confirms one of our finest lawyers' time, a lawyer with an elegant record as an official employee,\" he said to a group of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president pointed out indirectly in Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of the Republicans' involvement in the mid-term negotiations.
“There are five weeks in one of the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not asking, but I really do,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going to fight for great candidates.
Trump claimed that Democrats were working to “tack and prevent...
The first key vote on the floor of the International Youth League on Kavanaugh's nomination should take place no later than Friday, according to a representative of the Republicans in an interview with CNN.
Hundreds of people died after an earthquake and flood in Indonesia, and likely that the number of dead will rise
At least 384 people were killed and many were washed away by a huge century on the shores, when a great earthquake and a flood rode over the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six meters high centuries were on the beach at sunset, throwing out a number of people on the sea and destroying everything that happened to them.
This earthquake occurred after a 7.5-point earthquake in Richter.
“When the flood wave was formed yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so it died,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesia disaster, at a Jakarta information meeting.
“The flood did not come alone, she brought cars, trees, houses, shells, all that was in the land,” Nugroho said, adding that the flood wave had traveled across the open sea at 800 kilometres [800 km] of speed before it was on the beach.
Some climbed into a tree to escape the flood and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos of the air, published by the disaster agency, showed many destroyed buildings and shops, winding and unused bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
After earthquakes, the city continued to ride across the beach on Saturday.
The area of the earthquake was visited by 2.4 million people.
The creation of Indonesia on food and technology use, said that the hurricane, which was released in the Greatquake on Friday, had been about 200 times more than from the atomic explosion that fell on the city of Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, located at the end of a long and thin river, could have increased the size of the flood wave, the agency said.
Nugroho said the damage was “real” and thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels had collapsed.
The body of a few victims was found stuck under a quarries of collapsed buildings, he said and added that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the decline and property damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu in an area called Dongglaa, which is closer to the earthquake's recordings.
\"Communications \"are completely downgraded and no information is received\" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“There are over 300,000 people living there,” said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the area.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” the Red Cross said.
The agency was criticized by many on Saturday for not letting know that the flood wave had washed up in Pala, although public officials said the centuries had come within the time the warning was issued.
In a video released on social media, a man could hear from the top floor of buildings to warn the people on the street below that the flood wave was approaching.
A few minutes later, the flood wave hits the beach and carries away buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't confirm the video right away.
The earthquake and flooding caused powerlessness that hindered communication with Palu and made the authorities difficult to organize aid work.
The army is beginning to send aircraft with relief products from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but people who have been helped by the area still need food and other needs to be maintained.
The city's airport has only been opened again for aid operations and will be closed until October.
Joko Widodo, President of the United States, will visit the Pala refugee centres on Sunday.
The number of deaths exceeds 800 after a flood in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
The staff of the World Vision from Donggala has reached the whole and the mill of the city of Palu, where it seeks shelter in camping cities that were set up in the garden outside their offices. The destruction of the property passed with them on the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
\"People said they saw a lot of houses,\" he said.
The situation is very bad.
Help groups have started difficult relief work, but some have complained that foreign assistants with great expertise would be restrained from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and staff may only begin to arrive if the accident area is declared a disaster area.
It hasn't been done yet.
“It’s still a local accident area,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared that this is a disaster area, we can open for foreign aid, but no statement has yet come,
When the second night fell over Pala after the earthquake and the flood on Friday, friends and families who are still missing kept hoping that their loved ones would be one of the miracle stories that shed hope on the devastating predictions that follow natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from the start.
On Sunday, aid workers rescued a woman who had been pinned down for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian Flying Team, had been the coach of two currently missing flyers for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who stayed in the Roa Roa hotel were his students, including Mr. Mandagi.
“As a man with a long experience in flying, I have my own emotional burden to bear,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said that the hour after news came within the hovering group because the Roa Roa hotel collapsed, he had sent WhatsApp a message in despair to the contestants who stayed in Pala and participated in the beach festival.
His message, however, showed only a gray sign, instead of a blue one.
“I think the message was not received,” he said.
Thiefs steal $26,750 we fill in in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed $26,750 of Brink's employee, who was filling in a Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police report.
The driver of the car had been emptying the ATMs in the entertainment area and was making more money on it,\" said Dennis McCarthy, a police officer, in the announcement.
When he was on his job, another man came “running behind the Brink employee — and stole a cash bag intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects escape from the scene, according to the report, but police did not give up how many were concerned about the matter.
Those who may have information about the suspects are asked to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name in Ye
The rapper Kanye West is going to change his name - in Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday and wrote: “The world that was previously known as Kanye West...
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the name as the title of the eighth album that came out in June.
The change occurs for his participation in the Saturday Night Live show where it is expected that he will announce his new album, Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grandi on the show, but she stopped for “a emotional reason,” the producer said.
West has said that this name has a religious meaning for him, but it is also a shorten of his current name.
“I think that “yes” is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you,” West said earlier in the year when he spoke the name of his album to the radio director Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, that’s us.
It came from Kanye, which means the only one, and into just Ye - to be just a reflection of the good in us, the evil, the confused, everything.
The album is more reflective of who we are.
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, the former co-worker of West, has also written his name both with and without a ribbon and a maximum.
The President of Mexico said he would not use the army against the general city.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected President of Mexico, has pledged to never use military force against general citizens, now that the country will soon commemorate the 50th anniversary of the bloody revenge of students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised to “use the army never ever to oppress the Mexican people.”
The soldiers shot a peaceful protest in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people on time when the left-wing movement of students was shooting roots across all Roman America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico by giving all students monthly strength and opening up more free public university.
He has said that unemployment and lack of learning opportunities attract young people to crime.
The United States of America should double its funding for satellite technology.
Now that China is increasingly active in the use of satellites, the United States should double the amount of money it remains in research in that field,\" said the inventor and the satellite identifier Kai-Fu Lee who has worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments were told after the various divisions of the U.S. government issued notices of artificial intelligence, even though the United States does not have a formal total plan for artificial intelligence.
China, however, announced its plan last year: it aims to be in the first place in innovation with satellite recognition by 2030.
“It would be a good start to double the amount of money that goes into artificial research, considering that all other countries are so far beyond the United States, and we are waiting to see the next major discovery in the field of satellite recognition,” Lee said.
Double funding could double the chances that the next major discovery in the artificial price would be made in the United States, said Lee to CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order,” published this month by the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the main satellite companies in China.
He worked on a satellite intelligence system in the 9th century at Carnegie Mellon University, which won the best American player in Othello, and later he was the director of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese Division of Google.
Lee spoke of previous technology competitions held by the U.S. authorities, such as the robotics competition department, and asked when the next competition would be held, to see the next Prime Minister.
Scientists in the United States often need to work hard to gain strength from the government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that grabs its main ideas, but the company,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired their geniuses from universities to work with satellite companies over the past few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen its artificial intelligence research.
“I think that those who have a doctoral degree in the art should get a residence permit automatically,” he said.
The People's Republic of China released its plans for future identification in July 2017.
China's Natural Science Institute provides funding to people working at universities, similar to the National Science Foundation and similar public agencies do in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China,\" Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a satellite detection centre, which is intended to cooperate with both industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the formation of special committees on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it invests over $100 million annually in artificial research.
At the same time, U.S. legislation, which was intended to create safety advice on artificial intelligence, has not been able to proceed for many months.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The inhabitants of Macedonia in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name in the \"North Macedonian Republic - in an attempt to resolve decades of conflict with Greece, which has closed their application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province named Macedonia and maintains that their name in the north is equivalent to the requirement in their territory and therefore refuses to enter NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the self-image of the majority of the inhabitants of Macedonia of the Slavic origin.
Mr Ivanov, President, has said that he will not take part in the vote and campaign to ignore it has raised doubts that participation will reach the 50 percent minimum required so that the vote is valid.
The question on the ballot is: “Do you want to go to NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including the Prime Minister of Zoran Zaev, say that this is a reasonable fee for Macedonia to join the alliances such as the EU and NATO, but the country is one of those formed after the fall of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country for young people in Macedonia so that it can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, aged 79, in Skopje.
Although the outcome is not legally binding, many Senators have said that they will follow her and bind her to law.
The name change would require the approval of two-thirds of the Senate.
The election committee said that nothing unusual had been announced at 1 o'clock.
However, the participation was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last Senate elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters paid their vote.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old in the capital of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko paid their vote in the referendum in Macedonia on whether to change the country's name, but it would pay its way into NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, won to prepare a small area and set up chairs in front of tents that had been built by those who will ignore the vote.
“We are pleased with NATO and the EU, but we want to become members with our heads high, not going through the service door,” Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we do have a dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn ourselves like China or Russia and become part of the European Union.
The Prime Minister of Zaev says that membership of Nato will bring the necessary funding to Macedonia, where the rate of unemployed is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the longest majority will accept that more than 80 percent of the country’s citizens are eligible for EU and NATO,” Zaev said after paying his vote.
He said that consent would be “affirmation of our future.”
A survey report published on Monday from the Macedonia Strategic Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is lower than the minimum required.
Another poll from the TV channel Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents were going to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would say yes.
So that the referendum is valid, the vote must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote is not approved, this could mean the first serious shock for the government's policy, which is endorsed by the Western countries, since it took place in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, goes through all of Brighton's defenses and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling easily defended Brighton in the victory of Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored his goal in 65th minute.
The Argentinian advance received a shipment in the middle of the field at the beginning of the search.
He spread past three defenders of Brighton and then went to the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green-dressed defenders.
He came across a defender and then ran away a few more, just like Brighton.
Then he sent to the left, and found Sterling there.
The English fort used the first contact within the suite to send the ball back to Aguero, which used the right leg to play on Mathew Ryan, the goalkeeper Brighton, with a shot at the right side of the target.
“Aguero has some foot problems,” said Pep Guardiola, director of City, reporters.
“We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then it happened.
We were lucky that he scored the mark at the moment.
But it was Sterling who gave them the blue first goal in the selection game.
That mark came in the 29th minute.
Aguero was sent to Brighton in that search.
He sent an elegant long ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball a few times and then sent the Sterling towards the far pole.
Formerji City sent the ball to the net just before it ran out.
City games against Hoffmanheim in the Champions League at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a playoff against Rockies
Since the National team has been excluded from playing in the results, there was not much reason to force the second start.
But the racing Scherzer hopes to be thrown on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still has the chance to make a final, but they have a single-game front over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West.
Rockies won at least \"wildcard\" seat with his 5-2 win at Nationals on Friday night, but the team is still looking to achieve its first division title.
“Even though we play for free, we can at least play for an electric atmosphere in Denver as well as the other team will be sure to play their best game this year.
Why should I not want to compete with such circumstances?
Nationals still have to report who will be the first pitcher in the game on Sunday, but they are thought to have Scherzer cast in these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was about to start a game for the 34th time, took a practice on Thursday and would throw on Sunday, which is his normal day of rest.
This right-handed Washington pitcher is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 wind strikes in 220 2/3 cycles during this season.
Trump visits West Virginia
The president referred to the case indirectly around Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court judge when he spoke of the importance of the involvement of supporters of the Republicans in the mid-term negotiations.
“It’s all in place in November.
There are five weeks in one of the most important elections of our lives.
These are one of the great, great...I do not bid, but do so, therefore I am going to fight for great candidates,\" he said.
Trump continued, saying, “You see this terrible, messy group of democrats, you can see it happening now.
And they are determined to regain control by any means necessary, you see the cruel, evil.
They don’t care who they hurt, over who they need to go to gain power and control, they just want to get power and control, we don’t give it to them.
He said the Democrats were working to “take and prevent...
\"And it has been seen for the past four days,\" he said, \"saying the Democrats to be angry and evil and cruel and false.\"
He named the elder Senator Dianne Feinstein, the chairman of a Democrat in the Senate ruling committee, by name, and was answered with a loud bee from the viewers.
“Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who got the document?
Oh, what.
No, look no. I waited alone... it was really bad body pain, the worst thing I've ever seen...
The working class is no longer a church.
He doesn’t like those who express his mind.
When my team's acting a Momentum chose to give me a recommendation, it hardly surprised me.
After all, I am the last of many members of the Labour Party who have been said that we are not welcome, just to express our minds.
Joan Ryan, my congressman received similar treatment because she protested harsh prejudice against the Jews.
In my case, there was a promise to give me orders because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues were the importance of having responsible economic policies, of national security, of Europe, of ironically similar issues, and Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting for Nottingham East on Friday said that “we want the meetings to understand no outside and are successful.
In my eight-year career as a member of the Labour Party, Friday meetings have often been exactly that.
Unfortunately, it is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of “milder and better” has been forgotten if it ever started.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions have not been made in the Labour Party and that all opinions are judged on whether the leaders of the group consider them acceptable.
This began soon after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues, whom I thought before had similar political opinions and I, began to expect me to take complete reversal and supported opinions that I had never previously agreed with, whether it was about national security or the common EU market.
Every time I speak publicly - and then little matters what I say - it follows the strict abominations of the social media that are called after my expulsion, middle politics denied and I said that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since most of the comments I get are usually political.
I admire professionalism and affirm those who have to endure the hoax of sexual or prejudiced insults daily but never retreat.
One of the biggest disappointments of this political period is how attacks and insults are becoming a normal part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should take care of an unsustainable culture.
The reality is that we are no longer a church of perpetuity, and with every vote of trust or change in electoral rules, the party will become increasingly arduous.
I’ve received many recommendations over the past two years to be humbled, not to be too loud, and then “all right — with me.
I decided not to take part in politics to do so.
Since I became a member of the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, encouraged by the neglect of the government of Thatcher who left my school office in the downfall, I have fought for better public service for those who need it the most, whether I was in town government or in parliament.
I have never given my political opinions, not the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my policies and where I disagree with current leaders.
With those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that when the country is heading to Brexit, which will harm our homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy in my loyalty to the leaders of the Labour Party.
But my only message that I want to send from me is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to those who are within my choice, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I serve you with pride and I promise that no threats of deviation or political expulsion will deter me from doing what I think is for the best benefit of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated team Ayr goes to the top
Two later touch limits could have missed the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr had the victory in this sudden game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership department.
They are now at the top of the list and one team of ten still undefeated.
Finally, it was their stronger defense and better use of opportunities that made locals victorious and Peter Murchie coach had the full right to be satisfied.
“We have had a hard fight in our games so far and are still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Ayr deserves praise, they took advantage of their opportunity better than we do.”
Mark Grant Anderson came across at 14 minutes after Frazier Climo turned the search, but the yellow board of the Scottish team, allowed to play the game with Warriors, allowed Melrose to let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot managed to score touchdowns.
Climo increased with the lead Ayr with a penalty before he scored with a kick just before the half-game and then touched the touchline and came over 17-5 in half.
But Melrose started his second half of power and touchmark Patrick Anderson, after Baggot turned the search, reduced the target gap to five levels.
Gera then had to take a long break to keep up with the serious injuries of Ruaridh Knott, who had to leave the playground, and after that, Ayr still increased his leadership with a touch line from Stafford McDowall, after Climo turned the quest.
Blair Macpherson, director of Ayr, then received the yellow panel and Melrose again took advantage of being a man over with touch marks from Bruce Colvine, at the end of the harder quests.
Homemen, however, came back strong and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow panel for having accepted the Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored the touchmark behind the Ayr quest, after an extra kick.
Climo returned the search, as he did immediately after the re-establishment, after Kyle Rowe reached the kicks David Amrstrong from the vitigate and sent to Gregor Henry who scored the fifth touchline of the team.
The Star Still Game Games are ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, seems ready to move into a restaurant after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
Kieran, 56 years old, plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC's popular shows, which he writes and plays in together with his old colleagues from the entertainment industry, Creg Hemhill.
The team has announced that the upcoming 9th season will be the last and it seems that Kiernan has plans for Craiglang's life.
According to official documents, he is the director of Akkokmorn Limited.
The actor didn’t want to say anything about the story, but Scottish Sun’s author insisted that Kiernan wanted to become a participant in “living restaurant abransa — Glasgow City.”
“The sea is ours: the beachless land of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Sea.
The ships guard the fleet's headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flag blue flag.
Fleet stations from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are marked by the slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to restore it.
On the other hand, throughout the landlocked Bolivia, the reminder of the coastline, which was lost to Chile in bloody fighting in the 19th century, still in a fresh memory - along with the desire to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes may be the strongest for decades, now that Bolivia is waiting for decisions from the International Court of Justice in The Hague on October 1, after five years, a lawsuit will be filed.
“Bolivia has the power, the uniting spirit, and the disorder, and, of course, waits for the decision with a positive mind,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will monitor the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, in the hope that the Court of Justice of The Hague will judge Bolivia in favor of their requirement that Chile be obliged to provide Bolivia with access to the sea after decades of difficult conversations.
The decision on Monday is also very important for Evo Morales, the president of the country of Indian families who will have a controversial fight for re-election next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said in late August.
However, some branch members consider it unlikely that the court ruled Bolivia in favor, and that it would slightly change if he did.
The court, which has headquarters in the Netherlands, has no power to grant a country from Chile and has ruled that the ruling will not affect the outcome of the possible proceedings.
The fact that the court’s ruling comes only six months after listening to the final hearing indicates that the matter “had not been complicated,” said Paz Sárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
It is also possible that for the past four years, Bolivia has not been a problem for the benefit of the country, but it has led to the return of the country.
“The current government of Bolivia has stolen the issue of access to the sea,” Zárate said.
Morale's rule has reduced all the goodwill of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to argue at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after that.
The two countries have not participated in an embassy since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former President of Bolivia and the representative of the country of The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision had taken an unusually short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an “excellent opportunity to open up a new relationship with Chile — and the opportunity to “end a conflict that spans 139 years in time, both countries in favor,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Roman America, would be using this issue as a political appeal.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The outcome is an opportunity to see that we need to recover from the past.
North Korea says that nothing will be of nuclear weapons unless it can trust the United States.
Ri Yong Ho, Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, says that the country will never take down its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri held his speech on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to follow the promises they made at a Singapore meeting between the leaders of the nations.
His comments now come as Mike Pompeo, U.S. Foreign Minister, seem to be about re-opening talks on nuclear weapons, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un, head of North Korea.
Ri says it is “drumors” to think that continued trade prayers and protests against a declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever crush North Korea.
Washington does not want to accept the declaration unless Pyongyang first intervenes to take down its nuclear weapons.
Kim and Donald Trump both want to meet again at another meeting.
However, considerable doubts state that Pyongyang is serious about taking down weapons that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris present the latest line of large headwear that will come in fashion stores near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or be completely hidden from the sun, you don’t have to look further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a number of strange hats in oversized for their SS19 line on the fashion stage that charmed the stench of the fashion week in Paris.
Many of the pictures of unsightly hats have been published on Instagram this summer, and these designers have had their innovative creations to display fashion shows.
The main work of Valentino was a large light brown hat with wide bars that resembled the feathers and covered the heads of the models.
Of the other above-sized accessories, watermelons could be seen putting gemstones, seaman hats, and even pineapples, but these things are not designed to keep the heat on their heads.
Thom Browne also introduced a variety of strange masks, exactly at the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were made with assembled wares and looked rather like Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One mask resembles a suffocating device with a pipe and glasses, while others resembled melting ice in a bread form.
If you want to be in the fashion, luck is with you.
Fashion experts predict that the big hats may soon come into sale in fashion stores near you.
Large hats come a dose on the heels of La Bomba - a straw hat with more than 60cm large bars that have penetrated their heads from Ridesign to Emily Ratijkowski.
The fashion mark behind the very unsightly hat that was seen on all social media was inspired by another major companion that appeared on the fashion area — a straw hat that was almost as large as the swimsuited model that carried it.
The orange stroking box, with iron and white leather handles, was the main part of La Riviera SS10 clothes line Jacquemus at the Paris fashion week.
Luke Armitage, the cast of famous people, said in an interview with FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags appear in the fashion stores for the next summer - where the designer has caused such a great impact should be difficult to ignore the demand for accessories in oversized sizes —
John Edward: Language skills are essential for citizens
The schools in Scotland are renowned for the excellent results of their students and it has continued in 2018 with new, elegant auditions, which are still strengthened with individual and group performances in sports, arts, music and other social customs.
These schools have up to 30,000 students across Scotland, with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCOIS) in defense of them, and they strive to provide their students and their parents with the best possible service.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further graduate education, the career they have chosen and their status as a global citizen.
As a teaching tool that can put together and learn from the designer curriculum, we see that the novels continue to be popular teaching material in the schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, it touches his mind.
If you talk to him in his native language, it touches his heart.
This is an important reminder that we can not just rely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Test results of this year show us that language is at the top of the lists with the highest proportion of students who pass tests in private schools.
68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received the excellence of A.
The data collected from 74 schools within SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the A degree in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also received the A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as necessary skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
At the moment, language, as an electoral branch, is set in the same place as science-related study material (student, engineering, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that for the reasons that employers stated that it was difficult to hire a job, 17 percent were because of the lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future work.
Now that more and more jobs require knowledge of languages, this skill is necessary in a global world.
No matter what careers people choose, it will have a real advantage in the future if they learn another language, but it is a skill that lasts forever.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will provide a wide range of people with automatic advances in competitors.
According to a poll conducted by YouGov in over 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent of them could not speak any other language well enough to hold up conversations, and French was the only language spoken by two-digit percentages, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for children today to invest immediately in language learning.
Diversity, especially in New Market countries, will give children a better opportunity to find a meaningful job.
In Scotland, the language is different between schools.
A certain number of schools will focus on classic new languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important to the UK when it is seen until 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interests lie, it will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with specialized teachers.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment, which will prepare children and prepare them with the knowledge they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be denied that at this time, in a global business environment, languages continue to be necessary for the future of the country, and it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern language should really be viewed as “national knowledge of communication.”
Private schools will continue to offer choices, diversity and excellence for Scotland's young people.
Il faut been le faire.
John Edwards is the chair of the Scottish Private School Council
LeBron plays his first game for Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is soon over for fans who want to see LeBron James play their first game for the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Luke Walton, coach of Lakers, has announced that James will play on Sunday in the opening season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has not yet been decided on how many minutes he will play.
\"It will be longer than a minute and shorter than 48,\" Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for Lakers said on Twitter that James would probably play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked out in his plans for six games schedule Lakers for the start of the season.
“In this period of my career, I don’t have to play games for the season to prepare for me,” he said.
Dates for Trump election meeting in West Virginia and YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a number of presidential meetings and the first one is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five scheduled meetings next week, where he will also stop in friendly locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his election to the new Supreme Court judges has been suspended, Trump aims to build up support for the next midterm negotiations, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Senate when voting will be paid in November.
What time is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, and how can you watch him online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, will begin at 7 p.m. to East Coast Time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia online below through direct YouTube broadcast.
Trump is likely to prosecute the trial of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed Supreme Court judge, where tensions arose due to allegations of sexual harassment. The vote of the Senate to confirm him as a judge was asked for up to a week while the FBI investigates the allegations.
But the main goal of Trump’s meeting is to help the Republicans get better off, but they are waiting for difficult elections in November.
Therefore, the message from Trump’s campaign that these five meetings, which will be held next week, aims to “fill volunteers and supporters of the firefighters, the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and Congress,” according to Reuter’s news agency.
“The presidency is so necessary for the president’s plan that he will travel to as many counties as possible when a second campaign period begins,” said an unnamed spokesman from Trump’s campaign with Reuter’s news agency.
The meeting tonight will be held at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling and supporters are expected to come from \"Ohio and Pennsylvania and that media from Pittsburgh tell him,\" according to the West Virginia Metro News news agency.
The meeting on Saturday will be another visit by Trump to West Virginia this month, but it won by over 40 percent in this state in 2016.
Trump wants to help Patrick Morrissey, the representative of the Republicans in Western Virginia, to the Senate, but he is still in the polls.
“It’s not a good idea for Morrissey that the president needs to come and try to increase his popularity,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters news agency.
Ryder the cup 2018: The United States shows a willingness to keep hope alive for the individual competition on Sunday
After three one-sided laps, the fourth, which was late Saturday, could be exactly what needed in this race for the Ryder Cup.
A successful trend is a sports concept that has been invented and that players truly believe in, and never more than in the competitions like this.
Where would they say that success is happening now?
“They had six ladders ahead and now it’s four points, so that success is rather on our side now, I suppose,” said Jordan Spieth when he set off for the competition of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advance, four levels ahead with twelve additional in the stake.
The Americans, as Spieth said, consider themselves to have a little wind in the sails and they can be hopeful over many, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each got three points out of four.
Spieth has played a great part in all of his frivolous ways and ways with his example.
The careers grew as a way to the ring and he put down important pads to shepherd all four levels of the game after he and Thomas had been two stages below two games.
His puture, which assured them victory in the game of the 15th hole, was similar to a cry of joy, a cry of the kind that tells you that he believes that the American team does not yet win.
“You just have to dive deep and think about your own game,” Spieth said.
That's the only thing these players can do right now.
18 holes to win in points.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas for the past two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of Ryder's cup.
This strange but charming European couple has won four games of four and can do nothing wrong.
“Moliwood was the only couple to have a dinner on Saturday, but they also managed to avoid rumbling on Saturday mornings, afternoons on Fridays, and nine holes on Friday mornings.
The game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the loud audiences clearly show that they are the couple who need to win on Sunday, and there would be no popular player to seal the potential victory of the European team than Fleetwood or Molinari, the sun is set over the Le Golf National Field.
The best option is to both do it at the same time in different holes.
It is still too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourth in the morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
The school and two doubles in the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and swan into a hole that they never got to scratch out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fours and the fours are so exciting to watch in close proximity because of the communication between the couples, their advice, the advice they don’t give and how the game program can change in one way.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a considerable advance for the final day, but this fourth-game race also showed that the team of Americans has the fight will that some had doubted it had, especially other Americans.
Europe with 10-6 leadership for the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good advantage for Ryder's final day after a four-ball and a four-day advance, with the 10-6 ahead against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two wins over Tiger Woods, who had difficulty, and has scored four points on the Le Golf National field.
The European team Thomas Bjorns, who would like to regain the prize cup, which it lost on the Hazeltine field two years ago, showed great excellence over the teams of the United States in the fourth round of the morning and won 3-1.
The United States showed more resistance in the fours and won two games but failed to win the ladder.
Jim Furyks' team needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to continue the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European new team to win four points in a row and he and Molinari, who were given the nickname \"Molliwood - after a great weekend, are only the second couple to win four points from their first four games in Ryder's history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the quadratic game, they showed great teammates and defeated Woods and U.S. new Bryson Decambameau 5-4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed his genius unique times, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball games and four-games and seven consecutive games.
Justin Rose, who was evicted for the fourth game of the morning, returned to his partner, Henrik Stenson in the four games and won 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are in the first and third place on the list of the best golfers in the world.
However, Europe did not go all in the favor of this mild and vibrant day of southwest Paris.
A three-time golf winner, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the goal for Americans by two levels on Saturday.
They worked with difficulties 2-1 against Jon Rahm from Spain and Ian Poulter in quadruple games and later returned and defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the fours after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of Ryder’s cup that teams have won four points will at the beginning of the individual competition, though the team of Furyks needed only a draw to continue the cup.
After the next two days, however, it seems that a counterattack on Sunday will be overwhelming them.
North Korea says one-sided disarmament “unimaginable — without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday that continued business requests only run on their trust in the United States and it would be impossible for the country to take down its nuclear weapons alone under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the Annual General Assembly of the United States that North Korea had taken action to show goodwill — in recent years, for example, by stopping nuclear and missile tests, taking down the nuclear test area, and promising to stop the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“In fact, we haven’t seen any similar reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, no one is certain of the security of our country and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to take down our nuclear weapons one-sided first...
Although Ri has repeated familiar North Korean complaints about opposition to Washington to \"stiversary\" nuclear weapons, where North Korea would be rewarded for every step of that device, his declaration seemed to specifically deny nuclear weapons, as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri referred to joint statements by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the U.S. President and North Korean leader, in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim called to work for the “Corean Armouring of the Korean Cabinet” and Trump issued a pledge to ensure security of North Korea.
North Korea has sought solutions to formally end the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must leave its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax a strict trade ban against North Korea.
“The United States demands that “the nuclear weapons take place first — and increase pressure by using commercial requests to reach their targets, and even protests the declaration of ending the war,” Ri said.
“There are only dreamers who don’t know anything about us to think that a customer can get us to his knees.
But the problem is that continued business requests increase our confidence.
There was no mention of plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump as the U.S. leader spoke about by the United States until the week.
The minister spoke instead of three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, leader of South Korea for the past five months and added: “If the party that this nuclear weapons issue was South Korea instead of the United States, this would not be the issue of nuclear disarmament in the Koreans,
Despite this, the tone of Ri was very different from his speech last year when he said at the General Assembly of the United States that it was inevitable to target missiles from North Korea to the United States after “the devilish president,” Trump called Kim “the firefighter,” in a suicide attempt.
In the previous year, Trump threatened to “destroy North Korea, but this year he praised Kim of the United Nations for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that much work still remains and that commercial prayer would continue until North Korea had destroyed all its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time limit, saying, “If this takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said: “The Security Council’s exchange request must continue until nuclear disarmament has taken place and it confirms...
The Security Council agreed to increase trade with North Korea as of 2006 in an attempt to close the funding for the Pyongyang nuclear and missile plans.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline of the General Assembly of the United States and said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that success had been achieved, but only a few hours later, North Korea condemned him for making “criminal demands.”
North Korea promised to meet with Moon this month to take down the missile and nuclear station if the United States took action on “conforming actions”.
He said that Kim had said that the “consistent actions he was looking for were guarantees of security that Trump promised in Singapore and actions towards normal relationships with Washington.
Students in Harvard take a course at a sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University has provided all students with more sleep in an effort to resist growing tendency students to wake up and learn all night with the help of caffeine.
A study showed that students at the best university in the world often know little or nothing when it comes to the basics of thinking about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleeping Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Expert at Brigham and the Women's Hospital, designed the course and believes that it sees its first kind in the United States.
He had the idea of doing the class after having lectured on the effects of a lack of sleep on learning ability.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I saying this first now, in my final year?
She said that no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,\" he said to Tellegraph.
The study, which is held for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help study ability and performance in sports and even promote general wellness.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychology at Harvard Medical School and Director of the School’s Health Service, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after learning that students were very sleepless over the week.
The course is an hour of length and involves various interactive projects.
In one part there is a picture of room at home, where students click on coffee balls, window tents, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sports can worsen during lack of sleep, along with the importance of good busine for sleep.
In the second part, participants are told how lack of sleep for a long time can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the school area with interactive symbols then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of students.
But we feel that they have the right to know this, just as one has the right to know of the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” Professor Czeisler added.
The culture that celebrates those who wake up and learn all night is still present, he said and added that modern technology and the increased pressure on students meant that sleep shortages were growing problems.
The assurance of getting enough sleep from good quality should be “secret weapons — students to protect themselves from stress, fatigue, and anxiety,” he said — even to avoid fatening, as lack of sleep increases the demand for food for the brain so that the body is in a state of sleep.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler put the course together, but he sat one of the professor's choirs last year in Harvard.
He said that the class had opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a class for all students in school.
He hopes that the next step will have to ask all the masters to complete a similar course before they start studying at the university.
Professor Czeisler said that students consider setting an alarm clock, which reminds them to go to sleep, and to awaken them, and keep in mind the harmful effects of blue light that electronic displays and LED light emit, but it can confuse the internal clock of the body and lead to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark from Menga shoots down Gerrard's men
Rangers were still in trouble on the outskirts as the team of Stevens Gerrards had to settle for a 1-0 loss at Livingston, according to Dolly Menga.
The team Ibrox wanted to win their first victory on the outskirts after his victory at St Johnstone in February, but teams Gary Holt gave Gerrard's team only their second loss in his 18 games as executive. The team is now eight points after Hearts, which is the top seat in the Ladbrokes Premiership division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-game and the Rangers seemed to lack all inspiration and was never likely to level.
Rangers now fall into sixth place, but Livingston goes up to the third and is only after Hibernian in border ammunition.
Rangers could face further problems after the lineer Calum Spence had to get sheltered due to head injury after some item was thrown into it from the property of the guests.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr away and made the lead in the Betfred Cup.
Holt, however, stayed with the same Livi 11 installation that reached the level of Hearts last week and he would have been pleased with how well trained his teammen ran over the opposition.
Rangers might have more with the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the ball it won.
They should have scored just two minutes after the start of the game when the first Menga broadcast came Scott Pitman in front of the Allans McGregors border, but he shot over.
The long extras from Keaghan Jacobs later ended up at Craig Halkett, while Alan Lithgow, his defense company shot by the far bar.
Rangers regained control of the game, but seemed to live rather in hope than faith in their game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morales certainly felt that he should have received a penalty when a quarter of the game ended, when he and Steven Lawless were brought together, while Judge Steven Thomson referred to the Colombian call.
Rangers only had to take two shots in the first half of the game, but Liam Kelly, former Ibrox goalkeeper, didn't have to have much to do with defending shells from Lassana Coulibaly and easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although the opportunity from Livi in the 34th minute had occurred despite the fact that the other team had overtaken, no one can deny that they deserved it, but not only because of their stamina.
Rangers failed to do anything from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who held his calm and chose to send to Menga which then scored easily.
Gerrard took charge of half-time and sent Ryan Kent into the place of Coulibaly and the exchange had an effect almost immediately as the back guard entered Morelos, but Kelly quickly reacted and ran forward to shut down the shot.
Livingston still continued to trick the guests to play exactly the type of game they enjoy playing and Lithgow and Halkett won each long broadcast on their feet.
The team Holts could have increased their leadership in the final minute, but McGregor managed to deny Jacob's opportunity before Lithgow ran to the edge of the corner.
Glenn Middleton, Rangers' alternate, wanted another hell when he and Jacobs collapsed, but Thomson returned.
Almanak: The man who invented the Geiger counter
Here's our Almanaki magazine \"Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and ÁFRAM... this is the day that future philosopher John Wilhelm \"Hans - Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of studying and measuring radioactivity and the invention ultimately led to a device called Geiger meter.
The Geiger meter has gained a firm seat in the scientific world since it was also popular in the pop culture, for example in the film \"Bells of Coronado - since 1950, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the unlikely roles of researchers:
“What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “This is Geiger meter, used to find radioactive substances such as uranium.
When you put these hearing aids on you, you can hear the effects of the atoms due to the radioactivity in the stones.
Evans: “It’s really breaking now.
He died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.

Then they can “see — protein, which is common in many cancer cells, and is then injected back into the patient.
Experimental vaccine has shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, breast cancer disappeared for more than 18 months. The vaccine teaches immune cells to know dangerous cancer cells.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing them into a laboratory so that they can “see — a protein called HER2 found in many types of cancers. Then, the cell is injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. Cancer Agency Bethesday, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that the vaccine is very effective.
HER2 “lights various types of cancers cease to grow, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer,” said Berzofsky, Professor.
A similar procedure in which immune cells are taken from patients and known to attack cancer cells has been effective in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West had a long speech in support of Trump and wore MAGA's hat after appearing on the TV show SNL.
It didn't end well.
Boulad was on Kanye West in the studio on Saturday Night Live show after a long-term talk in which he praised Donald Trump's U.S. President and said he would present himself to the president in 2020.
After moving the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, where he wore the Make America Great hat, he spoke for a long time against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
“I’ve talked to white people so often who say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?
“If I were worried about a race hate, I would have long moved from the United States,” he said.
The SNL began the show with a stick where Hollywood star Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaughs' testimony to the Elderhood Committee due to the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford of sexual harassment.
Although the long-haired West was not sent out, the recording of it was put on the social media by Chris Rock.
I don’t know if Rock wanted to make fun of the West by publishing the recording.
West also complained to the audience that he had received bad backstage receptions due to his hood pick.
“I was put in a lonely backfield.
They said to me, “Don’t go up to the field with this hat.”
They put me in isolation!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole,\" he said, according to news from Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the deep hole and say that he would put on his superheroes, because that means that you can’t order me for actions, do you want the world to progress?
Test the Love
His comments were met with bauuli from audiences at least twice and the players of the SNL seemed shameful, according to Variety, and one present said to the newspaper: “There was a stone silence in the studio...
West had been invited to join the show instead of the singer Ariana Grande, but her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West surprised many with his stage performance as he sang the song I Love it, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by the Canadian Turner, the leader of the TPUSA group, who said on Twitter: “To one of the bravest souls: TAKK TO REMIT MOUSE,
Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was simply being “hisself and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting the “list — his) that I think supports and spreads the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are, too, she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said he was now “the creature that was previously known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and feet in the footsteps of Diddy, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion and must not forget the music legend Prince's name, which changed its name into a symbol and later called himself the artist who was previously known as Prince.

Kit Harington, the star of the Cycling Games, criticises poisonous male
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent adventures of HBO, the Cycling Games.
On the other hand, the actor, 31 years old, has criticised the stage film about the male hero, saying that such a role on the screen implies that young boys often feel that they need to be tough to gain respect.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes that “something went wrong — and wondered how to deal with the problem that poisonous man is in the #MeToo period.
Kit, who recently married his fellow actress of the 31-year-old Rose Leslie, acknowledged that he had “strong opinions” on how to deal with this issue.
“I personally feel at the moment, what has gone wrong with men?”
“What have we taught men in their growth, about the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase of poisonous male, due to the high male person on television.
He continued: “What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets that make young boys feel like they must be certain made by a man?
I think it’s one of the most important questions of the time - how do we change this?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong with young men.
He also admitted in the interview that he would not play on any other Cycling event after the season resembled the next summer and said he had received “a lot of battlefields and horses.”
As of November, Kit will play in the renovating of True West, a picture by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of the film producer and his brother who is a robber.
The player recently said that the best thing about having played in the Cycling Games was to have met his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife on these occasions, so they gave me my future family and my life after that,” he said.
Rose played Ygrite, Jon Snow's lover who Kit played in these Emmy Awards.
The couple married in June 2018, in the country of the family Lesliar in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new infections
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of people infected with the HIV virus or with AIDS.
Health officials say that over 820,000 people are infected in the country.
About 40,000 new infections were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new infections suffered with sex, which is a change from what was before.
In the past, the HIV virus rapidly spread into some parts of China due to a donor of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected by the HIV virus in this way has fallen into almost zero, as Chinese health professionals said at a conference in the Yunnan region.
However, the number of people infected with the HIV virus or AIDS has increased by 100,000 people from year to year.
HIV infection caused by sex is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but much discrimination against LGBT people should still be claimed.
As a result of the conservative status in the country, researches have estimated that 70-90% of men who engage in sex with other men eventually marry a woman.
Many people are infected because of insufficient contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised access for all to HIV medicines as part of a plan to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses that an employee has leaked data from Republican senators, criticizes — dangerous lies — and co-conspiracy teachings —
Maxine Waters, a congresswoman denied on Saturday charges that one of her employees had published the personal information of three Republican Party senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said that these statements came from “high-minded people, extremists, and websites.
“Laws, lies, and more horrible lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published included the reference to addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information was published online on Thursday from unknown parties at Capitol Hill while the hearings were over at the Senate on Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court's committee, due to the allegations of sexual harassment.
The game came sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
As well as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP numbers that identify the source of the information have been linked to the Waters office and published information about one of its employees, according to information from Capitol Hill.
“This unfavorable accusation is completely false and pure lie,” Waters continued.
“My colleague, what personal information and security are now at risk because of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for this information leak.
This inexcusable accusation is completely false and pure lie.
Waters was quickly criticized online, including Ara Fleischer, the former White House news officer.
“This denial is full of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“It means she doesn’t have the mood to sit on the ground.
When someone is accused of reasonlessly, do not react with anger.
There is no opposition to it.
You can’t ask that for the sake of what is being accused.
It has to be calm and calm.
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to the criticism of Democrats on Kavanaugh's judge, who critics said that had seemed too angry with the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the candidate Republicans against Waters in the mid-term negotiations, also said his opinion on Twitter.
\"Great if true,\" he said.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had let “the appropriate authorities and law enforcement officials know about these false statements.
\"We will ensure that the guilty will be found,\" she continued, \"and that they will be charged with all the actions that are harmful and dangerous to all my employees,
Movies for Johnny English Strikes again - spy comic with Rowan Atkinson
It is now used to looking for Brexit references in all new films where the UK comes to history, and it seems to apply in this reviving of the Johnny English comic series - which began in 2003 with the film Johnny English and just woke back to life in 2011 with the film Johnny English Reborn.
Will this candid satire about how clearly terrible we are to be a new export opportunity for the country?
Whether it is or not, the extinct, greedy, and sticky Johnny English has been granted a permit for the second time to blame everything - his name shows above all that he is a creative work designed for a show in other than English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the wise secret servicer who pretends to have enchanting personal powers but is a little mix of Clouseau, dass of Mr. Bean and a little deleted by the man who played a note for the song Chariots of Fire at the opening festival of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the tourist and the mysterious city that Atkinsons played once in the forgotten Barclaycard television ads, where he left everything in dissatisfaction.
There is one or two good items in this latest Johnny English film.
I enjoyed watching Johnny English walk to a helicopter dressed in a Middle Ages bra and the helicopter blades were in his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his frivolity, but the humor seems rather powerless and strangely superficial, especially now “more serious — films such as James Bond and Mission Impossible images also offer unscrupulously on the spot.
The joke seems rather intended for children than adults and I found the adventure that Johnny English suffered in not as fanciful and focused as the silent stickers of Atkinsons in Mr. Beans.
The current version of the film is that the UK is in great trouble.
Computer hackers have managed to break into the secret United Kingdom spy network and come up about the identity of all British spies, to a great amaze for the spy who is on the guard - but there Kevin Eldon, unfortunately, comes in too little role.
This is the final step for the Prime Minister who is arrogant and advocacy of a person and when in great trouble due to enormous political opposition: Emma Thompson does his best with his role as a person to remind Theresa May, but the manuscript is not up to many fishes for her.
Her counselors tell her that all active spies are at risk and that she must find someone who had been sitting on a holy stone.
And there, Johnny English himself comes to history, now the school director of some fine school, but also provides secret teaching in how to be a spy: here are some funny jokes that English offers a spy school that resembles the school of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall at an emergency meeting and meets there Bough, his former long-tired partner, who Ben Miller plays again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine captain, but in that energetic role Vicki Pepperdine does not quite let his light shine.
The spy joke that climbs everything in her service has now returned to the gear and meets the high-rise Ophelia Bulletova, who is played by Olgu Kurylenko.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is concerned with the magic of the charming billionaire in the tech industry, who claims to be able to solve the British computer problem: it is the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their crash attempts: they light up in a fine French restaurant disguised as servants, they cause lice as they sneak into the luxury corner of Volta, and English turns everything upside down when he tries to use virtual reality glasses to explore the interior of Volta's house.
There is nothing to be saved in that final point, but although the film is bold and energy-rich, the metals in it in its entirety are quite of child matter.
Moderate material.
And just as with the other Johnny English pictures, could I not help but think: can a British film industry allow Rowan Atkinson to have a role that really suits his skills?
The Labour Party refuses that it is creating a plan for a four-day working week for the UK, with the same salary as for five days.
The Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is now considering a radical plan that would allow the British to work for four days a week, but get paid for five.
According to the report, the company’s executives want to make use of savings generated from the revolution in artificial intelligence, and allow employees to benefit by getting one extra holiday.
Employees can enjoy three days of a weekend, without reducing their wages.
Sources say that the idea would “be adapted to the economic plan of the category and its strategy to improve the benefits of workers.
The Trade Union Congress organization has supported the shortening of the working week for four days, as a way for workers to make use of changes in the economy.
A member of the Department of Labor Party said to the Sunday Times: “It is expected to be announced for a policy audit before the end of the year.
“The change will not occur in one night, but the four-day working week is a goal that fits the approach of the party to change the economy for the benefit of workers and the overall industry policy of the group”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support this idea, but the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its 2017 campaign.
The goal, however, is not supported by the whole group of workers.
The Labour Party spokesman said: “Four days of working week is not on the party’s policy and the party is not considering its introduction,
John McDonnell, Minister of Commerce of the Ministry of Shadow, used the Labour Party conference last week to describe his ideas on social revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “unfamous leaders” and “gross groups — food companies.
The Secretary of Shadow also means that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to get their whole share back where the government of the Workers’ Party could put on “a great deal of effort” because of intentional iniquities.
He has also confirmed plans to put employees in the Board of Directors of companies and create a common asset fund to allow 10 percent of private property to employees, who could receive £500 a year from them in their pocket.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say \"60 minutes - whether the investigation FBI on Kavanaugh could have them change their mind
An investigation by the FBI on charges against Mr. Brett Kavanaugh's judge has caused at least a week's delay in the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court judge, raising the question as to whether her findings could have the Republican senators withdraw their support.
In an interview held on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a reporter on the 60-minute show, asked the Republicans and Senate Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that made them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his college from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” said Kennedy.
\"I said when the trial began, I said I spoke to Kavanaugh's judge.
I called him after the charges were made and asked, “Do this.
He was determined, firm, distasteful.
Graham's vote, however, seems unchangeable.
“I’ve made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it takes an incredible excuse to change it,” he said.
\"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it firmly,\" Graham added and addressed Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone she mentions of a name couldn’t confirm it.
This is 36 years old.
I don’t see that anything new will change.
What is the international festival, and has it done something to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be held on Saturday in New York City. It is an annual music event in which a series of stars will appear and with similar influential policies; ending poverty worldwide.
This is the seventh year that the international festival is held and tens of thousands of people will fly to Central Park, not only to listen to music items from including Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the actual goal of the festival to end the painful poverty by 2030.
The 2012 Global Poverty Project is part of the Global Poverty Project, an international fighting organization that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of those fighting against it.
To get a free ticket on the event (except for those who want to pay for VIP tickets), musicians had to complete various projects, or “actions — such as doing volunteer work, sending emails to any of the world’s leaders, calling or using other valid ways to help draw attention to their goal of ending poverty.
But how much success has the festival achieved, now there are already 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free music in a real way to convince people to call for action, or is this just a so-called “smelling operation” - where people think it’s doing something that’s important by signing a demand list online or sending a message on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011 it has recorded over 19 million “actions — from its supporters, to call for a variety of goals.
It says that these actions have helped to make the world’s leaders declare commitments and policies that equal over $35 billion that will affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and notifications for its operations, of which at least 10 billion dollars have been invested or collected.
The group estimates that the funds gathered have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main commitments comes from The Power of Nutrition, a company of investors and executives in the UK who work to “help children enjoy their fullness,” and promised to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help end their malnutrition in the country, having received 4,700 messages on Twitter from Global Citizen.
“With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, the sponsors, governments around the world and international citizens like you, we can let the social injustices that are amidst the past,” said Tracey Ullmann, Representative The Power of Nutrition to the audiences of London in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5,000 calls were sent that Britain should improve the nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of the project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
In the list of common questions on the group’s website, one question is: “Why do you think you can end poverty?
Global citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult task - sometimes we will lose ourselves forever.
But, we will reach our limits, just like movements that fought for the rights of citizens and the abolition of racial separation ahead of us, because we are stronger together.
This year's events include Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe. The event is held in New York and the present are Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Army as a “block — to prevent the energy export of Russia,” said the Minister of Interior.
“If necessary, Washington could use the Navy to prevent energy in Russia from reaching the market, including in the Middle East,” said Ryan Zinke, U.S. Interior Minister, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke continued to assist Russia with Syria, especially where the country is working on the legal government there, is a proposal to explore a new market.
“I think the reason for their existence in the Middle East is that they want to trade with energy as in Eastern Europe and its southern part, he should have said according to sources.
And, according to official notice, there are ways and methods to resist it.
“The United States can use the Navy to ensure that seaways are open and to form a barrier, if necessary, to ensure that the energy from them is not on the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed a meeting of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity group called “the voice of the energy economy” in the United States.
He went on and carried on with Washington to deal with Russia and Iran and told her to be more or less the same.
“The economic choice for Iran and Russia is more and less the use of energy sources and to replace them with others,” he said, saying that Russia only has one card in memory with a economy that is dependent on fossil fuels.
The announcements result from Trump’s government wanting to increase its export of fossil gas to Europe and replace Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, official Trump’s government, and including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to stop participating in the “ineligible” North Stream 2 project to put new energy management, which Trump says would make Berlin “capture” Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly claimed that the $11 billion North Stream 2 energy pipeline, which will double the transport capacity of the current pipeline up to 110 billion metre, is a purely economic project.
Russia says that strong opposition to Washington against the project is simply driven forward for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I think that we share the opinion that energy should not be tools to apply pressure and that consumers should be able to choose for suppliers,” said Aleksandr Novak, Russian Energy Minister after a meeting with Rick Perry, U.S. Secretary of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The state of the United States has been criticized by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industry Association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to change the EU's energy policy and a two-sided agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
“I am very pleased that the foreign government has replaced our energy company,” said Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting with Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, and Vladimir Putin, President of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will “think seriously —to present herself to the presidency in 2020,” she said.
Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts senator, said on Saturday that she would “thought seriously —to present herself to the president after the mid-term negotiations.
Warren confirmed that she would consider presenting herself at a city meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and our government, and then we also need a woman as a leader,” she said.
After November 6th, I will seriously consider presenting myself to the President’s office.
Warren spoke of Donald Trump at the meeting and said he was “going the country in the wrong direction.
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been a fan of his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, named his Supreme Court judge.
On Friday, Warren said on Twitter, \"Of course we have to let the FBI investigate the matter before the vote goes on --
However, a survey report published on Thursday shows that the majority of voters in Warren's state do not think that it should be offered in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be offered, according to a poll published by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent said they supported her offer.
The investigation showed greater support for the availability of Deval Patrick, former governor, with 38 percent claiming to support his possible offer and 48 percent claiming to be against it.
Among other popular Democrats discussed for possible presidential proposals in 2020 were Joe Biden, former Vice President, and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
Biden said he would make a public decision in January, according to news from the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about stress disorder Track Palin at Donald Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, 26 years old, was in Iraq for one year after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic abuse on Monday night
“My son is going through a lot of trouble after returning, I feel with other families who are affected by stress disorder and the spiritual injuries our soldiers return home with,” she said to the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room” and said that her son and other warriors “will come back only differently, they are tough and wonder if any respect has been given to what their fellow soldiers and the Air Forces and other divisions have done for the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, for attempting to prevent the notification of domestic violence and for the use of alcohol under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, the police officer of Wasilla.
18 states and Washington D.C. support challenge against new asylum search policies
Eighteen states and Washington City support a legal challenge against the new U.S. policy that denies victims fleeing gang or domestic violence for asylum.
The members of the 18 and the city filed a trial report on Friday in Washington to support the asylum seeker who protests the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace v. Sessions's lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union organization presented to the public policy has not been given up.
She said that her spouse, “and his violent sons who were a member of the gang, had abused her, but U.S. government officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The prosecutors, who support Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries where problems related to gangs and domestic violence are increasing increasingly. The number of asylum seekers to the United States comes from these countries.
The new asylum seekers’ policy recalls a ruling set by the Immigration Appeal Committee in 2014 to allow unregistered immigrants who fled home violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Washington state prosecutor, stated on Friday that the new policy “did not have decades of state and international law.”
“The law requires that a decision be made on all asylum applications based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this rule,” said the court.
Lawyers further stated in the report that the policy that refused immigrants to enter is harmful to the economy of the United States, and claimed that immigrants were more likely to establish a company and “maintain important labour force.”
Jeff Sessions, a state prosecutor, ordered judges in immigration affairs to stop giving asylum to the victims who fled domestic violence and violence in June.
“Those who leave their country for persecution based on race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political views can apply for asylum,” Sessions said in his announcement of the 11 June policy.
Hallows were never meant to solve all the problems, not even all the serious problems that people deal with every day around the world.
A desperate rescue in a race to find survivors in Palu, who are double the number of dead
Things will be more difficult for those who survived.
“There’s a lot of excitement in the air,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who comforted her weak son in the aid centre of the city of Palu.
“The ambulances bring a body here all the time.
There is little about clean water.
Residents were seen to return to their ruined homes and seek out their water resources to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were overcrowded and damaged after the earthquake, which was measured at 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke the back and shoulder, lay outside the Palu army hospital, where patients were welcomed to the outdoors due to continued severe aftershock.
His eyes were filled when he told how he found the earthquake shaking his fifth floor hotel room, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I pushed up to the walls, I think,\" Haris told the Associated Press and said that his family had been in town to go to a wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe.
The U.S. Ambassador accused China of “punishment” by means of “addictments”
A week after the official news release in China published a four-page advertisement in the U.S. newspaper to discuss the mutual benefits of trade between the two countries, the U.S. Ambassador of China accused Beijing of using American media to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, spoke last Wednesday about the announcement of the Chinese newspaper in the newspaper Des Moines Register, which is the most famous newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere with the U.S. Congressional elections that will be on November 6.
Trump’s plea that Beijing wanted to interfere in the U.S. Congressional elections marked what official U.S. officials told Reuters’ news agency that it was a new stage in an expanding campaign from Washington to apply China pressure.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertising to push trade, Beijing and Washington have a long-term trade war, with new customs duties on both countries.
Chinese and American experts say that revenge customs of China early in the business war were designed to harm exporters in counties such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trumps.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former head of Iowa for a long time, but that state is carrying out a lot of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had injured American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad said in his article in the Des Moines Register Sunday that “China is now increasing its persecution by publishing propaganda ads in our own free media,” he said.
“By spreading its propaganda, the government of China is taking advantage of the beloved freedom of speech traditions of the United States and our free media by publishing the cost of advertising in the newspaper Des Moines Register,” Branstad said in his article.
“On the other hand, few protesters can be found in magazine stalls on the streets of Beijing, and there can be no true reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese could have on China’s worrying economic policies, since the media are stuck under the heel of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the biggest newspapers in China got off the offer to publish — his article, but he did not state which magazine it was.
Experts warn that the Republicans are making female electors dismiss them for the mid-term discussions with the Kavanaugh language.
Experts have warned against negative reactions, especially from women, in the next mid-term discussions, because many Republicans have shorted and defended Brett Kavanaugh, appointed Supreme Court judge, who has been suing allegations of sexual harassment.
Very strong feelings have been around this issue and most of the Republicans have already shown publicly that they wanted to start voting.
“This thing cannot be backed up,” said Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at the Institute of Maxwell School at Syracuse, at The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that Jeff Flake, the senator of the Republican Republicans in Arizona, in the last minute on the investigation by the FBI, would be able to calm down the voters.
“Conners won’t forget what happened yesterday, they won’t forget about it tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, director and spokeswoman for the free group MoveOn, on Friday, according to Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters —November near — protested at the passage of the elders when the Republicans who controlled the ruling committee decided to continue with Kavanaughs’ nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
“The interest and enthusiasm of voters will go up from all the power,” said Stu Rothenberg, an independent politician, on the website.
“People will say that the interest was already great and that is true.
But he could be higher, especially among female voters in the countryside and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who dislike the president, but rarely vote --
The reporters predicted a setback if the Republicans insisted on having Kavanaugh confirmed, even for the testimony of Ford, as she declared her allegations of sexual harassment from him.
“This has become a major mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Still, a former member of the Republican Party National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is left to sit on the class, it’s also about how the Republicans have dealt with it and how they’ve dealt with it,” said Guy Cecil, president of the United States of America’s priorities, a group that helps to vote for Democrats, at the news centre.
However, Americans seem to disagree who should believe in testimony from both Ford and Kavanaugh, and a few majority support the latter.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believed or probably the testimony of Ford, while 35 percent said they believed or probably the testimony of Kavanaughs.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said that they’ve portrayed Kavanaugh probably or probably lied in their testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the call from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations that Ford made and from at least one other woman, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian news.
Ford testified before the Senate ruling committee last week and said Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 years old and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says Kavanaugh carried her genitals in front of her when they were both at a party studying at Yale University in the 9th century.
The man who invented the Internet has plans to start a new internet to fight against Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the Internet, is going to create a sporadic company to fight against Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The most recent project of technology fiction, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, the open platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have permission to access any information.
In a private interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee said in a joke that the intention behind the Inrupt was “the world government.”
“We have to do this now,” he said.
“This is a historic moment.
The program uses technology from Solid to enable people to create their own “personal data store online” — or POD.
There you can find a list of contacts, project list, calendar, music museum and other personal and work-related devices.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all present in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal data store is that it is completely under the user’s reach who can access any information.
The company calls it “personal violence by using data”
According to John Bruce, the CEO of the company, the idea that the company provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several programmers who were hired as developers to work in the project, and a group of developers in volunteer work.
As of this week, technology developers around the world could create their own independent applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team should not discuss “Facebook and Google whether to initiate a complete change that would put their current business model on their head in one night.
“We don’t ask for permission.
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published on Saturday at the Medium that Inrupt had it —to create energy in business and ecosystem that helps protect the honesty and quality of the new website based on Solid —
Berners-Lee revolutionized the network in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the discussion about the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even while he enters the Inrupt.
“I’m very optimistic about the next period of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Priest and holder of the Victorian Crucifixion from the First World War
The only English priest to be honored with the Victoria Cross in the first world war that a soldier has been hailed in his hometown 100 years later.
Sergeant Bernard Vann, who served as chief of the army, received the cross on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and he never learned that he had received the highest honorary British army.
His two sons revealed a memorial to him in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandfathers, Michael Vann, said that it was “very symbolic — that the memorial was revealed exactly 100 years from the glory of his grandfather.
According to London Gazette, Vann led his under-chief army on September 29, 1918, over the Canal de Saint-Quentin ditch — through a very thick fog and under a severe gun fire from cannons and machine guns —
Later, he ran to the line of fire and with “great courage,” leading the line forward before attacking one of his teams and defeating three soldiers.
He was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his great-grandfather was “something that I could never do, but something that makes you humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid the flower grain after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he would be “a great honour to participate in the parade, and added that “one true hero is shown with the support so many show.”
MMA fans woke up all night watching Bellator 206, instead of seeing Gurru pig
Just imagine, having woken up all night to see the crowded Bellator 206, just to be denied seeing the main event.
The program featured 13 San Jose games, including six of them on the main program, and they were broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5 channel.
At 6 o’clock in the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British viewers received unexpected arrivals when the broadcast changed to Gurru pig.
Some were unhappy after waking up all night to watch the battle.
One fan on Twitter declared the shares to be “any kind of sick joke.”
“In accordance with official rules, the content was not qualified audiences at six o’clock in the morning so they had to switch to children’s material,” said Dave Schwartz, Vice President of Marketing and Communication for Bellator, when asked out on the broadcast.
“Gurra Pigs, Yes”
Scott Coker, director of Bellator, said they would go over their time plans and take viewers in the UK with them in the account in the future.
“I think when I think about the review, we could probably solve this,” Coker said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on Sunday there and we can’t solve it until Sunday to our time, which is Monday with them.
But we are working on this.
Believe me, when the change was made, many text messages were sent back and forth, and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to fix this, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not so, it was a public problem.
I can promise this won’t happen next time.
We limited the night to five battles instead of six, as usual, but we tried too much and took care of ourselves.
This is an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “disadvantage” because of sexual orientation
Olympian Tom Daley claims to have experienced inadequacies towards other people in their upbringing because of their sexual orientation, but it has encouraged him to succeed.
The 24-year-old Daley said he didn’t realize that “he was different from someone else until he was in high school.”
In the radio show Desert Island Discs on the Radio 4 channel, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to provide others with “von”
He also said that the role of the parents reduced his interest in winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular director, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley was excluded in the first part of Laverne and said that he felt he was “a lesser man — but everyone else when he was a child because “it was not agreed in the community to like both boys and girls.”
He said, “All the way up to today, these feelings of feeling that I am inferior and different have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so that he would not cause any disappointment when he finally found out about his sexual orientation.
The double Olympic Bronze Sea has been widely worn as a supporter of LGBT and used its participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to summon more nations to legalize homosexuality.
He said he would listen because he felt fortunate to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to provide others with “hope.”
The World Champion triple said that it had “a surprise to him — to fall in love with a man — American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who he first met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year but said that the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you go through so much at a young age, he took part in his first Olympic Games 14 years and his father died of cancer three years later,” he said, “that it was difficult to find an elderly person who had experienced similar success and difficulties.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley, saying that “all his life-thinks had been crushed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold prize,” he said.
“You know what, there are more important things than a gold prize at the Olympic Games.
Robbie is my Olympic gold award.
His son is baptized in the head of Robert, his father who died in 2011, 30 years old, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about was whether they had received their tickets for London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the lead.
“I couldn’t tell him that he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until his breath stopped and he was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible,” he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that I had dreamed of this all my life, to dip in front of the audience at home at the Olympic Games. It doesn’t feel better,” he said.
It was also inspiration to the choice of the first song - Proud after Heather Small - which had inspired him for the Olympics and still gave him a goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 p.m. to British local time.
Mickelson in bad form and dead sitting on the class in Ryder cup on Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson will score on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in Ryder the cup, but he needs to find his old rhythm again so that the value is not surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who plays in the competition for the 12th time, was left to sit in the class after the decision of his predecessor Jim Furyk for the four-ball games and four-day games.
Instead of being the center of the Hasar, as he has been so often before for the United States, the day of the five-time master is divided between being a cheerleader and practicing the playing grades of the field in the hope of correcting what it is that it amar.
Mickelson, 48 years old, was never the one who shot with the killer, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National Golf Course, where he wants a glamorous punishment often for bad shots.
And not enough that the golf course is a major challenge in itself, but that Mickelson must compete against Frances Molinari, winner of the British Open, in the ninth game on Sunday. Molinari has the new Tommy Fleetwood team and together they have won all four games this week.
If Americans, who are four points below as they take the first game of 12 solo games, reach a good start, the game Mickelson could split up.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he could hardly say anything else.
“He fully understood the role he had today, patted me on his back and took care of me and said he’d be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He’s in the famous palace and he’s been so much a substitute for the past and this week.
I probably didn’t expect him to play two games.
I saw more, but that’s how we ended up and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo in the number of games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could market the end of the process in the Ryder cup that has never achieved quite as much as other achievements on his record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and 7 rounds, but Furyk said that his presence had a certain vague effect on the team.
\"He's funny, he's the iron, hen, he likes to make fun of people and it's great to have him in the team room,\" he explained.
“I think the younger players enjoyed fighting him too this week, and it was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just the golf game.
Thomas Bjorn, the leader of Europe knows that a great deal of advance can go away quickly.
European leader Thomas Bjorn knows from the experience that a good advance for the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily change into uncomfortable experience.
Dann played first in the game in Valderrama in 1997, where, alongside the leadership of the team Seve Ballesteros, five points ahead of the U.S., he managed to claim victory at the end with the minimum possible ladder difference, with 141⁄2-131⁄2 wins.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a lot of advance in Valderrama, we had a lot of advance in Brookline where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, but only right then,” said Bjorn, who was seen here in the picture, after watching the 2018 season win 5-3 both Friday and Saturday and reaching the 10-6 lead at Le Golf National level.
The story will show me and everyone in the team that it’s not over.
We'll all be ready tomorrow.
Let's go and do everything right.
It hasn’t been completed until all the levels are on the table.
We have our goal and it’s trying to win this cup, we focus on it
I have always said this, I focus on the players 12 of our team, but we are very aware of our opponents in the other team - the best golfer in the world -
Bjorn was very pleased with how his players would have been at a difficult stage and added: “I never go ahead with myself in this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow it’s the performance of the people who matter, and that’s another thing.
It’s great to play with partners when everything goes well, but when you play one is tried on all people’s skills as a golfer.
It’s the message you need to send the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and he also has to play his best game himself.
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, will strive for his players to stand better in individual games than with partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both sides of this big shift on the last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brookline but ended up losing when Europe carried out the \"powering work in Medinah\"
\"I remember every fucking word,\" he answered asking how Ben Crenshaw, late in 1999, had continued to encourage his players for the last day.
“We need to play 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start quickly as happened in Brookline and Medinah.
When it comes to building up, it causes a lot of pressure on the game that is in the middle.
We ranked our players according to it and let them play as we feel that will go best tomorrow...
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defense and play against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the second European players in the first half of the games.
“I chose these players in this series because I think they cover all the way through,” Bjorn said about his choice to players in the individual competition.
Germany's new warship was delayed again.
The most recent military ship of the German Navy should have been built in 2014 to replace old warships from the Cold War period, but it will not be ready until the first year of next year due to faulty systems and increasing costs, according to news in the area.
The building of the “Rheinland-Pfalz,” the leader of the new warships of Baden-Wuerttemberg, has now been delayed until the first half of the year 2019, according to the sources of the army spokesman who spoke to the Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship was supposed to be in the service of the Navy in 2014, but serious problems after the delivery of the project.
The ships four of the Baden-Wuerttemberg group ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to replace the warships of Bremen, which have arrived until their years.
They should be equipped with a powerful parachute, many anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft rockets and hide technology such as reduced radar infrared, and sound signals.
Other important features are longer use times - it should be possible to use the latest ships for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, constant delays mean that this warship of the latest type - which is said to allow Germany to show its strength on the sea - must be immediately out of date when they are finally taken advantage of, says Die Zeit.
The F125 warship came into the news last year when the German army officially refused to accept the fleet and returned it to the Blohm & Voss drop in Hamburg.
This was the first time the mariner has returned the ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the divorce, but the German media spoke of a number of women who were seriously “galled in the software and hardware — who made the warship useless if sent to the campaign.
The faults of the software were especially important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships are controlled by 120 crews, which are half smaller than those of Bremen.
It was also found that the ship was too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to repair it in the future.
The 7000 tons of ship “Rheinland-Pfalz” is thought to be twice as heavy as ships in a similar category used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to hardware defects, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is beginning to cause problems.
It is said that he had reached EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion), but was initially to be EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems affecting the most recent ships are particularly important in view of the warning that the advantages of the Germans on the sea are decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the Defense Committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the Navy was actually becoming a “in-house body of capable ships.”
The officer said that the problem had come about over time, because older ships were removed from use, but no ships came in their place.
He lamented that none of the orders of the Baden-Wuerttemberg group could be used by the Navy.
The National Trust Conservation Association spyes on the secret life of leather
A new study that takes place on the land in the Scottish highlands aims to find out how bats use the landscape when hunting for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland Conservation Association, will monitor different types of leather trays in the Inverewe gardens of Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed in key areas of the area to monitor the behavior of the leather blades over the period.
NHS staff and volunteers will also go on surveillance tours with handheld sensors.
Experts will record all the recordings to find out the frequency of the calls, which the leather trays give up, and what types do what.
A map of the habitat and report will then be published to create a detailed picture of their behaviour on a geographical scale.
Rob Dewar, a night care counselor for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal what types of habitats are most important to the mammoths and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of managing habitats, e.g. by creating no and how best to maintain forestlands for bats and other related species.
In the last century in Scotland and throughout the UK, the number of bats has decreased significantly.
They are at risk from construction and development projects that affect their nests and reduce their habitats.
Windmills and light can also cause risk, also fly paper and certain chemical treatments on construction materials, as well as attacks from household meats.
However, bats are not really blind.
However, the ears bring them much better benefit than the eyes when it comes to hunting soon, because they are used to hunting at night.
They used advanced metal-based technology to find insects and things that are on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for maintaining over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, take leather trays very seriously.
At the organizations, ten experts, who perform regular checks, courtesque investigations, and sometimes rescue operations, operate.
The association has even set up the first and only batting ground of Scotland at the Three River Gardens in Dumfries and Galloway where eight of the ten bats of Scotland have a home.
David Thompson, the mayor of the farm, said he was a perfect place for them.
“Treave’s area is great for leather spasms,” he said.
“We have old buildings, plenty of trees and lots of good habitats.
But there’s still a lot of ignorance about leather trays, so the work we work here and in other places will help us better understand what they need to do in order to clean up,
He stressed the importance of checking with leather trays before maintenance takes place in residential areas, where possible accidental destruction of one nest can kill up to 400 female leather trays and young and destroy all leather trays in the area.
Leather patches are protected and it is forbidden to kill them, harass or interfere, or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we don’t know how well the number of their species goes,
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape when lawyers prepare for prosecution against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called charges against him about rape “falfare news,” saying that people want to “be aware of themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers intend to prosecute the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
The front for Portugal and Juventus have been charged with raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is said to have paid her $375,000 for the incident, according to Der Spiegel’s report on Friday.
A few hours after the charges were published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, in Instagram Live, told 142 million of his followers that they were “fals news.”
No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today is fake news, the world champion said five times to the camera.
“These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but it is part of the job.
I am a happy man, and everything is fine, and the player smiled.
Attorney Ronaldos prepares to prosecute Der Spiegel for the allegations they have called “an unacceptable disclosure of suspicion of private life,” according to Reuter’s news agency.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that Ronaldo would require compensation for “an injury of the same amount as the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”
The intended incident was said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms hotel and casino in Las Vegas.
After attending a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in the rectory, according to documents submitted for the Clark County District in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told her that he was “99 percent good man — who had fallen into temptation because of the “1 percent”
The documents argue that Ronaldo has agreed that the couple had sex but that they had both consented.
Mayorga argues that she went to the police and had her injuries taken to hospital, but finally accepted a settlement outside the courtroom because she was “deeply afraid of revenge — and was worried about becoming “decreased publicly,”
She says she wants to stop the settlements because she is still in a shock after an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to going to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape was due to take place, and this summer he went to the Italian giant Juve with a 100 million euro deal.
Brexit: Britain would “see to it forever — to lose car manufacturers
Britain would “see it forever — if it lost its position as an international leader among car manufacturers by Brexit,” says Greg Clark, Minister of Business.
He added that it was “an issue — that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a contract, the company would temporarily stop manufacturing in its Burnaston factory, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays at the border if Brexit without a contract would be that reality would cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis automobiles, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European countries.
“My opinion is that if the UK crashes out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production stations in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Director-General of Toyota, Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concern about EU exit without consent on how international trade should take place, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that what car manufacturers claim to be the target chain risk if Brexit without a contract becomes a reality.
Toyota’s production line is based on the reception at the last hour, where parts are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and the EU for cars manufactured after order.
If the UK reduces the EU without a contract on 29 March, it may interfere with the border which the industry considers may lead to a delay and a lack of components.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day store in its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and therefore production would stop.
Mr Clark said that the Chequers program Theresu May for future relations with the EU’s, specifically aimed at preventing these views at the border —
“We need to have a contract. We want to get the best deal that allows us to enjoy not only success in the modern world, but as an opportunity that we can benefit,” he said on radio show on BBC Radio 4.
“The evidence, not just from Toyota, but from other manufacturers as well, shows that we must be able to continue with a very effective approach.
Toyota could not say how long their production would stop, but warned that for a longer period of time, increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a professional worker in the factory, said that his employees are increasingly concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs go away they never come back.
The government spokesman said: “We have presented a detailed and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again, according to the White House.
The White House declared on Sunday that an important meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein, an assistant state prosecutor, could be “returned for a week — now the dispute is over Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court’s committee, continues.
Rosenstein manages the work of Robert Muellers, special prosecutor, who investigates Russian intervention in elections, links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and possible obstacles to the progress of justice by the President.
For many weeks, stories have been going to Washington about whether Trump will run an assistant state prosecutor and thus put Mueller's independence at risk.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had been talking about having a recording device to address Trump and the possibility of turning the president away from the session using the 25th additional article of the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied these statements.
On Monday, however, he visited the White House, including news that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, but he was at the United Nations in New York City.
Trump said that he would rather not run Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed so that he was not at the same time as the hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who has accused him of sexual harassment, bore both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed the vote of the Senate.
Sarah Sander, Trump's media representative, was on broadcast on Fox News Sunday.
When asked out at the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It has not been decided on a date for him, it could be this week. I think it is possible that he will be delayed by the second week because of everything else that is going on at the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and it’s always my pleasure to inform the media.
Some reporters disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press meeting since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not because of dissatisfaction over the fact that TV reporters had “wisdom,” but she said, “I don’t disagree with the fact that they have a virtuality.
She then gave evidence that direct communication between Trump and the media would increase.
\"The president answers more questions to the media than any other president has done before,\" she said, without referring to the sources: \"We've reviewed these numbers --
Press meetings will still take place, Sanders said, but “if the media has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it’s much better than talking to me.
We try to do a lot of it and you've seen us do a lot of that last week and it will replace a media meeting when you can talk to the President of the United States...
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or media meetings with other leaders who visit him.
Media meetings with him are rare.
The president may have shown that reason in New York this week, when he showed himself ruthless and at times strange behavior in front of a group of reporters.
The Minister for Health writes EU health care staff in Scotland because of the interest in Brexit
The Minister for Health has written staff from the EU working in the health system in Scotland (NHS Scotland) to declare the gratitude of the nation and wish that it continues to work after Brexit has passed.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months until the United Kingdom leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already promised to meet the cost of the work permit application for EU employees working within the public service sector.
Mrs. Freeman wrote in his letter: “In the summer, talks between the UK and the EU have continued because of the statements and are expected to be made this autumn.
The British government has also worked to prepare if it is not possible to do so.
I know it must be a lot of uncertainty for all of you.
That’s why I want to say again how much I appreciate the work of the entire staff, no matter every national.
EU co-workers and many of them come with valuable experience and knowledge that strengthens and improves the work of health care and benefits for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home, and we really want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after having had a headache
Christion Abercrombie, a director of Tennessee State Tigers, had to undergo emergency surgery after having suffered a head injury of 31-27 casualties against the team Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to news from Mike Organ, Tennessee magazine.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State's chief coach, told reporters that the injury had been a little too short for halftime.
“He came to the sideline and fell down there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel provided Abercrombie with oxygen on the sideline before being placed on the barrier and carried out for further inspection.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris, a WSMV radio broadcaster in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was in surgery at the Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there was “no information on the type or severity of the impact yet — and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, who is in the final year of school, plays his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five caps on Saturday before he left, which raised the total number of the caps in him to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher fuel charges when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher fuel charges when buying property in the UK. The surplus will be used to help homeless people, according to the new plan of the Conservative Party
The operation will make no success of Corby's campaign to attract young voters
Increased charges will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The government plans to make 120 million pounds a year - to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be charged for higher fuel charges when buying property in the UK. The cash will be used to help homeless people. Theresa May will announce this today.
The operation will be considered an attempt to make no success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by praising housing at affordable prices and taxing high-income people rather.
Individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK need to pay higher fuel charges, and the excess will go into government actions to help homeless people.
The increase - which is additional to current fuel charges, including the increase that was put on two years ago in an extra home and real estate purchase for rent - could be up to three percent.
The government estimates that the increase will make up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new constructions in London are bought by foreign parties, which causes price increases and makes those who want to buy property for the first time harder to get into the market.
Many of the surrounding areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “dream towns” because of the number of foreign traders who spend most of their time abroad.
The new direction comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in fuel charges to help more young people get their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by buying land but not using them, and urged May to cancel quotas in homes at affordable prices to fix “house houses” - United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of substantial improvements in housing matters, including rental controls and the end of rental-free rentals.
He also wants to give more power to build a new home.
Theresa May said: “I said last year that I would devote myself to the restoration of the British dream in my first season - that every new generation should enjoy a better quality of life.
This means that we are changing our real estate market.
The doors of Britain will always open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it may not be true that it is as easy for foreign parties as a company with headquarters abroad to buy a home and for a skilled British farmer.
For many, the dream of their own housing has become far too distant, and the shame that comes with homelessness is still too real,
Jack Ross: “My main goal is to train Scotland.
Jack Ross, coach of Sunderland, says that it is his “first goal — to become a coach of Scotland at some point.
This 42-year-old shooter now enjoys the challenge of blowing new lives in the North-East Club which is now in third place in the first division, three levels from the top.
He moved to Sunderland in the summer after returning to the Scottish Premier League in the last season.
“I wanted to play for my people as a player.
I was injured in the knee, and that was the end of it,\" Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound interview.
“But I grew up watching Scotland often in Hampden with my father, as a child, and there’s always something that has pulled me back.
But that would only be possible if I was able to train the team.
Former Ross as coaches Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of the Alloa Athletic Club said he did not feel any fear of following in the footsteps of such famous names of such a large club, but he had previously refused coaching places at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“As I am, I will measure my success by thinking, ‘Can I bring this club back to the top-level team?
This club has a two-time home in the selection department for its structure and facilities,\" he said.
“It’s not an easy job to get him there, but I’d probably only look at me as a success here if I get the club back up there...
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of the training for Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to recover from falling into the third division, and changed St Mirren, who was about to fall over the division, in the league champion next season.
Ross says he was more confident than ever in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
\"It was probably a real time,\" he said about the time when he became a coach of Alloa.
“I really believed that the coaching work was suitable for me, even more than playing.
It sounds weird, because I was doing well, I had a decent profit from it and a good deal of good luck.
But changes can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot every week.
I still go through it with regard to stress and pressure from the job, but the coaching work seems just right for me.
I always wanted to train and now I do, I’ve never felt better with myself in all my adult years.

The best time for beer is at 5:30 pm on Saturdays, according to a survey
This summer’s heat wave has been found to be beneficial for the British bar that is in the pool, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The sales of pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent in July, while the sale of restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, from the business consulting firm CGA, who compiled the figures, said: “The continued sunshine and unexpected success of England in the world cup meant that July followed similar patterns and June months, when the barsales increased by 2.8 percent, except what restaurants sold even less.
Salan fell by 1.8 percent in the restaurant in June and got worse again in July.
Pubs and bars, primarily aimed at drinking, were the best ones with a more upturn while restaurants went downhill.
Pubs that sold food also had a hard time in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to drink.
Sales of drinks in the pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent per month, but the grocery store decreased by 3 percent,
Paul Newman, from the RSM analysis company, said: “These results continue on the swing we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the effects of important social events or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to selling in markets outside of the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups still have difficulties, although the sales decrease of 4.8 percent between months is particularly painful above the continued pressure due to costs.
This long and hot summer could hardly come at a worse time for food outlets and only time will reveal whether the temperate temperature, as we have had in August, will improve the situation...
Total growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including in newly opened locations, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting how slow the openings are.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the surveillance company with the sale in the British pub bar and restaurant gardens, collects and records data from 47 business groups, with a combined roll-up of £9 billion and is the industrial focus of the gear.
One in every five children has a secret account on social media that they hide from their parents
One in every five children, down to the age of 11, has secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents and teachers, according to survey results.
A survey report covering 20,000 students showed an increase in “Insta” sites
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual material
Twenty percent of students say they have an account they show parents
One in every five children, down to the age of 11, creates secret accounts on social media that they keep secret to adults.
A survey report that included 20,000 students showed a significant increase in Insta’s accounts, which are referenced on Instagram’s website.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual material.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean “cial” account to show their parents, as well as to have secret accounts.
A mother who fell down on her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found a teenager who encouraged others to “trouble me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the private university director (HMC), showed that 40 percent of children aged 11-18 had two accounts and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, the chairman of HMC, said: “It’s a concern that so many young people are trying to create an area online where parents and teachers cannot find them...
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voiced athletes” of the Scottish Athletics Sports Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as head of the Board of Directors without executive power at the Annual General Meeting of the Board.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful athlete and Ian Beattie, the chairman of the committee said that the nomination was a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her extensive experience in the last decade.
\"Eilidh enjoys great respect within sports communities in Scotland, the UK and international, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would make a lot of money to get it in the committee,\" Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am very interested in speaking on behalf of athletes and hope that I can put my weight on and help lead the sport forward in Scotland.
The American, who won among the ananrs 200 metres and the 400 metre run of the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, but a total of four Olympic gold, and now a regular visitor of the BBC, was paralyzed after receiving a transient stroke of blood.
He wrote on Twitter: “For a month I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would tell me if I liked it and how much.
It’s been a hard job, but I’ve really liked it, learned to walk and do sports today!
Thank you for your encouragement.
Breast pump absorpment, which bears mothers together with cows, causes an online dispute
A company that manufactures breast pump is now reviewed online due to advertising that carries milking mothers with milked cows.
The company Elvie published a detailed advertisement to mark the introduction of what is said to be “the first silent breast pump in the world that can be worn outside — the advertisement is inspired by music videos and should show the freedom that the new pump provides to mothers who are with children in their breasts.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and come with a song like this: “Yes, I’m milking, but you don’t see a tail on me,” and “If you didn’t notice it, it’s not a jug but a breast on me.”
The product continues: “Pump, pump, I feed the kids, pump, pump, I pump milk from the julls.”
However, the advertisement, which appears on the Facebook website of the company, has led to an online review.
The video has 77,000 views and hundreds of reviews and has received a variety of responses from viewers, many of whom say that it ran with “the horror” that follows the milk industry.
“It’s a bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just as we do, they need to become calfish and bear to produce milk, unless the calves are removed from them just a few days after they are born,” said in one of the reviews.

Another viewer wrote: “Very difficult for both mother and child.
Why not use them to advertise breast pump for mothers who get to keep their children?
Another added: “This advertisement is totally out of date with time.
Others came the ad in defense, and one woman admitted that the song was “the first thing.”
“I think this is a great idea.
I would have bought this if I still had a baby.
I felt like a cow when I was pumping milk.
The advertising is a bit crazy, but I took it as it is.
It’s a genius, one of the viewers wrote.
Another said: “This is a fun advertisement that is directed to mothers who pump milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like ‘kum’.
This is not an advertisement that compliments or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the advertisement, the women's group shows that they were all dancing with the breast pumps hidden in their breasts.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women say they feel like cows when pumping milk.
The Elvie pump, however, is quite silent, has no wires or wires and fits comfortably into the breast holder, which gives women the freedom to move, hold on to their child and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, a co-owner and head of Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that she deserved a prominent presentation that would evoke a review.
By comparing women to cows, we wanted to direct the cast light to breast pumping and all its challenges, and even show in a fun and familiar way how much freedom the new pump would provide.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has reached the news.
At the fashion week in London, two children's mother appeared on a fashion show for the designer Morta Yakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrants quietly moved to camps near Texas border
The number of immigrant children in detention has suddenly increased even though the number of those crossing the border monthly has remained somewhat the same. Part of the reason is that hard speech and policies presented by Trump’s government have made it harder to bring children into temporary fetuses.
In general, the foster parents have been unregistered immigrants themselves, and have been afraid to put their potential to remain in danger in the country, by offering to foster a child.
The risk increased in June, when public authorities announced that potential foster parents and other adults within the home would be required to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with the immigration control.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the head of the immigration and customs authorities, witnessed before the Senate and said that his institution had arrested a number of people who applied to foster single children.
The company later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not on the file.
“Nearly 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or in homes that foster children are illegal in the country, and much of them are illegal immigrants on a criminal record.
“We keep looking for people,” said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to work faster on children's issues, representatives announced new rules requiring some of the children to appear in the courtroom within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days of the first set-up, according to a staff working in the lawsuits.
Many of them will meet through a video meeting, rather than in their own person, to argue for their legal position before a judge in immigration matters.
The children who are sentenced to an admission to the country are sent out of the country.
The longer that children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent or refugee trials, according to the staff of the camps and reports that the system has published in the past month.
Speakers said that these problems are even more likely in a larger organization as in Tornillo, where no one is likely to notice that although a child is having difficulty, because of how many they are.
They added that the transfer of children to the camp town without giving enough time to prepare them spiritually or say goodbye to friends could increase the shocks that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria says “The U.S., France, and Turkey to withdraw immediately.”
Walid al-Mualem, Foreign Minister, also said in his speech to the General Assembly of the United States that Syrian refugees should return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays the role of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign troops were illegal in Syria, under the false assumption that they fought terrorism, and that “they will be treated accordingly,”
“They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions,” he said.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terrorism was almost over — in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “to wage this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories — of both terrorist groups and “all illegal foreign parties”
The United States has around 2,000 Syrian soldiers, most of whom train and advise both Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs who fight against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in this war-rich country.
As for refugees, Moualem said that circumstances would be good enough for them to return, and he taught “some Western countries —to “extreme out a reasonless fear —which encouraged refugees to stay away.
“We have called for an international community and a humanitarian organization to facilitate their return,” he said.
“They create politics from something that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funds for reconstruction in Syria unless a political agreement exists between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
According to the U.S., a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a neutral area for the last major campaign of the opposition has created an opportunity to continue political dialogue.
The treaty between Russia and Turkey prevented a massive attack by Syrian troops by Russia, in the province of three million people.
Moualem, on the other hand, stressed that the agreement had “exactly closed” and expressed hope that military action would focus on jihads, including fighters from the Nusra Front, who have links with Al-Qaeda, and that they “was eliminated.”
Staffan de Mistura, Ambassador of the United States, hopes to be able to come to the first meetings with a new committee composed of the members of the government and the opposition, to negotiate a constitution for Syria after the war and pay the street for elections.
Moualem set out conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, and said that her work should be limited to “going over the provisions of the present government, and warned against all interventions.
Reasons that Trump will win another election term
According to that argument, Mr. Trump would win the re-elections in 2020, unless charges and scandals end his presidential career, as many free-thinking audiences are likely to hope for.
In what would ever be the \"dramatic end of the presidency,\"
As you can see, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the outlook at best time has more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN, and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best time, which is an increase from 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC, “The Rachel Maddow Show, has peaked views with up to 3.5 million viewers on important news nights.
“This is a fire that people are attracted to, because this is something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the director of the ABC drama series “Designed Survivor” about a government official who will become president after the House of Parliament is destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comicist and writer of the book: Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys - Club, has a different idea.
She remembers a taxi in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’ said Miss Scovell to me.
There is entertainment in the chaos.
However, unlike what is shown on television, the stories from Washington could determine the fate of Roe v Wade, whether the families of immigrants can unite and the health of the international community.
Only those who enjoy what the greatest privilege can afford to stop watching.
And yet, this is more than being an enlightened citizen when you look at the sixth time at a group of experts arguing the use of Bob Woodwards on “Afar close-up” sources for your book “Fear,” or $15,000 jackets from ostrichs dressed by Paul Manafort (“flike born with pride,” said the Washington Post) and the consequences of the exact biological description of Stormy Daniels on Mr. Trump.
I will never see Super Mario again.
“One of the things that he does without letting a man feel like a real-life show is that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of the films “Pawn Stars,” he discussed the employee’s role in Trump’s show and daily changes in the history thread (e.g., starting fighting with N.F.L. and complimenting Kim Jong-Un).
You can’t miss a show, otherwise you lose the thread.
When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss, there was 26 degrees of heat and sunshine outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he stayed inside and looked at MSNB while taking up CNN.
He could not break away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were creating all these crazy things in the old days and people said, “This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” said Mr. Fleiss.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out people were right.

Money outside of the flood in the nearest mid-term elections
It is not surprising that the 17th voting area of Pennsylvania sees the money flow to it, thanks to the reorganization of the electoral areas that led to two representatives competing for the same seat.
The newly established Pittsburgh area sends out the Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another electoral area in the special elections last summer.
Lamb offers himself to other representatives, the Republican, Keith Rothfus, who is now the representative of the old 12th electors in Pennsylvania, who struggles greatly with the new 17th election area.
The map of the electoral territory was reorganized after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old electoral areas were organized in the interests of the Republicans and that it violates the Constitution.
The race for the new 17th election has been the beginning of a competition in the financing campaign between the main funding partners of both parties, the Democratic Election Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a short victory in March before the 18th election in Pennsylvania, but many followed that election.
The Republicans had previously held that seat for more than a decade and Donald Trump, the president won the election by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a little advantage.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador because of support for China, but then ceased.
The government noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the co-owners ran the Trump management team away.
The Foreign Ministry officials decided to call back the U.S. ambassadors in El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama for “new decisions not to recognize the Teven anymore,” said Heather Nauert, the minister’s spokeswoman in a statement early this month.
However, penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million from the United States for relief work in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The penalties, which were imposed and included, among other things, the reduction of financial support and restrictions on the publication of residence permits, would have been painful for the Central America, where a high unemployment rate and the death rate are high.
As the internal meetings continued, U.S. and Central American representatives delayed a conference on security and economic success and were to follow a similar meeting held last year and assumed to be a step forward in action to prevent people from moving to the United States.
However, in the middle of September, representatives from the top ranks made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus ending all the misconceptions of punishment against El Salvador.
Mike Pence, Vice President, should now address the conference, which will take place in mid-October, as a symbol of its importance in the eyes of the government, said the memoirs.
The three U.S. ambassadors also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new hard message or punishment from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr Bolton refused to discuss further the discussions described by the three US representatives, including two ministers, who agreed to discuss the house talks against being anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outsider who works closely with the government and also spoke of the matter against anonymity.
Learn the story
The next scandal could be the report by Roberts Mueller, a special prosecutor, on the possible actions of Mr Trump to prevent justice, but for that charge there is numerous official evidence.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller reverses his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign has worked with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If the Congress is to be governed by another party, Trump may have to be responsible for it, in the mouth he prepares to meet his electors again, and perhaps he will be ordered by his peers.
It’s not clear, however, and I don’t want Trump’s fall to be unmistakable, nor his colleague in Europe.
We all need to choose, both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, which will affect how long the battle will be.
In 1938, German officials were ready to rob Hitler, only if western countries had given him resistance and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the year of disaster that followed.
The story revolves around such important points and faster or delays the unstoppable progress of democracy.
The Americans are facing some such important points now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump is running Rod Rosenstein's prosecutor, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this magazine reported that last year he had proposed to make secret recordings of the president and discussed whether he was ill-qualified in office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the news from the Times is not correct.
“How will we respond if the recent investigation by the FBI on Brett Kavanaugh is not detailed or fair, or if he is confirmed in the seat of a Supreme Court judge despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote for Congress during the mid-term that will leave Mr. Trump axla responsibility?
If we fall on these tests, democracy will have to endure a long winter.
But I don’t think we’re going to fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia and was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government and was previously in my embassy.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with the hook.
With such a legacy, how can I other than look positive to our future?

Graham Dorrans, Rangers' team, optimistic for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory against the Austrians will bring them in a strong position to get out of the G-group of the European Union. Rangers made an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month.
The injury to the knee prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing his first game during the season until in the game against Villa area that ended with a 2-2 draw, but he believes that Rangers can take advantage of the results as a jumpboard for better performance.
“It was good to get this point for us, because Villarreal is a strong team,” said Dorrans, 31.
“We started the game in the belief that we could achieve something and ended up taking one point.
Perhaps we could have won at the end, but in the overall view, the odds were likely a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came strong into the second half and played better.
Thursday is another important evening for the European Union.
Hopefully we can reach three levels, but it will be a difficult game because they went well in their last game. But with the audiences who support us, I’m sure we’ll take it and get a positive result.
The last year was difficult, both because of the injury and the changes that happened in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling in the area.
The team is good and the boys enjoy it, the training is good.
I hope we can move forward now, put the last season behind us and succeed.
Women lose their sleep because of fear of losing their retirement savings
Although participants in the poll had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talk to their family members about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide survey said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children.
“People want family members to change it, but it doesn’t take the right steps to have those conversations,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Insurance Department.
That's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t make your wishes bright with good notice.
Talk to your counselor and your family about where and when you get care, because these options can change a lot in terms of cost.
Get your financial adviser in the matter: Your counselor can also help you find a way to pay for this cost.
Among the choices you have to pay for long-term care are traditional life insurance with long-term care, mixed life insurance that pays out in cash, to help pay the cost, or self-confidence with your own money - as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: Prevent legal conflicts in advance.
Get your health care provider so you can name someone you trust to manage your health care and ensure that your health care professional goes to your request if you can’t tell them directly yourself.
Also consider getting a procurator for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your accounts are paid if you can’t do it yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your older father or mother is in an emergency and is in a hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Give that information exactly in a written plan so that you are ready.
“It’s not just about money, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin said.
“What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Be ready for that plan.

The man was not injured, and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Floods in Indonesia
At least 384 died after a powerful earthquake and flood in the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, representatives said, and it is expected that the number of the dead will rise.
Since all communication is down, relief workers have not been able to provide any information from Donggala County, which is located near the centre of the earthquake, which was 7.5 in Richter.
More than 16,000 people were left their homes in Pala after the accident.
Here are a few key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province and is located for the bottom of a narrow river on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The estimated number of inhabitants was 379.800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th birthday when the earthquake and flood broke out.
Donggala is a county that covers over 380 km of the beach line in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is a control area under the province, had an estimated population of up to 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main industries of the Central Sulawesi region, especially in the Dongala beach area.
Nickel mines are also important in the region, but most of them are in Morowali, which is on the beach in the face of Sulawesi.
Flood waves have crashed on Palu and Donggala several times in the past century, according to the Indonesia disaster.
In 1938, over 200 people died when a flood wave and hundreds of houses in Donggala were destroyed.
There will also be a flood in the western part of Donggala in 1996, where nine died.
Indonesia sits on the other active cycle of the Pacific Sea, where earthquakes are common.
Here are the major earthquakes and floods of the past year:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Aceh region of northern Sumataru rode over December 26 and set off a flood that will take place in 14 countries and killed 226 thousand people across the Indian Ocean shoreline, of which more than half were in Aceh.
2005: There was a strong earthquake on the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people are killed on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Earthquake up to 6.8 on Richter rode across southern Jöva, the largest island of Indonesia, causing a flood to the south coast and killing almost 700 people.
2009: Earthquake up to 7.6 on Richter rode over near the city of Padang, which is the capital of the western part of Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: Earthquake up to 7.5 on Richter rode over one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, and raised up to 10 metres high flood waves that destroyed numerous villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A ground earthquake raged over the Pidie Jaya County in Aceh and caused destruction and flooding as people remembered the destruction of the deadly earthquakes and floods in 2004.
No floods were formed this time, but over 100 were killed when construction collapsed.
2018: Major earthquakes are riding over the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, and over 500 people are killed, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stuck on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic assault charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and president of the United States, has been arrested for allegations of physical assault.
Palin, 29 years old and from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested due to suspected domestic violence, for attempting to prevent the notification of domestic violence and being harassed against arrest, according to a report by the Alaska State Police, published on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin took the phone off her friend when she tried to call the police to report intentional offences.
Palin is held at the Mat-Su station where he waits for the hearings before the court, and is held against $500 insurance, according to KTUU news.
He was convicted on Saturday when he declared that he was “not guilty, blasphemous — when he was asked to declare guilt or innocence, according to the news centre.
Palin is charged with three offences in category A, which means he could be sentenced to jail for up to one year and had to pay $250,000 fines.
He has also been charged with offences in category B, which is punished with one day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin called the police to report the intention of the attack.
The case is now being dealt with for the surrender of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, for preventing the notification of domestic violence, and for carrying weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claims to have punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of rebels in 2016 after she taught a devastating disorder about her son's violent behavior, after his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Floods in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake, 7.5 in Richter, caused a flood and has destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication systems are down and the number of the dead is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake was right in the centre of Sulawesi Island, located northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos that show when the incident took place on social media.

Prosecutors are seeking a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attacker in New York City
New York prosecutors want death penalty over Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected to have participated in a terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people. This is a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for violations of federal law since 1953.
Saipov, age 30, is thought to have taken Home Depot car hire to attack people on a bike along the street West Side Highway in the lower part of Manhattan. He drove down there walking and cycling road passengers in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the victim eight “willingly” and cause serious bodily injuries, according to the willful statement of the death penalty recorded in the New York Southern District.
Both of these charges can lead to a possible death penalty, according to the court case.
Many weeks after the attack, Saipov accused the federal court of 22 teams, including eight charges of murder for criminal purposes, which are usually used by prosecutors in charges against organized criminal organizations. Also, Saipov was charged with the crime of violence and for destroying the vehicle.
The attack involved “significantly preconceived planning, said prosecutors and declared Sapiov’s actions to be “horrible, cruel, and immoral.”
\"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov was elected as a body injury, injury and loss for families and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci,\" said the Willing Statement.
Five victims were travelers from Argentina.
It has been a decade since New York City's last death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in New York City in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were killed after being convicted of conducting spyes for the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years before.
The couple were both put to death in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no evidence of the repentance of the days and months after the attack, according to court records.
He told investigators that he was doing well with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he had the idea of the attack after watching videos from ISIS on his phone, according to the prosecutor.
He also asked him to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has declared his innocence on all 22 sides of the charge.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s official defenders, said they were “consciously disappointed by the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to ask for a death penalty rather than accepting a life imprisonment declaration without the possibility of a life imprisonment will only extend the impact of this incident to all parties,” Patton said.
The defenders of Saipov's had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek the death penalty.
The Board of Governors said that NIGEL FARAGE should lead negotiations for Brexit.
Nigel Farage promised to “act the army of the people,” today in protest at the convention of the conservatives.
This former head of the Ukip said that politicians must “feel for pressure — from doubters about the EU, at the same time as one of Theresa May’s Senators suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Captain Peter Bone said to the Birmingham protests that the United Kingdom “are going out — now if Mr. Farage was the leader of Brexit.
However, the challenge that May faces in accepting a deep dispute between her own team members was even more evident when the conservatives, who want to remain in the EU, took part in other protests against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has difficulty keeping Chequers' plan on the right track and is under criticism from those who are affiliated with Brexit, those who are opposed, and the EU.
The Allies claimed that she will continue to fight to reach agreement with Brussels despite opposition - and force those who are opposed to Brexit and the Workers' Party to choose between her plans and “uneasy”
Mr. Bone said to the Leave Means Leave protesting in Solihull that he wanted to “lost on the Chequers plan”
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been given the responsibility and responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in control, we’d be out now,” he said.
The Senator from Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to get rid of the Chequers plan.
He explained his opposition to the EU and said: “We did not fight in world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own law in our own country.
Mr. Bone pointed out that the public’s opinion had changed from the 2016 elections: “The idea that the British public has changed their minds and wants to stay is completely untrue.
Andrea Jenkyn, Brexit’s staunch supporter, also said to reporters: “I simply want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers program is unpopular among the public and the opposition will not vote with it. She enjoys the opposition among our parties and activists who are on the streets and vote for us.
Do it, stop the Chequers plan and start listening.
In a letter to May, she added: “The prime ministers keep the job when they keep their promises.”
Mr. Farage said that the politicians would have to “feel for pressure — if they were to be disappointed with the decision taken following the vote in 2016.
“It’s about trust between our people and our political party,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here together today to say to them, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with this.’
He added in his message to the crowd: “I want you to let your political party, who is cheating from Brexit, feel pressure.
We support the army of the people of this country that won us in Brexit and we will never rest until we have become independent, self-governing, proud of Great Britain.
At the same time, EU supporters held protests in Birmingham, which ended with a two-hour protest meeting in the city center.
A small group of activists waved flags against Brexit after the group was set on foot this weekend.
Lord Adonis, of the Workers' Party, made fun of conservatives for security issues that came up in the category's telephone program when the conference was opened.
“These are the people who tell us that it can have all the computer systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, for border without barriers, for free trade with Ireland without borders,” he added.
“It’s an absolute scandal.
There is nothing that can be called good Brexit,\" he said.
Warren wants to “remember seriously” to present himself to the presidency.
Elizabeth Warren, a U.S. senator, said he would “think seriously about the presidential election after November’s elections.
According to Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat has discussed his future at a city meeting in the western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has rarely criticised Donald Trump, is offering a re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-directed in Trump's 2016 presidential campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been at the heart of the mystery that she could offer herself against Trump in 2020.
The meeting of the Holyoke on Saturday was her 36th meeting in the form of mayors with residents in her constituency, since Trump took office.
One of the members of the meeting asked her if she would like to present herself to the president.
Warren replied that it was time for “women to go to Washington and the right of our government, and then also needs a woman as a leader.”
Arrest after a deadly shooting at Sims from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that she had arrested one suspect in the case of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who was shot dead on Friday.
The police in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years in a press conference at 11 a.m.
She had previously released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a man who was seen on the recording.
Sims, aged 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus early Friday.
“Wayde Sims had a bullet wound in his head and died because of it,” said Murphy J. Paul, police chief, with the media on Saturday, according to 247sport news.
Wayde came to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being in the field, with weapons in his travels, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested and detained by the police department of East Baton Rouge.
Sims was two metres tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, he played in 32 games, 10 of which in the beginning team during the final season and played an average of 17.4 minutes, scored 5.6 points and reached 2.9 outcomes in each game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after Sebastian Vettel gives him the seat of victory by order of their team.
It was evident from the fact that Valtteri Bottas took a seat in front of Lewis Hamilton in front of the start-up on Saturday, that the orders of Mercedes's team would play a major part in the competition.
Bottas got a good start in the beginning and left Hamilton almost as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to fight against his teammates.
Vettel first went to the pit and forced Hamilton to drive into the traffic at the end of the group, but it should have been able to determine the results.
The Mercedes car went to the pit one lap later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton came out after a short battle where Ferrari's driver was forced to leave the inner side after having been at risk of being left, following defense trials in the third turn.
Max Verstappen began in the back of the group and was seventh at the end of the first circle, on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the competition as he delayed changing tires to try to finish quickly and pass out of Kimi Raikonen and reach fourth place.
He finally went to the pit in the 44th round, but couldn't increase the speed of the eight remaining rings, and Raikonen took the fourth seat.
This is a difficult day because Valtteri was doing great all weekend and was a true gentleman to let me out of the way.
“The team has been doing great to achieve this success,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body pain.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday, because of her claims that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court judge, of sexual harassment.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but did not directly discuss the testimony of Ford before the Senate ruling committee. Instead, he said that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were “bad and cruel and untruthful.”
“The only thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has been going on in the last days of the elders, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and bad and cruel and untrue,” he said.
“When you see the lights and the leaks and then you say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you do this?
Remember her answer... did you leave the document?
Oh, no.
I'm not going to let you...
Wait a minute.
“No, we didn’t, he said, and he succeeded the senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where the charges came out of Ford against Kavanaugh, and it was leaked early in September. Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
\"I didn't hide the charges of Dr. Ford, I didn't read her story,\" Feinstein told the committee, according to the news from The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it in confidence, and I did as she asked me to.
But her denial did not seem to go well into the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday: “I’ll tell you, it was really bad body stress.
Maybe she didn’t leave, but it was the worst body pain I’ve ever seen.
The president continued his defense for Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women, and suggested that Democrats were taking advantage of the allegations in their favor.
“They are determined to regain control, no matter what methods to use.
You see the brutality, the folly, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to choose over to gain control and control,” the president said, according to mediaite’s news.

Air traffic controller makes life ensure that hundreds of passengers in a plane escape from an earthquake
In Indonesia, the air traffic director has been hailed as a hero after he had his death to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers could take off the air whole and the barn.
Over 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake broke over the island of Sulawesi on Friday and launched a flood wave.
Great earthquakes continue to plague the area and many are trapped under the ruins of the city of Pala.
The 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, despite his co-workers fleeing the command tower that was violently swinging at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He was left to ensure that the Batik Air aircraft number 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake was over, could certainly be able to operate on air.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was about to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, Air Navigation spokesman, said that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News, Australia.
We prepare a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are very sad to hear about this,” he added.
The authorities fear that the number of the dead could exceed 1,000, as the country's disaster agency says that access is limited to the towns of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong.
“The number of dead people is still increasing, because many bodies are still under way and cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Up to six-metre-high centuries have caused immense destruction in Palu, where mass funerals will be held on Sunday.
The army and passenger aircraft work to bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News, “Every minute, an ambulance comes with a body.
There is little water.
The small markets have been robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said in an interview with CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross competes to find survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia, arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the army of the country: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the removal.
You are ready - said in a news report from CNN.
Earlier this year, earthquakes hit Lombok in Indonesia, where over 550 people were killed.
Flight accident in Nigeria: Air Niugini now says that it is also missing after the plane crashed into London
The airline, which had a plane that crashed into a lion in Micronesia, now says that one person is missing, having previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a statement that from the afternoon on Saturday it did not know about the departure of as male passengers.
The airline said it was working with the local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about further information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped to rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water when it tried to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Police said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and that their condition was constant.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and what exactly the series of incidents were.
The airline and Navy both said the plane had landed in the lounge just ahead of the airport.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the airport too far.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane had been very low.
“It was really good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others could swim the water and access emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the pilots were scared and screaming and that he had suffered minor headaches.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who were working from a distance to make up a dock also helped to rescue by using the bloated boat to transport people to land, before the plane sank in about 30 meters deep water.
Information from the Air Safety Agency shows that 111 people have died in the plane crash of PNG-registered aircraft for the past two decades, none of which were related to Air Niugini.
An expert describes the timeline of the night that a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors filed their lawsuit on Saturday in a re-uptake case against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert from the U.S. Department of Justice, was in the courtroom for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the court how he used mobile phone records to put together the journeys of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessicu Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, on the contrary to his previous statements, according to the news from The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber at the same time as he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said he had not been in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said it was \"a lie, because my car was in Nashville.\"
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Mobile phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted text messages, phone calls, and contact details from her phone.
“He destroyed her from his life,” said Hale.
Protectors are expected to deliver their final speech on Sunday.
The judge said that the case would be put before the court later that day.

Another black person?
New York Lawyers Lawyers for Exclusion After “Dumpful — Text Messages”
In New York, she is a lawyer for an illegal expulsion after she received a surprise text message from her mother complaining that she was “other black person.”
The couple refuses to be prejudiced and resembles the lawsuit to “coupling.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, declared discontent when she learned that her new mother, Giselle Maurice, would be black when she was able to work for the first time in 2016.
“NEEEEIIIII AN ANNUAL MANESKJA” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in text messages.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent them twice to Miss Maurice.
After discovering her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, Miss Maurice, found out that their former daughter, who was a black woman, had gone badly, and that she had expected to have a Filipsey woman, according to New York Post news.
Fr. Maurice was paid for his work day and then sent home in Uber car.
Maurice now prosecutes the couple and wants to get compensation for the expulsion, that the amount of $350 a day for the six-month job she had been initially hired, although no contract has been signed.
“I wanted to show them that you shouldn’t do this,” she said in an interview with Post on Friday and added, “I know this is a difference.
The couple objected to the allegations that they were prejudiced and said that it was the right thing to run Maurice, because they felt they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her a message she wasn’t going to say.
She's not biased.
“We are not prejudiced people,” the husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But who would trust their children after showing such rudeness, even if it was surprising?
Newborn her child?
Don't be like that.
Plasco compared the lawsuit to “revelation,” saying that his wife had arrived seven months on the way and was in “very difficult circumstances,”
Are you going to attack someone in this situation?
It is not very beautiful,\" said Plasco, who works in the investment sector.
The case is still in court, but the public has taken a hard word about the couple in social media and embarrassed it for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington’s publishers feared that readers would have difficulty speaking bear, says a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter who was born shortly after the book was approved, said of the letter: “It’s hard to get into someone’s footsteps who read it for the first time before she was released.
“It’s very funny now that we know of the immense success of Paddington’s...
She said that her father, who worked as a member of the BBC before he was inspired to write a children's book about a small toy bear, had rejected his works with calm positiveness, adding that the sixty-year-old publication of the book was \"good-natured,\" after his death last year.
As far as Paddington is concerned, as she describes as “a very important family member,” she added that her father had been silently proud of his success in the end.
“He was a very quiet man and not used to showing off,” she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child who is doing something. You’re proud of it even if you haven’t really done anything yourself.
I think he looked at the success of Paddington.
Even though Paddington was a creation and his imagination, he always gave the Paddington himself the honor.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her through the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but without success.
“Nad called regularly and told me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to survive,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me and said that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs given to her by the doctors to hold the heart rate up were gradually losing their function and being separated from the body.
She had died shortly before and it was her body to give up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing it was all happening.
I couldn’t climb or scream or cry, because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to control myself.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned her deceased daughter, went aboard the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the difficulties she experienced.
“No one knew anything,” she said.
“I pulled my head and the tears fell all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt great compassion with Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
A sad woman hangs a message to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who had loved ones who committed suicide now try to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up a message on a bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and phone numbers that people can call and receive assistance.
Tyler, the son of Miss Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel like I have to feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney and said her son had been a successful cook with a contagious smile.
“He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could set up any room.
He stopped working before he died, because he was “dried down into a very dark place.”
In 2014, Brother Tyler, aged 11, found his brother dead after taking his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that it’s going to be a result of it.
Miss Davis created the message to let people know that it is possible to go and talk to others, even a friend.
Don't sit and say nothing - you need to talk to someone...
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, his spouse to 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t talk about his suffering or being depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He was at his worst on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts he did not look at them or anything...
She said that his death was a great shock to them, but that they had to earn themselves out of it: “This breaks a hole in the family.
This will break us apart.
But we have to go on and fight...

The future of Brett Kavanaughs hangs on a blue thread that the FBI has its investigation
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for — a research with limited time and scope — we might be able to get a little along,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he feared that the committee was “to be broken down — in the middle of a dispute between the parties where everything was in a backlock.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his supporters from the Republican Party not want the FBI to investigate the matter?
Their slowness is due to the timing.
The mid-term discussions are in just five weeks, on the 6th of November. If the Republicans are going badly, as expected, they weaken their serious attempts to have their men elected to sit in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush has been calling senators to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met Ashley, his wife through him, but she was the author of Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes its investigation report?
A vote will be held at the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit as it is.
It is still not known whether Mr Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, but it would allow the Vice President Mike Pence to break up the draw and confirm it in the office of the Supreme Court.
The number of people fleeing North Korea, under Kim’s command
The number of people fleeing North Korea and going to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean senator.
Park Byeong victory, quoted data from the South Korea Cooperation Council and said that 1127 people had fled last year, based on 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border alerts between North Korea and China and higher charges overcrowded by smugglers with people were key factors.
Pyongyang has not issued any official statement.
Most of those fleeing North Korea are invited to receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people flee to China, but it has the longest border on North Korea, and it is easier to cross it than it is for the more neutral region between North and South Korea.
China sees refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which still have in war, have technically improved significantly over the past month.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for discussions focused mainly on delayed nuclear nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This was after a historic meeting in June between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work together in the direction of nuclear-free Koreans.
On Saturday, however, Ri Yong Ho, Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, taught American business requests about the lack of progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, no one is certain of the security of our country and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to take down our nuclear weapons one-sided first,” said Ri in his speech to the General Assembly of the United States in New York City.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh \"murder\" and says he is unable to perform the job of Supreme Court Justice
Nancy Pelosi, the head of the minority in the conference, called Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court judge, “mortal disease,” and told him that he could work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi interviewed these words on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had ever been like this, she would have been called maternally ill,” Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate ruling committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the allegations that he had harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both young.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional and sometimes ran up close to a cry and had a cake in his neck when discussing his family and school years.
He also publicly condemned Democrats in the committee and called the charges against him “an infamous and organized genocide — organised by liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton’s loss of the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, for he showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
“I think that these statements and how he attacked the Clintons and Democrats show that he is ineligible for the job,” she said.
Pelosi did not answer when asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh fired from work if confirmed and if Democrats reach the majority of Congress.
“I’ll say this: if he’s not telling the Congress or the FBI the truth, then he’s not only unfit to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he’s now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now serving as a judge in Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Kavanaughs against the Affordable Care Act or the birth laws of Roe v. Wade, where he is considered to be a conservative judge.
At the hearing, Kavanaugh faced questions as to whether he would reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is no time for a motherly, biased person to go to high court and expect us to say “very much it’s wonderful,” Pelosi said.
And women need to take advantage of it.
This is a fair speech, months and years of anger flowing out of it, and it doesn’t come out of it without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” said Dr. Steinem to me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, but you...
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager somewhere and said she was crying too when she got angry, but she had developed technology so that when she got angry and started crying, she said to her lawyer, “You think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was great.
Tears are allowed to express anger in part because they are misunderstood in fundamentals.
One of my most clear memories of the previous job I did in an office with men in the majority, where I began to cry out of the anger I could not express, came an older woman and took to the back of my neck. She was a cold boss that I had always feared and she pulled me into the stairs.
“Don’t let them see you cry,” she said to me.
They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and happy to have reached you.

In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a firestorm on board a ship named Monkey Business (Apaspil) and pulled his bid back, Ms. Schroeder, full regret, stated that there was no reason why she could not consider offering herself to the president.
“It wasn’t a well thought out decision,” she said, laughing at me, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone gave this name, “Middle White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As far as the election campaign was concerned, she was waiting for funding, so she said she would not offer anything unless she was able to collect $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“They say I’m going to get a discount, she’s wondering.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not formally present herself, she was so overwhelmed by feelings - grateful to the people who had supported her, complaining about the system, which made it so difficult to obtain money and direct her eyes to voters instead of representatives, and anger into the sensory difference - that she burst into tears.
“I might have had a nervous breakdown,” said Ms. Schroeder, who recalls how the media responded.
\"It would seem that Cleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my gravestone?
“She cried...
Reasons that a trade war between the United States and China could be good for Beijing
The first shootings in the trade war between the United States and China were honest, and although the war is far from over, the gap between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing for a long-term perspective, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, shot the first warning shot earlier this year by taxing the main export products of China, including solar batteries, steel and aluminium.
This week, the most upscale came with new tariffs that cover products worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), and tax as much as half of all products that are imported into the United States from China.
Peking has responded in the same coin each time and recently placed 5 to 10 percent of customs on U.S. products worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to respond to US customs clearance, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy of the world will soon be under way.
In order to get Washington to pile up, demands have to be made, but it would be far too demeaning for Xi Jinping, President of China to bow publicly to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing holds the right card, pressure from the trade war with the United States could have a positive impact on China in the long term, by reducing the mutual need for both parties.
“The fact that speeding political decisions either in Washington or Beijing could lead to the situation leading to economic collapse in each country is actually more dangerous than the viewers have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses mainly on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syrians are ready to return, the Minister of Foreign Affairs said.
Syria claims to be ready for refugees to return to the country and seek help to rebuild the country, which is now in bad condition after seven years of war.
Mr. Walid al Moualem, Foreign Minister spoke to the UN General Assembly, saying that conditions in the country improved.
“Today, the situation on earth is more stable and safer, thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to come to a normal situation by building up areas that were destroyed by terrorists.
All is now ready for refugees to return to the country they were forced to leave for terrorism and one-sided economic decisions aimed at their daily lives and jobs.
It is estimated that over 5.5 million Syrians fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million more people still living in the country need help.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian authorities would be happy to accept assistance in rebuilding the country.
He stressed, however, that they would not accept aid subject to conditions or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the U.S. team with the 16.5 final score against 10.5 points on the Le Golf National field outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a series of European countries and has not won Ryder Cups in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown once again when the team, led by Danish leader Thomas Bjorn, reached the 14.5 points it needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had the most difficulty of all the competition, struck his initial blow into the water of the 16th hole, which is par 3, and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone brightly in all of his games and became 1 of 4 players to get the conclusion 05-0, since the competition began to use its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 against Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, but he was at the bottom of the ranking of the players in the European team.
Dustin Johnson, in the top spot on the list of the best golfers in the world, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England who played possibly in his last race for the Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times about the Ryder Cup, became the most successful European race with a 25.5 score.
“I don’t cry, but today I can’t do anything else.
This has been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to get the cup back.
It’s about the team, and it was my pleasure to be able to help,” said the emotional Garcia after Europe’s victory.
He directs his country to John Rahm, but he defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a solo game on Sunday.
“I was incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him,” said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and is now registered with 13-21-3 in the competition for the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange result for one of the best players in history, which has won 14 major titles and is only in a second place after Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had difficulty all weekend finding themselves on the field, outside Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a good game throughout the race.
The U.S. team, Jim Furyk, said after disappointment with the performance of their team, \"I'm proud of them, they fought.
It was in the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him.
I'm taking over for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players play very well.
We get back together, I will work with the PGA in the United States and call Ryder the cup and we will continue.
I love these 12 men and am proud to be their leader.
You have to take it down.
They played better than us.
