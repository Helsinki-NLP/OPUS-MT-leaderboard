Welsh Members of Parliament do not want to appear as \"muppets\"
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, known today under the abbreviation AM (Assembly Members), are not entirely satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes from the plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives from all over the political spectrum fear that this can lead to ridicule.
A representative from the Labour Party explained his group was worried because “it rhymes on Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means \"dustete\", and pwp means \"bish\".
A representative of the Wales party Plaid Cymru said that the group in its entirety was \"dissatisfied\" and that they have proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh part of the Conservative Party said his group was \"open\" for the name change, but noted that the pronunciation of MWP is very close to the word \"Muppet\", which as well as being the name of some famous dolls, is also a British slang word for \"dust\".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced in a similar manner to the letter U is pronounced in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like an \"uh\" sound.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the name change, said: “Of course, it is the members themselves who have the latest right of determination in relation to the name with which they are to be referred to.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation showing public support to rename the National Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the representatives' title, the Commission supported WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members), but the MWP option received the most support during the public consultation.
The representatives apparently propose other alternatives, but to have all parties reach an agreement may lead to a head breach for President Elin Jones, who is scheduled to deliver a legislative draft for the name change in the next couple of weeks.
The legislation on the reform will include other changes in the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on disqualification of representatives and the design of the committee system.
Representatives have the last right to vote on what to call them when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to decide if the country's name should be changed
Sunday, the people of Macedonia can vote on whether their country's name should be changed to \"Republic of North Macedonia\".
The referendum is held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has a region named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbor constitutes a requirement for their territory and has, on several occasions, opposed the country's applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum for the name change, has said that he will ignore the vote.
People's vote supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price they have to pay to participate in the EU and NATO.
Watches in St. Martin's Stylner - The Crickets in Harlem
“The old ones I spoke to have told me that before the time there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“Now there are none of the parts.”
He said that the fallout of the bars was understandable.
“People socially interact in other ways,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the local community’s meeting places, all of which visit regularly.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders believe, “And sooner or later they are back at the beginning.”
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment building full of the kind of people who will not help the neighbourhood's remaining sanctuary.
\"The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,\" he says, \"and will therefore only speed up the day when these churches must close their doors for good, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.\"
Both of the chalks were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolitan community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had been nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's got a black congregation under priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of dealers on 125th Street - one of Harlem's main craftsmen - because they failed to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, and when Father Johnson's parish children made plans for the reconstruction, they bought a carillon.
Prest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly declared that the carillonet was \"the church bells of the poor people\".
The expert who played the carillonet in July called it something else: “a cultural tax” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillonet in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillonet at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's has never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's in the past couple of months is a complicated interaction between architects and contractors, some of which are initiated by the church's lay people's leadership and others by the diocese.
The Council of Churches, the leadership of the congregation, consisting of laymen, wrote to the diocese in July about its concern that the diocese would “try to force the costs” of the Council, despite the fact that the Council had not been involved in the introduction of the architects or contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parish children complained of lack of openness on the part of the diocese.
Hai damages thirteen years of age on lobster diving in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he appeared after lobster in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:30 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help, and that he and a group of others swam over to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy cried out of enthusiasm to have caught a lobster, but he eventually realized that the boy shouted, 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!\"
His entire collar bone was torn up,\" said Hammel, who discovered the damage when he reached the boy.
“I cried out that everyone had to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he continued to be in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is not known.
Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper torso.
The authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to make its take on the UK beauty care market
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with warehouse-like makeup and beauty nursing shelves, staffed by specially trained staff.
The extended shelves are tested out in 11 shops around the country as part of a powerful entry into the UK 2.8 million beauty care market, which is constantly experiencing growth while the sales figures for clothing and home items fall. If the attempt turns out to be successful, the concept will be extended to several stores next year.
The investment in beauty care is a result of the supermarket's attempts to find a new use for the space previously used for TVs, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury's has said that they should double the number of beauty care products they offer to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the store chain has never sold before.
Existing product selections from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also get better space in labeled brands, in the same way as in stores like Boots.
The supermarket chain also relaunches its Boutique brand with mainly vegan products, because there is growing demand for this among younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer The Fragrance Shop will test out sales tables in two Sainsbury's stores. One opened in Croydon, South London last week, while the other will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Net trading and a new trend to buy small amounts of food daily from local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that sales are eventually going to look more and more like a department store, as the supermarket addresses the fight against cheap shops Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods outside of food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets after purchasing both chains two years ago. According to them, this has increased food sales and has made the acquisitions more profitable.
The first attempt by the supermarket to upgrade the departments of beauty care and pharmacy products was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration was discontinued after a dispute regarding the distribution of revenue from the pharmacies in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy pharmacy chain, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a selection of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Trade Director, said: \"We have transformed the appearance and design of the beauty nursing shelves to create more inviting surroundings for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who are going to be ready to provide advice and help.
Our selection of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the inviting surroundings and practical locations now make us a beauty-seeking contest representing a new shopping experience.”
Peter Jones is \"raising\" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from an appointment worth GBP 11 million
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones is alleged to be furious after TV host Holly Willoughby resigned from an 11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time for their home and accessories brand, Truly.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand, Goop.
Willoughby (37) who is the host of this Morning announced on Instagram that she is leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' Den star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle brand in the last second to focus on his own new gold-lined contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was \"raveling\" at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. This is where the television's golden girl admitted that her new deals - worth up to GBP 1.5 million - mean that she no longer has time to go over to their clothing and accessories brand, Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand, Goop, and it was expected that it would double Willoughby’s estimated fortune on GBP 11 million.
While Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she will leave Truly, Jones left Britain on her way to one of her vacation homes.
One source said: “Truly was undoubtedly Holly’s first priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her financial security over the next decades.
Everyone is shocked that she has chosen to resign.
No one could believe it when it happened last Tuesday - it was just before the launch.
Now a warehouse is full of goods at Marlow headquarters that are now ready for sale.\"
Experts believe that this Morning programme manager, who is among the UK’s most popular stars, may cost the company several million pounds due to large investment in products such as pillows and light, fashion and coseals, as well as a potential delay in the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Three-child mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became chairman of the board in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin hosting the ITV program I'm A Celebrity.
A source that stands near Jones said yesterday, \"We will not comment on his business affairs.\"
“And then we fell in love”
He made a joke about the criticism he would receive from the news media for making a comment some would consider “small presidentialism,” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his imitation of a news anchor.
“I haven’t given anything away.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a new meeting, having himself declared that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a big dirty road to nuclear disarmament by North Korea.
But the talks on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a \"similar response\" from the United States on its early disarmament measures.
He noted that the United States still has sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure up.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when speaking for an assembly of his voters.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
\"We were going to war against North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said that his work to improve Kim's relationship has yielded positive results, such as putting an end to rocket tests, helping to get released hostages and getting the remains after U.S. officials sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about Kim's relationship.
\"It's easy to act with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this stuffy arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right here,\" Trump said pointing to the area right in front of them.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia breed an island and kills hundreds of people
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-profit organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Despite more than 10% of Lombox residents had lost their homes, a national disaster was not declared, which is a requirement for international assistance to be sent in.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it quite clear that they are not asking for international help, so it is quite challenging,” Sumbung explained.
Save the children now put together a team to travel to Palu, but are not yet sure if foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the national emergency management agency, said Indonesian authorities are considering the situation in Palu to see if international organizations should be allowed to contribute to the relief work.
Considering the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly exposed to, the country is terribly ill prepared to deal with the anger of nature.
Ly to protect against tsunamis is built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a Palu warning zone, although an alert had been issued, has likely contributed to the death penalty.
Even in the best circumstances, it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made an upgrade to Indonesia’s fall-out infrastructure a key point in his campaign and has spent a lot of money on road and rail.
But money shortages have been a major problem for Joko’s administration, which will be re-elect next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from constant sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have switched to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machets, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge with late equalization in fight against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Premier League losses against Chelsea on Saturday by scoring for 89 minutes in the game at Stanford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from the Chelsea goal while his team was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to his left foot before sending it to the longest corner.
The experiment went high over the box as the ball fell to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally went over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I just tried to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq always send the ball forward as well as it can be done, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come and touched the ball once and didn’t think too much about it and just kicked it off.”
Chelsea led by 1-0 at the break, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal for 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker sent a pass with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic, before changing direction near the midfield and sprinted into Liverpool's orbital half.
Kovacic made a quick delivery on the midfield.
He then fired off a great breakthrough pass that brought Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner met a left foot kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool plays against Naples in the group game of the Champions League at 15.00 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo, Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in the European League for Men in London at 15.00 on Thursday.
The deaths of the tsunami in Indonesia reached 832
The deaths following Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami have risen to 832, announced the country's emergency management agency early on Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake with a string of 7.5 people hit the country on Friday causing waves of up to six meters, the agency spokesperson Sutpo Purwo Nugroho explained at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of materials from demolished buildings.
Police arrest man (32) for murder after a woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation is underway after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with stab wounds at 7:55 p.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street. A 32-year-old man is arrested, suspected of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard something about contacting.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: \"We are at the very beginning of the investigation, but I want to ask anyone who was in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
We also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have picked up something on their car camera, to contact - they may have information that is crucial for our investigation.\"
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the deceased woman was resident in Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived at the scene to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police have said they are working to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been told that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will take several hours for them to get back in.
A police officer was overheard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She repeats \"it's so horrible\" over and over again.
At 14 a.m., two police cars were behind the barrier, while a third car was just outside.
A number of police officers were outside the barrier and had overseeing the apartment complex.
Persons who have information are asked to send a direct message to @MerpolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, by referring to \"log 247\" from September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last memorial to be drawn into the argument about \"rewriting history\"
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Comwell Society history team has described Jeremy Crick's publisher as \"obvious\" and \"an attempt to re-write history\".
John Goldsmith, leader of the Cromwell Society, says: “It was inevitable in the current debate regarding the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside the Westminster Palace also came to be a goal.
The English Civil War iconoclasm was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's stunning representation of Cromwell is a proof of the 19th century opinions and is part of historiography of a man many people still think deserves to be praised.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell becomes by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, regarded as Parliament’s defender against outside pressure — in his time, of course, there was talk about the monarchy.
Whether this is a very accurate representation is still the subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering.\"
Drapsgris kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on his market in southwestern China, according to local news reports.
The man, mentioned only with the surname “Yuan”, was found dead and covered with blood from a torn artery near a binge on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to put vaccines on pigs on a farm on May 30, 2005 in the city of Xining, Qinghai province of China.
He had apparently traveled with his cousin from neighbouring province Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead, and discovered that the gate of a nearby pig's path was open.
He said that inside the swinepath there was a big wrong with blood on his mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had killed the man.
\"The legs of my cousin were bloody and painted,\" the cousin, referred to as the surname Wu, explained in a quote to Guiyang Evening News.
Recording from surveillance cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
While the police gathered evidence from the scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else.
Yuan's family and market management apparently negotiates compensation for the death.
Although it happens the source, it is not the first time it is recorded that a pig has attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple at a farm in Massachusetts, severely damaging the man.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pushed up against a tractor and attacked by a pig of 300 kg until the farmer's wife managed to chase the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to CBC News explained that pigs are not aggressive to common but that the taste of blood can have a trigger effect.
\"They're just playing.
They like to bite, and are very curious... they're not trying to hurt anyone.
You just have to show enough respect.\"
The rest of Hurricane Rosa will lead to heavy rain in the southwestern United States
As reported, Hurricane Rosa is weakened as it moves over the cooler sea on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry flood rain on his journey through North Mexico and the South West United States in the next few days.
Rosa had a wind force of 135 km/h and was a hurricane of category 1 at 5:00 ET on Sunday, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a train begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves east towards the west coast of the United States. It approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin pushing tropical humidity northwards to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the interaction between tropical humidity and the tree that approaches will lead to widespread heavy rain in the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous flooding, liquid debris and rapid and possible landslide in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will lead to rainfall rates of up to 5-7 cm per hour in some areas, especially areas south of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5-10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There are opportunities for flooding with rapidly exacerbated conditions due to the scattered tropical rain.
It is very unwise to move around in the desert on foot as long as there is a danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can cause river valleys to become wide-ranging roaring rivers, and thunder will lead to local winds that may contain dust and sand.
The tree that approaches will cause local heavy rain showers for parts of the coast along South California.
Total rainfall over 1.3 cm is possible, and this can lead to liquid debris and fast, as well as smooth roadways.
This will be the first rain of the area.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and endure all Wednesday.
October can lead to some intense temperature fluctuations across the United States as the Arctic becomes colder but the tropics remain very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We will see a clear example of powerful temperature differences throughout the Central United States on Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, sustained summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the Central and East United States will likely get a warm start on October, with degrees high in the twentieth century from Southern Plains to parts of the north-east United States.
New York City can reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday - this will be approximately 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate message indicates that East America will most likely have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers, distributed on six television networks, saw Thursday's gripping testimony from Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused him of a sexual assault that was reported to have taken place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political feud continued, and broadcasters interrupted their regular broadcasts to announce Friday’s great surprise in the last second, when it emerged that the Senator of Arizona, Jeff Flake, had arranged for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate court committee that she is 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh touched her and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he is 100 percent certain that this did not happen.
The shipment on Friday was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated the average viewing figures for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
View figures were not immediately available to other networks that showed the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring office viewers.
To provide some perspective, this series is equivalent to the final game of the U.S. Football Championship or the Oscar Award.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts have supported Kavanaugh's appointment with great enthusiasm, led among the networks, with average viewer numbers of 5.69 million for the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.99 million, and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still great after the hearing.
Flake was the main character of Friday's drama.
The moderate Republican's office made a statement that he came to vote in Kavanaugh's favor. On Friday morning he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras trying to take the elevator to a meeting in the court committee while protesters screamed and shouted at him.
He stood with lower glances for several minutes while being scolded, while the incident was sent directly to CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” a woman said.
\"Do you think he's telling our country the truth?\"
He was told that “you have power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake pointed out that his office has made a statement, saying that the elevator doors closed that he would have more to say about the matter at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all the hearings directly several hours later, when the court committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should be continued to the entire Senate for voting.
But Flake said he was only willing to do this if the FBI examined the charges against the candidate next week, which the Democratic minority has urged.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flake's choice had a big impact, as it was clear that Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of \"political game\" around Brexit
In an interview with the newspaper The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused the opponents of her plan to leave the EU to run \"political games\" with the future of Britain and undermine the interests of the nation.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, printed side by side with her own on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson has continued her attack on her so-called \"Chequers\" plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to capture each other's tariffs was \"very ridiculous\".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of causing the LSU player's death
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) is arrested and charged with deliberate murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities have released a video recording of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the bazaar roof.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS partner WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting and killing Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, according to The Advocate.
The coroner of East Baton Rouge Parish published a preliminary report on Friday, stating the cause of death as a shot wound in the head and through the neck.
Police are grateful to the Louisiana State Police working group for the capture of refugees, state police labs, Southern University police and locals for contributions to the investigation that led to an arrest.
LSU Sports Leader Joe Alleva thanked the area's police force for his \"hard work and pursuit of justice\".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m high forward player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team is \"crushed\" and \"in shock\" after Wayde's death.
“This is what we fear at all times,” Wade said.
Volcano sprays ash over Mexico City
The ash spraying out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The Centro Nacional de Prevención de Desastres, Mexico's state emergency prevention agency, warned Mexico's population on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after the activity rose in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within a day.
The agency monitored several cases of bulging and shaking.
Social media images showed a thin layer of ash covering front routes on the cars in neighborhoods such as Xochimilco, Mexico City.
Geophysicists have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is 72 km southeast of the capital after an earthquake of 7.1 shaken central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as \"Don Goyo\", has been active since 1994.
Police in clashes with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protesters for independence had a clash with the police, while several thousand participated in competing protests to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on separation.
A group of masked separatists were held back by riot police, bombing them with eggs and powder paint, causing dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
The hand also broke out later in the day, when police used batons to limit fighting.
For several hours, independence protesters stood and shouted \"Never forget, never forgive\", face to face with unionist protesters shouting \"Long live Spain\".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they received during the protests, according to the local press.
The tension is still high in the liberation-oriented region one year after the October 1 referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming majority of dissipation, but it was a bad turn because the vote was boycotted by most who opposed the liberation.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after police tried to stop the vote held at polling stations across the region.
Liberation groups camped in the streets night to Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration was suspended, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who attended the separatist proletariat with his wife, said that he no longer had hopes of Catalonia's ability to become independent.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy in getting a voice, but now we're stuck,\" he said.
Despite achieving a narrow but crucial victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalan independence have had problems keeping pressure up this year, as many of their bitterly-known leaders have travelled in self-imposed exile or are in custody while awaiting trial for their role in arranging the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest to support police, said that the conflict was heated by politicians on both sides.
\"The situation is becoming more and more tense,\" he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in jail waiting for a trial since late last year, announced that he will be running in the European Parliament next year.
“To stand for election as a candidate in the European election is the best I can do to condemn the oppression and regression from the democratic values we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car was driven several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Mengas attacks lead to Livingston's 1-0 victory against Rangers
Dolly Mengas first goal for Livingston secured victory
Raised Livinston amazed Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
A good match from Dolly Menga proved to be crucial, and Gary Holt's side is now similar to Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side has still not won away in the Premier League this season and will play against leaders Hearts, which is eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers will play home match against Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on his part, has remained undefeated through six games in the division. Chief coach Holt has not yet lost a game after replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston is missing opportunities for its dull guests
Holt’s team should have led long before they scored, as their direct method caused countless problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but missed the goal, and Alan Lithgow could only send fired further to slide in to meet Craig Halkett's header past the target.
The hostship allowed Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could make problems for their guests at deathball.
And that is how the crucial goal came to.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston found an opening — Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga clear orbit, and he scored a goal from the middle of the box.
By this stage, Rangers had the ball pretty much all the time, but the home team's defense had proven to be impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed a near-scoring that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by Rangers keeper Allan McGregor's feet, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston deadball in a long short pass.
Crossings still came into the Livingston box and were still saved, while two criminal charges — once after Halkett’s protest against the replacements of Glenn Middleton, and once by hand — were overlooked.
\"Penomenal\" from Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were all amazing, and continue to exceed all expectations on the way up.
The style of play and the crew have hardly changed since they got on top again, but Holt is said to have a lot of credit for the way he has strengthened the team after his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and coordinated a huge well-organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worral on his toe throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, did not have my inspiration to separate.
Although at times they have been very good under Gerrard, they failed to live up to this standard.
The last part of the game was labs - they only got into the home team's track half once - and it was a bit of a wake-up for the Rangers, located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just smile and blue sky on Saturday 29 September, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the NATO allies.
There has been a split on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police stated security as the reason why a crowd of 25,000 were not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many followers met up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also left their voices and criticized both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to let him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the split that follows a man who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocratic by others.
Deptford collision: Cyclist killed in collision by car
A cyclist is killed in a collision as with a car in London.
The collision took place at the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a busy road in Deptford southeast of the city, around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by ambulance personnel, but the man died on site.
The collision takes place only one month after a cyclist died in a crash where the driver escaped from the scene of Children's Street, about a mile from Saturday's collision.
Metropolitan Police said police are working to identify the man and alert the relatives.
Roads and busses are in place, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers are injured in an incident at a high security prison for men, according to the prison authorities.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 p.m. BST on Sunday, and are still ongoing.
Specialized \"Tornado\" officers have been brought in to handle the incident, involving eight inmates and are limited to one wing.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries on the site.
A prison service spokesperson said: “Sepine-trained prison personnel have been sent in to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons - those responsible will be transferred to the police, and may have to spend even more time behind lock and beat.\"
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison officer received hospital care after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, the rebel police were called to deal with a serious incident in which employees were attacked with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (may be beneficial for drought areas)
It is the source Arizona is hit by a tropical lobe, but it will probably happen early next week, as Hurricane Rosa's remaining force moves through the desert areas of the southwest and carries flood hazards.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona into southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rain will start late Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has noted on Twitter that only \"ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storms or lobes within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from Arizona's border.\"
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 5-10 cm of rainfall, with up to 15 cm in some places in Mongollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas within the south-west desert, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin mountain range, will likely get between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of precipitation is possible in some areas.
For those outside floodfare, Rosa can be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although floods are a serious problem, some of this rainfall will probably be beneficial, since the Southwestern United States is currently in a drought state.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, little more than 40 percent of Arizona experience at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa hits land at the Mexican Peninsula Baja California.
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with maximum wind speed of 137 km, is 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves 19 km/h.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, thus losing power.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with tropical storm forces on Monday night or afternoon.
The rainfall of parts of Mexico can be severe and cause great flooding.
\"Total rainfall of 7.5 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with possibilities for up to 25 cm of precipitation\", according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits Arizona's border early Tuesday morning as a tropical lobe, which thisr moves on through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
\"The main danger expected by Rosa or the remains of it is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the Southwestern desert of the United States\", according to the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall is expected to produce dangerous floods and liquid debris and rapid in the desert and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsome Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man are arrested, suspected of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teen boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area by Midsome Norton around 4:00 BST on Sunday.
He was taken to hospital, and his condition should be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
Police have asked anyone who may have mobile recordings of the incident to contact.
Trump says Kavanaugh has “suffered under the humility and mind” of the Democratic Party
\"A voice to support Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party,\" Trump said in front of a referendum in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has “suffered under the smallness and mind” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, denying the powerful and emotional charges of Christine Blasey Ford that he committed a sexual assault on her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford is also testified about his charge during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that \"the American people saw how brilliant, skillful and brave\" Kavanaugh was that day.
\"A voice to support Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to support one of the most skilled lawyers of our time, with spotless vandalism in public service,\" he told a assembly of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred the debate to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of how important it is for Republicans to vote in the middle elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of our lifetime’s most important choices.
I’m not really a participant, but I’m a participant,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going around fighting for the best candidates.”
Trump claimed that Democrats aim to \"resist and prevent\".
The Senate's first mid-term vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to the assistant of a leader of the Republican Party has said to CNN.
Hundreds of killed by Indonesian landslide and tsunami, numbers are expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were pulled out to sea by huge waves dubbed against the beaches when a large earthquake and a tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Slawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters of high waves flooded in land around the sunset, destroyed everything in their path and dragged many into the death of drowning.
The tsunami came into the heels of an earthquake with magnitude 7.5.
\"When the tsunami danger occurred yesterday, people were still doing activities on the beach, did not escape immediately and ended up as victims,\" said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's Department of Crisis Management (BNBP) at a Jakarta press conference.
\"Tsunami was not alone - it carried cars, wooden trunks and houses, hit everything on land,\" Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coastline.
Some climbed into trees to escape from the tsunami and survive.”
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photography published by the crisis management site showed many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and crushed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershock continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The number of earthquakes could be felt by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s agency for the assessment and use of technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the power of Friday’s huge earthquake was about 200 times more than the power of the nuclear bomb dropped over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami larger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the damage as “excellent” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the death tolls and damage can be larger land coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area named Dongala, which is closer to the heart of the earthquake.
Communication \"was completely distorted, completely without information\" from Dongala, according to Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there,” said the Red Cross in a press release, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not informing that a tsunami had struck Palu, but the authorities said the waves had been taken before the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building cries desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching passers-by on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water comes rolling towards the beach, tearing up buildings and cars.
Reuters have not been able to immediately authenticate the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power breach that has hindered communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The military has begun to send transport aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other essentials.
The city's airport is only open for relief work and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The deaths following the tsunami in Indonesia are rising above 800.
It's absolutely cruel.
World Vision staff from Dongala have safely reached the center of Palu, where they have sought shelter under the tarp in the courtyard in front of their office, but they passed great destruction on the road, according to Doseba Sinay.
“They told me they saw hundreds of ruined houses,” he said.
It's absolutely cruel.
As aid organizations began the dire preparations to deliver emergency aid, some complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released in an emergency area until it is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘Greit, this is a national disaster’, we can open the borders for international help, but the situation has not yet got any status.”
As the sun goes down over Palu for the second time after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those who are still missing hope that their loved ones will be among the miracle stories that brighten the gloomy news picture after tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was caught out of a sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was freed by rescuers after spending two days trapped under ruins with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paraglides for the Asian Games, which were conducted earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those caught in the ruins of Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandavi, were also his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional should carry,” he said.
Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding environment, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the performers who participated in the Palu beach festival.
However, the messages only led to gray chin marks, rather than a pair of blue chin marks.
“I think it means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal USD 26,750 during ATM filling in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole $26,755 from a Brink's worker who filled a minibank in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver had emptied a minibank in the entertainment complex and got ready to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While busy, another man was “running up behind the Brink's employee” and stealing a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses then discover several suspects escape from the scene, according to the press release, but police have not specified how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity must contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes its name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The creature formerly known as Kanye West.”
West (41) has had the nickname Ye for a long time, and used the name as the title of its eighth album, launched in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the program, after she canceled on \"emotional basis\", according to the seriesmaker.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious significance for him.
\"I think 'yes' is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you',\" said West earlier this year, discussing the album title with the Big Boy radio host.
“So I’m you, I’m us, it’s us.
It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye - as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more a representation of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, which has previously collaborated with West, has also varied between the use of dashes and large letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's incoming President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has sworn that he will never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he \"will never ever use the military to suppress the Mexican people\".
Military troops fired at a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, during a period when left-wing student movements took root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double financial support for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, investor and practitioner of artificial intelligence, which has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements on artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the United States generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, on its part, introduced a plan last year and aims to be number 1 in the field of innovation for artificial intelligence by 2030.
“A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough,” Lee said.
Double financial support can double the chance that the next great achievement in artificial intelligence comes from the United States,” Lee told CNBC this week in an interview.
Lee, whose book \"AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order\" was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading companies of artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop an artificial intelligence system that defeated the best Othello player in the United States, and later was a head of Microsoft Research or Director of Google’s Chinese Department.
Lee recognized the U.S. government's previous technology competition, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one will be held, to help find the next generation's wise heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government grants, according to Lee.
“It’s not China that steals the academic leaders, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired wise heads from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen its efforts in artificial intelligence.
\"I believe that those who have a doctoral degree in artificial intelligence should receive an offer of residence permit automatically,\" he said.
China State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the development of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation funds people at academic institutions, in a similar way to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations are distributing money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defense Department et Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative named AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, they are currently investing more than USD 100 million in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the U.S. legislation that aims to establish a national artificial intelligence security commission has been stopped for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether the country's name should be changed
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to \"Republic of North Macedonia\" to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their efforts to join the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province named Macedonia, believes that the name of the northern neighbor constitutes a requirement for Greek territory, and has vetoed against including them in NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new hub, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts whether the attendance will meet the minimum requirement of 50 percent, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: \"Are you for NATO and EU membership when approving the agreement with Greece.\"
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that originated after Yugoslavia's fall, to be able to gain membership in organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU’s protective umbrella, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, it is likely to be crucial because a high enough number of Members have said that they will comply with the results of the vote.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission has said that they had not received any irregularities reports by 13.00.
However, the attendance was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
\"I came to vote because of my children - we belong in Europe,\" said Gjose Tanevski (62) who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The referendum in Macedonia is about changing the country's name to open the doors for them to become members of NATO and the EU.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) clarified a small scene and brought forward chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the vote.
\"We are positive to NATO and the EU, but we will be reported with raised heads, not being let in the back of the way,\" Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they will not accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of euroasian integration.\"
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will lead badly needed investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think most people will be for, because more than 80 of our residents want us to become a member of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He says that a “yes” response will be a “confirmion of our future.”
According to a survey published last Monday by the Institute of Political Research, between 30 and 43 percent of eligible voters will participate in the referendum — this is lower than the required attendance.
Another study conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the attendance must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will constitute the first serious political obstacle the pro-Western government has faced since it took over in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero maneuvers past all Brighton's defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a goal for 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a pass at the beginning of the sequence.
He raced for three Brighton defenders before getting out on the open track.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender before running from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a pass to the left that reached Sterling.
The English attacker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used right shoes to beat Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
\"Aguero still struggles with a few foot problems,\" City manager Pep Guardiola told the press.
\"We talked about him playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
Fortunately, he scored a goal right then.\"
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the original advantage of the Premier League game.
This goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball put in Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough pass along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a couple of touches before leading Sterling to the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the net just before it was over the dead line.
City plays against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be the spoiler for Rockies
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs, and have no reason to be strong.
However, the always equally competitive Scherzer hopes to be on the field on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoffs of the Colorado team, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers with one game in NL West.
Rockies won a wild card with a 5-2 win over Nationals Friday night, but is still looking to secure his first division title.
Even if we have nothing to win, at least we can play with the knowledge that the mood here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will be the most likely to be the highest level of battle I get played on this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to take part in it?”
The Nationals have still not announced their starting pitcher for Sunday, but are allegedly inclined to take Scherzer pitche in such a situation.
Shenzser, who in that case is starting pitcher for the 34th time, had a blast session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has won 18 games and lost 7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump People's Assembly in West Virginia
The president referred the debate to the situation around the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republicans voting in the mid-elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not a participant, but I'm a participant, that's why I'm going around fighting for the best candidates,\" he said.
Trump continued, \"You see this cruel, cruel group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power back at all costs.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to overtake to gain power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, aim to \"resist and prevent\".
\"And you see it over the last four days,\" he said, calling the Democrats \"no, no, no, no, no.
He referred to the Senate court committee and mentioned Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, where the public lived loudly.
“Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Um, um, what.
No, no, I'm expecting one -- it was very bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen.\"
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They do not tolerate people who say their opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a number of Labour Members who have been told that we are not welcome, just because we say what we mean.
My colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I had to be censored because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
As to how important it is to have responsible economic policies, regarding national security, about Europe - ironically, similar cases that they Jeremy disagreed with former leaders about.
At the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday evenings have been exactly this.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the mood of many of the meetings, and the promise of “softer, kinder” policy is too long forgotten if at all it ever began.
It becomes increasingly apparent that different opinions are not allowed in the Labour Party, and all opinions are judged based on whether they are acceptable for party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I previously thought I shared many political positions with suddenly began to expect me to take a U-turn and stand for opinions I had never previously agreed with, either on the national security or on the EU's internal market.
When I speak publicly - and it doesn’t matter what I say - I receive a wealth of ugly messages on social media that require me to be dismissed, condemns downtown politics, and tells me that I shouldn’t be in Labour.
And it’s not just me who has experienced this.
I know that I am more fortunate than any of my colleagues because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they encounter a sea that gender discrimination and racist comments every day, but never let themselves cow.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how gross décor has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to everyone, and every mistrust proposal and every change to the electoral rules becomes narrower.
I have received many advice over the past two years where I am encouraged to keep my head low and not raise my voice so much, because it will \"do everything better\".
But that's not why I got involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the failure of the Thatcher government, which had led my classroom at the public school I attended to was literally sedentary, I have fought for better public services for those who need them the most, both as local councillor and government minister.
I have never hidden my political opinions, nor in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East may in any way have misunderstood my political views or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who presented the representative proposal on Friday, I just want to say that as our country is racing our way towards a Brexit that will harm private individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot understand and understand the desire to waste time and forces on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum - it is to those I represent, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of denunciation or political compromise will prevent me from doing what I think best protects your interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeseired Ayr rises to top
Two late attempts have changed the end result a little, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this fantastic entertainment Tennent's Premiership game.
They are now at the top of the table, and are the only undefeated of the ten.
Finally, it was as much their superior defense as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities that led the home team to lose the victory, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be satisfied.
“We have been challenged in our fights so far and are still undefeated, so I must be happy with that,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “All honor to Ayr, they were better at using the opportunities than we were.”
Grant Anderson's attempt for 14 minutes, with a target park from Frazier Climo gave Ayr the lead, but a yellow card to Scotland's captain Rory Hughes, borrowed from Warriors, let Melrose equalize the position, and Jason Baggot performed an attempt without a target park.
Climo strengthened Ayr's leadership with a penalty kick before he, just before the break, scored and the goal kick a solo attempt to change the position to 17-5 at a break.
But Melrose started second half strongly, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, with target kick from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This was a longer stay in connection with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried out on the stretch, and from the restart, Ayr’s management even increased an edgy from Stafford McDowell, with Climo’s target park.
Ayr's acting captain, Blain Macpherson, was then given a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having an extra man on the field to the fullest with an attempt by Bruce Colvine without a target park, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the home team came back strongly, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for dealing with the Climo when he didn't have the ball, MacPherson performed a touchdown at the throw behind the advancing Ayr maul.
Climo performed a goal park, as he did again almost entirely from the start, after Kyle Rowe captured David Armstrong's box kick and sent flank Gregor Henry off for the fifth attempt of the home team.
Still Game star is ready for a new career in the restaurant business
It seems that Still Game star Ford Kieran is on his way into the serving industry - it was recently discovered that he is named as the director of a restaurant company with debauchery.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays on the popular BBC program, which he writes scripts for and plays in conjunction with his long-term comedy partner, Greg Hemhill.
The duen has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is now planning life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is the director of Akvarkmorn Limited.
The actor would not comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow’s “living restaurant industry”.
\"The ocean is ours: Bolivia, a country without coastline, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors patrol a rainy-covered marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a sea blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicacas to Amazonas are decorated with the motto: “We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to regain it.\"
The entire Indian state of Bolivia has still refreshed the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody 19th-century resource conflict, and the country yearns for once again sailing on the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be greater than they have been in decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court on 1 October after five years of discussion.
\"Bolivia has drive, community spirit and peace of mind, and, of course, awaites the result with a positive attitude,\" said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ruling of the International Court of Justice on a large screen in many different places in the country, hoping that the Court of the Hague will give its ruling in favor of Bolivia's claim that Chile, after decades of sporadic negotiations, is committed to negotiating to give Bolivia its own outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president — facing a controversial re-election campaign next year — has also invested a lot in Monday’s ruling.
\"We are very close to a return to the Pacific,\" he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will hardly take Bolivia’s party and that very little would change if it had.
The UN agency, which held in the Netherlands, has no authority that allows them to give away Chilean lands, and has spurred that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
That the ruling of the International Court comes only six months after the last arguments were heard indicate that the case was \"not complicated\", according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than promoting Bolivia’s case, the last four years may have actually made things worse.
\"The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,\" Zárate said.
She believes that Morales' antagonistic rhetoric has wiped out any remaining goodwill on Chile's part.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at one point or another, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the theory that the court's decision came unusually quickly.
According to him, Monday will give Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to open up a new generation of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “put an end to 139 years of disagreement, in favor of both parties.”
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, has used the maritime situation as a political shell.
\"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific,\" he added.
“The feeling is an opportunity to see what we need to do to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never destroy its nuclear weapons if they cannot trust U.S. authorities.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to comply with the promises they made during a meeting between the two conflicting countries’ leaders in Singapore.
These comments come at the same time as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be ready to initiate the locked nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a “desired dream” that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to is a statement ending the Korean War will ever force North Korea into knees.
The U.S. authorities are skeptical of accepting the declaration without the Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Kim and Donald Trump both want a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt as to whether Pyongyang really plans to let go of an arsenal country probably sees as the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest in huge head covering, which is heading for a clothing store near you
If you want any big additions to the hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you don’t need to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a selection of distinctive, oversized headplates as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the Motel Lions on the Moteuka in Paris.
Very impractical hats have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
Valentino's most noticeable garment was an excessive beige hat decorated with a spring-like wide bra that drowned the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a wizard hat, or even an pineapple, but they are not made to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks - just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had restored lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the last cries.
One creation reminded of diving equipment, including snorkel and diving glasses, while another looked like a molten ice cream in biscuits.
And if you're looking for even bigger fashion accessories, then you're lucky.
Style experts predict that the huge hats may be heading for a clothing store near you.
The oversized hats come straight into the heels of \"La Bomba\", the straw hat with a half-metre-wide bra that has been seen on everyone and everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratakowski.
The cult brand behind the very impractical hat that dominated social media has now sent yet another great creation down the catwalk - a beach bag in straw that is almost as large as the swimsuit model carrying on it.
The orange electrofia bag, which is edged with electrophoresis and supplemented with a white leather handle, was the most eye-catching creation in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the Moteuka in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the clothing stores next summer — when the designer has had such a big impact it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are crucial to world citizens
Scotland’s Free Schools are continually exhibiting academic excellence, and this has persisted in 2018 with another one year of outstanding exam results. These are supported by individual and common success in sports, arts, music and other social measures.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (the Scottish Free School Council), have more than 30,000 students across Scotland, working hard to deliver the very best school experience to both students and parents.
Free schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational body that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and sought-after choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, his words reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, his words reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's exam results, we see that language is at the top of the table with the highest pass percentages from free schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received the exam grade A.
The data obtained from the 74 member schools of the Free School Council showed that 72 percent of students received the degree A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received A.
This illustrates that free schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a crucial skill children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as a professional choice is now valued at the same level as science, technology, engineering and mathematics at the curriculum of free schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that, for the reasons that employers stated in order to have problems with possession of a job, 17 percent could be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important to clarify young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become crucial in a globalized world.
If you have learned a second language, these lifelong skills will provide real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov study answered by more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a two-digit number of participants (15 percent) could speak.
This is why investment in language learning is now crucial for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those associated with emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland, if each school teaches different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages that are considered most valuable to Britain on the way to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what interests your child, there will always be a selection of languages to choose from in Free Schools, with teachers who are experts in this area.
Scottish Free Schools aims to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the knowledge and abilities they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today’s global business environment that language is still crucial for the country’s future, and this must be reflected in teaching.
Modern languages should actually be considered \"international communication skills\".
Free schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and excellence to Scotland’s youth.
Il faut been le faire.

LeBron will have his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost against fans who want to watch LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's opening game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes to play is still not decided.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for Lakers' six-game preseason plan.
\"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career,\" he replied.
Time of Trump's meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
The president starts a series of electoral meetings tonight Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s the first of Trump’s five scheduled public meetings over the next week, including stops in cities where he has much support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote for his elected Supreme Court candidate has been put on hold, Trump aims to obtain support for the upcoming mid-elections, since Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when voters go to the ballots in November.
When is Trump's West Virginia meeting tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trump's public meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to start at 19:00 ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's meeting in West Virginia online below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump will probably discuss the week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual assault. An expected confirmation vote is put on hold for up to one week while the FBI investigates the case.
With the main objective of all these public meetings is to support Republicans facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump has therefore said that over the next few weeks, these five public meetings aim to “incite volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters said.
“Congress control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we move towards a busy campaign season,” Reuters heard of a campaign person for Trump who didn’t want to be named.
The public meeting of the evening, which is scheduled to take place at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract supporters from \"Ohio and Pennsylvania, and is covered by the Pittsburgh press\", according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won with more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
\"It's a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a boost on the polls,\" said Simon Haeder, an expert on political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows fighting spirit to keep their faith as they enter Sunday single game
After three unilateral sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The Momentum's swinging pendulum is a fully fictional sports concept, yet something the players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
\"They led with six points and now there are four, so we'll wear it with us as a little momentum,\" said Jordan Spieth when he left the field for the day.
Europe will of course have the advantage - they lead with four points and there are 12 left to play for.
But as Spieth says, Americans feel that they have gained some wind in the sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent games from tee to green, and leads by example.
The deep celebrations grew higher as his round continued and sank to a crucial putting to raise the match to tie when he and Thomas lay two below two.
His putting, who won them the 15th match, was met with a similar shout, of the kind that shows that he still does not believe that the American team is hopeless.
“We really just have to put all the climbs to and focus on our own match,” Spieth said.
That’s all each of these players have now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have received more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are undoubtedly Ryder Cup’s great success history.
Europe's unusual but wonderful couple have four out of four and don't make a mistake.
\"Moliwood\" was the only couple to avoid a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided Bogey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the lively crowd make it clear that they are Sunday’s biggest competitors, and there are no other players the audience will also see secure a European victory as the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Prefer both at the same time, in each hole.
However, it is too early to declare Europe as the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson easily hammed up with Sergio Garcia, the morning fourballs hero, when he partnered with Alex Noren.
After one arcey and two double during the first nine holes, the Spanish and Swedish were so far behind that they did not have the nubbesian to take the lead.
On Sunday, however, there is no help.
Fourballs and Foursomes are very interesting to look at close-up because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they don’t give and how a strategy can turn in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is far ahead of the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the Team USA has the fighting spirit of some, especially in the United States, has missed.
Europe leader 10-6 at the start of the last day in the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong head start at the beginning of the Ryder Cup's last day, after completing Sunday's four-ball and foursomes matches with 10-6 leadership against the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two wins against a broken Tiger Woods, raising their score for Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bjørn's European side, who fights to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's unfortunate side in the morning's fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. gave more resistance in foursomes and won two games, but they didn’t get any of the lead.
Jim Furyk’s side must earn eight points from Sunday’s 12 single games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to get four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who together have been nicknamed \"Moliwood\" after a sensational weekend, are the only couple to get four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they co-operated seamlessly to defeat broken Woods and the American rookie Bryson Decambaau with even more reprintable 5&4.
Woods, who stayed through two games on Saturday, flashed in between, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, rested for morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in foursomes and performed a 2&1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked number one and three worldwide.
But Europe did not get everything they wanted on this warm day with light breeze southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won majors three times, set the standard for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won a tough 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Just two times in Ryder Cup history, a team has managed to pick up after a four-point headwind at the beginning of the single game, but as current holders only Furyk’s side needs to achieve a tie to keep the trophy.
But after being second best for two days, it does not seem that they will be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea will “not in any way” agree to unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthened the distrust of the United States and that the country will in no way agree to unilaterally release its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual General Assembly that North Korea has conducted “significant goodwill measures” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantle the nuclear test area and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We haven’t seen any similar response from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not, under any circumstances, unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints on Washington's opposition to a gradual nuclear disarmament, where North Korea is rewarded for gradual disarmament steps, but his statement was significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on 12 June, at the very first meeting between a sitting president of the United States and a North Korean leader, where Kim promised to work against \"atomic disarmament of the Korean Peninsula\", while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the Korean War that lasted from 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first let go of its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to reduce strict international sanctions against North Korea.
\"The U.S. insists on \"atomic disarmament first,\" raising the pressure via sanctions to achieve its goal of coercion, and even resisting the \"proclamation of the end of war\"\" according to Ri.
“The belief that sanctions can force us into our knees is a dream for people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions create further mistrust.\"
Ri did not mention the plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader stressed in front of the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months, adding: “If the other party in this disarmament case was South Korea, rather than the United States, would not have been as locked up as it is.”
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on mainland U.S. with North Korea's rockets was inevitable after \"Mr. Evil President\" Trump called Kim a \"racettman\" on a suicide mission.
After threatening to “completely destroy” by North Korea last year, Trump stood in front of the UN this year and praised Kim for being brave enough to take disarmament steps, but said that much work still remains, and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he didn’t have a time frame for this, saying that “It doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures implemented.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The sanctions of the Security Council must still be enforced severely and without exception until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to cut funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile weapons program.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that they had prospered, but only hours after accused North Korea of making “goose demands.”
North Korea committed itself in a meeting with Moon this month to lay down a missile area as well as a nuclear weapons facility if the United States did \"similar measures\".
He said Kim had said that these \"similar measures\" he wanted were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalize the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard take a course in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will help students get more sleep by dealing with the growing unculture of punging through the night with caffeine chips as fuel.
An academic found that students at the world’s best university often did not have any clue how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course, which he believes to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He started the course after he gave a lecture on the impact of sleep shortages on learning.
“After the talk, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why hasn’t anyone said this before?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and it surprised me,\" he told The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains the importance of good sleep habits in order to perform academically and sportingly, and for the general state.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and CEO of University Health Services, said that the university decided to start the course after they saw that students suffered from severe sleep shortages.
The course, which lasts for an hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a room in a dormitory, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books and hear about the effects of caffeine and light and how sporting performance is affected by lack of sleep, and how important it is with a sleep routine.
In another part, participants learn how long-term sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campuses with interactive icons makes participants think about their own daily routine.
“We are aware that this will not change students’ behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know about this, in the same way as you have the right to know about the risk of smoking,\" said Professor Czeisler.
There is still some pride in being able to poke all night, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students led to sleep shortages being an increasing problem.
Enough and good sleep should be the students’ “secret weapons” against stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said — even as a means of weight gain, as sleep shortage puts the brain in hunger mode, causing constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course. He took one of the classes to the professor last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course inspired him to work for a course available for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all the master students to take a similar study program before they are enrolled in the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students put on an alarm for when to lay down as well as for when to get up and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic displays and LED lights. This type of light can interfere with the daytime rhythm and lead to sleep difficulties.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Measure of Menga beats out Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss when Dolly Mengas goal hit Steven Gerrard's team 1-0 on Livingston.
The Ibrox side wanted to win its first victory since February's victory 4-1 on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss of 18 games as manager and left his eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
The men beat to seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers never managed to equalize.
Rangers now fall into sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to the third and is behind the Hibernian on goal difference.
There may be more trouble in the yeast for Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an item was thrown from the away audience.
Gerrard made eight replacements on the team, which swept past Ayr and into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 who scored a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been pleased with how his well-trained team defeated the opponents.
Rangers might have the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They were supposed to score only two minutes into the game when Mengas first pass sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle player missed the chance.
A long free kick by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot at the finish bar.
Rangers took control, but it seemed that their game was leaning more on hope than on faith in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have a penalty kick after a quarter, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson refused this.
Rangers only managed two shots on goal in the first place, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not have any problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tamt kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livis's opening for the 34th minute may have been against the game's course, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort.
Again, Rangers failed to handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who held his head cold when he selected Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent in the break, and the player switch gave immediate results when the winger sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get the away players to play exactly the kind of game they like, as Lithgow and Halkett caught up long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched the lead in the last half, but McGregor stood up against Jacobs before the Lithgow head from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton probably had a late demand for a penalty kick as he came into conflict with Jacobs, but again saw Thomson away.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geigereller
And now a page from the \"Sunday Morning\" calendar: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm \"Hans\" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the apparatus we know today as the geiger counter.
The Geigereller has been an important part of science since then, and also became part of popular culture via the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: \"What in the world is that?\"
Rogers: \"It's a geogerteller, it finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you touch these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms that the radioactivity of the minerals emits.\"
Evans: \"Shall say it makes noise now!\"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention he gave the name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory
Cells can now “see” a protein that is common in many cancers and then injects into the patient again.
A vaccine during the trial has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, found that the ovarian cancer she suffered from disappeared for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2, which is typical of many cancers, and then inject these cells into the patient again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland said: “The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 \"reduces growth of various cancer types\", including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method in which immune cells were taken from the patient and \"trained\" to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, wearing a MAGA hat, came with fierce defense of Trump after the SNL appearance.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was built in the studio on Saturday Night Live after a famous appearance where he taught U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for election in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he stretched out against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
“It happens so often that I talk to a white person, and then he says, “How can you like Trump, he’s racist?”
If I was afraid of racism, I would have moved from the United States a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judicial Committee for the allegations of sexual abuse that Christine Blasey Ford promoted.
Although not broadcast, the recording of West was uploaded into social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock wanted to ridicule West by posting the recording.
West also complained to the public that he heard it in the back room about the choice of head covering.
\"They bullied me.
They said, \"Don't go out there with that hat on.\"
They bullied me!
And then they said I don't know what the reality is,\" he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: \"Do you want me to know what the reality is?\" he said, saying that he would \"take on me the Superman coat, because then nobody can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try love.\"
His comments were arched at least twice, and the employees who worked at the SNL so embarrassedly reported Variety, where a staff member said: \"The entire studio was put to death.\"
West was brought in as the last small substitute for singer Ariana Grande, when her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he performed the song \"I Love It\" dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West was supported by the head of the Conservative group TPUSA, Chandice Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of our bravest: TAKK FOR YOU TO STAY IMOT MASSES.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just \"who he is and it's absolutely amazing\".
“But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothes or supporting his “art”) which I mean cultivate and spit out ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
We are, too,\" she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name. He said that from now on he was \"the creature formally known as Kanye West\".
He is not the first artist to change his name and now follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper fellow Snoop Dogg has had the name Snoop Lion. Then, of course, there is late music legend Prince, who changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was previously known as Prince.
The aim of attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
Aimed are expected to be prepared for the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The aim will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington takes out against “Givable Masculinity”
Kit Harington is known from the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone out and criticized the stereotype of the macho hero and says such roles on film often make young men think they have to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said something has gone wrong and wondered how to attack the problem of “toxic masculinity” in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones colleague Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that he was very interested in the theme.
“It worries me a lot at the moment, where did the masculinity go?” he said.
“How have we raised men in view of the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that TV may have parts of the blame for the increase in “toxic masculinity” because of the strong masculine roles.
He said, “What is born and what is born?
What is communicated on TV and on the street, what makes young boys feel that they have to grow this very side by being a man?
I think it’s one of the really big questions of our time — how can we change it?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also admits that he will not make any precursors or successors of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he is \"completed with battlefields and horses\".
From November, Kit will play the lead role in a remake of Sam Shepard True West. This is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife during the recordings, so something good came out of it — my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygrite, in which Kit's character Jon Snow is in love, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, says health representative.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are transmitted via sex, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China by infection through blood transfusion.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way is now closer to zero, Chinese health care professionals said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, for years, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men, eventually marry women.
Much of the disease is caused by insufficient protection by sex in these conditions.
Since 2003, China’s authorities have pledged public access to HIV medicine as part of an action to address the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects that co-working leaked data on Republican Senators, snores of \"hazard lies\" and \"conspiracy theories\"
Member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, rejected Saturday charges that members of her staff had posted the personal information to three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lawmakers.
The Democrat of Los Angeles insured by the allegations was made by \"ultraconservative\" commentators and web pages.
“Lows, lies, and more reprehensible lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information included alleged home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate on the assault charges against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was tracked to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of Waters staff, according to Hill.
\"This baseless charge is completely incorrect and a regular lie,\" the Waters continued.
\"The members of my staff - who have received their identities, personal information and security compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false charges - had absolutely no responsibility for the leak of this information.
This unwarranted accusation is completely incorrect and a regular lie.”
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, among others by former White House Press Secretary, Ari Fleischer.
\"This denial is aggressive,\" Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she does not have the right temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be aggressive.
You don't have to go into defense.
You must not doubt the motives of the prosecutor.
They must act calmly and understandingly.”
Fleischer compared Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing aggressive during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate working to remove Waters in the mid-elections, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
\"Great, if it's true,\" tweeted him.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified “relevant authorities and police about these false charges.”
\"We will ensure that the perpetrators are revealed,\" she continued \"and that they are held accountable for all acts that are destructive and dangerous to each of my staff\".
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again - blood poor Rowan Atkinson in spy parody
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit significances in all new films with a British look and it seems to be relevant for this revival of parodifranchius Johnny English action comedy - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and re-established in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will Sarcastic self-sattire on how obviously hopeless we are become the nation’s new export product?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his bulging eyes and rubber face has been renewed his license to root it to for the second time - his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comic figure intended for territories with non-English-speaking cinema audience.
He is of course the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a déj Mr Bean and a serving of the guy who contributes one single note in the music feature with firecar themes during the opening ceremony at the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also originally based on the role played by Atkinson in the long-forgotten television ads for Barclaycard; the traveler and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
There's a great moment in the latest Johnny English journey.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades narrowed his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy comes to its right, but humor feels quite bloodless and strangely superfluous, especially now that the \"serious\" brands such as 007 and Mission Imposible willingly away have feature of comedy.
The humor seems to be more focused on children than adults, and for me, Johnny English's fades are not as inventive and pointed as the silent film loops in Mr Bean.
The current premise is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the United Kingdom's super secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, to the fear of the watchful agent - a sad little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a Prime Minister, a pompous and downbeat figure that is already undergoing a complete crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing a very good job with this like-Terea-May role, but the script does not give her much to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every single active spy has been revealed, she must bring in some among the retired.
And that means the clogged Johnny English, who now works as a teacher on a snobbed establishment, but provides unofficial instruction in secret intelligence. There are some polite sequences here, when English offers a rock academy for spy activity.
English is snatched back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with his old, plagued helps Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, splicing with a submarine commander, a hysterical upper-class lady role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin style to mess everything up for the queen are back, where they confront with Olga Kurylenko fantastic femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is seduced by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's cyber problems: the lukewarm Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their journey with dangerous side leaps: disguised as waiters set them on fire at a flashing French restaurant. They create chaos while hiding aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English triggers the pure anarchy as he tries to use a VR headset to make himself known in Volta's house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but even so loving and noisy there are so many memories of child television with the whole thing.
Pretty mediocre, all of it.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets to use his talent?
Labour denies that they are drawing up plans to let the British work four-day week, but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyns Labor Party will consider a radical plan that will give the British four-day work week - but get paid for five.
The party apparently wants business leaders to spend savings on the revolution with artificial intelligence by giving employees an extra day of the week.
This will mean that employees will receive a three-day weekend while receiving the same salary.
Sources say that the idea fits into the party’s economic agenda and plans to move the country in favor of employees.
The unions support the transition to four-day week so that employees can also enjoy the benefits of the new economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It will not happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition that fits the party’s desire to allow the pendulum to swing to the benefit of workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. Green Party co-operative four-day week during the campaign before the 2017 parliamentary election.
However, the idea is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day week is not the party’s policy and is not considered by the party.”
Labour Financial Policy spokesman John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from \"intentionless directors\" and \"profits\" of public service providers.
The shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies are at risk of not regaining the entire stock because a Labour government can make “deduction” based on perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in the corporate boards and set up employee funds to transfer 10% of the equity of companies in the private sector to the employees, which may receive an annual dividend of £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell \"60 Minutes - about the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh can make them change their mind
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the agency's findings may cause some Republican senators to change their views.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked in-60 Minutes — Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
\"I mean, of course,\" said Kennedy.
“I said at the beginning of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Judge Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked, “Did you?”
He was determined, inclined, unequivocal\".
Graham's voice, however, seems to be cut in stone.
“I’ve decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and it had to be an interesting finding,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it energetically,” Graham added and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people she mentioned couldn’t confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t think anything new will change it.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it helped fight poverty?
This Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an impressive list of stars to perform and an equally impressive mission; eradicating the world’s poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, which is now in its seventh year, will cause thousands of people to stream to the great lawn in Central Park, not only to experience sizes such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also increase awareness of the event's real goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to combat poverty by making more people work actively against poverty.
To get free tickets to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks, or \"actions\", such as volunteer work, send email messages to a world leader, take a phone or in other meaningful ways to raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when it is now only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to get people to fight for changes, or just another case of so-called “clicktivism” - that people feel they contribute great by signing a signature campaign online or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, they have registered more than 19 million “actions” from supporters, with a wealth of different goals.
They say that these actions have contributed to making world leaders declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group could refer to 390 engagements and announcements as a result of their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funding so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main concerns are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and entrepreneurs based in the UK who are going to \"help children exploit their full potential\", and agreed to give Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate misnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 Tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice with malnutrition a footnote in history,” the ambassador for Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition measures.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, “What makes you think that we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the important civil rights and anti-apartred movements before us, we will succeed because we stand stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists performing at this year's events in New York, which will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use the Navy as \"blocked\" to prevent Russian energy exports - the Interior Minister
Washington can \"if necessary\" resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy reaching the markets, including in the Middle East, revealed the United States Interior Minister, Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially when they operate at the invitation of the legal government — is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets.
\"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flank of Europe,\" he said.
And according to the spokesperson, there are always ways and means to deal with this.
\"The United States, through the Navy, has the opportunity to make sure the seaways are open and, if necessary, block to ensure that energy does not reach the market,\" he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that profiles itself as the \"voice of energy consumers\" in the United States.
He compared Washington's ways of interacting with Russia and Iran, and noted that they were far on their way.
\"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel,\" he said and referred to Russia as \"one trick pony\" with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements came after the Trump administration has been on a round trip to strengthen the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe. They want to replace Russia, the far cheapest option for European consumers.
Therefore, employees in the Trump administration, including the President himself, attempted to persuade Germany to withdraw from the \"inpassible\" project The North European gas pipeline 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the \"captive\" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North European gas pipeline worth $11 billion, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington’s ferocious opposition to the project is motivated only for economic reasons and is an example of unfavorable competition.
“I think we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has faced opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitments in the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, BDI, has asked the United States to stay away from EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
\"I have major problems with third countries that interfere with our energy supply,\" said Dieter Kempf, the leader of BDI after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will \"think seriously\" on her 2020 presidential candidate, Senator of Massachusetts said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would \"think seriously\" if she wanted to run for president after the mid-term elections.
During a vote in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would run.
“It’s time for women to get to Washington and fix the fragile government, and it includes a woman at the top,” she said.
“After 6 November, I will think seriously about whether to run for president.”
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the election meeting and said that he \"conducted the country in the wrong direction\".
“I’m worried about what Donald Trump is doing with democracy,” she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course, we need an FBI investigation before vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not think she should run in 2020.
58% of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the Senator should not run, according to a poll by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidacy.
The poll showed higher support for former Governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidacy and 48% was against it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially by January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin points out Track Palins PTSD during Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after serving in Sept.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic assault on Monday night
“What my son goes through, what he goes through after returning home, I have in common with other families who experience the consequences of PTSD and some of our vulnerabilities soldiers carry,” she told the public at a election event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest “the elephant in space” and said of his son and other war veterans: “They come home a little different, they come home hard, they come home and wonder if this is the respect for what their soldiers and flyers and all other members of the military have contributed to the country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence on a woman, clustering with a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police.
18 states and D.C. support the testing of new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal test of a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang or home violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. provided a orientation from the amicus curiae (friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, reported NBC News.
The entire name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union announced in August against the federal police has not been published.
She claimed that her partner \"and his violent gang member sons\" abused her, but government officials in the United States rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The State Attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations that have pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a decision in 2014 by the Court of Appeal for immigrants who granted undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Karl Racine of the District of Columbia said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “regards from many decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Food law requires all asylum requirements to be determined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a prohibition is contrary to that principle,” said the Amicus Curiae.
Lawyers further argued in the orientation that policies that refused immigration harm the U.S. economy and say that they are highly likely to become entrepreneurs and \"help with the necessary labor\" -
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer give asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
\"Asyl is available to those who leave the home country due to persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political view,\" Sessions said in the June 11 announcement.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all problems — even all serious problems — that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue in Palu - deaths double in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
\"It was very tense,\" said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforts her fevery son at an evacuation center in the merged town of Palu.
“All the time, we see ambulances getting dead.
Clean water is in short supply\".
One could see residents who came to destroyed homes and eased through water-damaged assets in an effort to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were damaged in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were filled.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, sit outside Palus military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing severe aftershock.
He gets tears in his eyes when he recounts how it felt when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves in safety.
I was hugged by the wall that collapsed, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that the family was in the city to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife calling for help, and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they’re safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of \"tracing\" with \"propaganda ads\"
A week after a public Chinese newspaper driving a four-page ad in an American newspaper that charmed the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the Annex China Daily paid to move into the Des Moines Register — the most-selling Iowa newspaper — after accusing China of attempting to interfere with U.S. Congressional elections on November 6, an accusation China rejects.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to influence the election in the United States marked a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China, said U.S. officials, according to Reuters.
It is, of course, normal for foreign authorities to use ads to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has led to rounds of new customs rates on each other’s imports.
China's criminal tribunal early in the trade war would hit export companies in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, reports Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime Governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reading post in the Des Moines Register of Sunday: “China now steps up the harassment by driving propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities utilize the freedom of speech and the open press we enjoy in America to insert a paid ad in Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“As a contrast — by the aviskiosken on the street here in Beijing, you don’t find many dissenting opinions and may not experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese around China’s problematic economic course, given that the media is under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added: “One of China’s largest newspapers declined the offer to publish” his article, although he did not inform which newspaper it was.
Republicans scare away female voters before the mid-choice with the Kavanaugh façade, warn analysts
As many top politicians among the Republicans support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has received several allegations of sexual abuse directed against him, analysts warn that they will have a counter-reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming local elections.
The feelings around this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already given signs that they want to proceed with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn,\" stated Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse Universitys Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s proposal for an FBI investigation in the last second will be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget yesterday’s events — they will not forget it tomorrow and not November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
Friday morning, protesters sang \"November is Coming!\" while demonstrating in the ranks of the Senate when Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
\"Democracy enthusiasm and motivation will explode,\" said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, to the news page.
“People say it’s already been high, it’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among female insecure voters in the suburbs and younger voters between 18 and 29 years of age, who often do not vote even if they dislike the president.”
Even before Ford's public testimony that detailed descriptions of the allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts believed that it would be a counter-reaction if Republicans forced through the appointment.
“This has become a happy root of the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the RNC (Republican National Committee), early last week, NBC News.
\"It's not just about the committee's vote or final approval or whether Kavanaugh is being put in place - it's also about the way Republicans have handled this and how they've treated her,\" said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that promotes the election of Democratic candidates, to the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided over who to believe in in the wake of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a small majority in favor of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents were completely or fairly convinced of Ford's testimony, while 35% said they were entirely or fairly convinced of Kavanaugh's presentation.
In addition, 38% said they were quite or completely convinced that Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After the action of Flake, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh in a drunk state assaulted her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed his genitals to her while at a party during the study period at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web's author plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the author of the World Wide Web, launches a start-up to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is a company that builds on Berners-Lees’ open source platform Solid.
At Solid, users can choose where their data should be stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose is \"world domination\".
\"We have to do it now,\" he said about the start-up.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own \"personal data storage online\" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, work lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique with the online personal data storage is that it is up to the user who should have access to that kind of information.
The company calls it \"personal authority through data\".
The idea behind Inrupt is according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, that the company should provide resources, process and relevant skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers on contract to work with the project and a bunch of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team do not talk to \"Facebook and Google that they should introduce something completely new or not, which will make their business models completely re-calted overnight.
“We don’t ask for your permission.”

Bernard Vann: Celebrating Victoria Kors receiver from World War I
The only priest in the English church to be awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded the honour on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he was awarded the highest British military award.
A memorial stone was uncovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was a “flot symbolism” in that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after the grandfather’s award-winning feat.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, \"through very thick fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns\".
Later he crashed towards the line of fire and led the line “with great courage” forward before storming a field gun himself and beating out three of the departments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - only a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said the grandfather's actions were \"something I knew I could never live up to, but something that makes me humble.\"
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Corps Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said he “feel very honored to play a role in the parade,” adding: “The bravery of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people.”
MMA followers were up all night to watch the martial arts program Bellator 206, instead they got the Peppa pig
Imagine that you’ve stayed awake all night to see the packed Bellator 206, just to discover that you’re not seeing the main game.
The San Jose participant managed through 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown directly through the night of the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the viewers of the United Kingdom were sitting in need when the picture suddenly showed Peppa pig.
Some were less impressed after staying awake until early morning to watch the game.
A follower described on Twitter the transition to the children's program as \"a kind of sick joke\".
\"It's government regulation that it's not appropriate to send such programs at 6:00 a.m., so they had to switch to children's programs,\" said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president for marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
\"Peppa pig, yes!\".
Bellator's CEO, Scott Coker, said they will work on the transmission plan to include viewers in Great Britain in the future.
“I think we can figure it out with a view to the re-fight,” Coker said.
“But it’s at six a.m. on Sunday there, and we won’t be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe in - when we turned over, there were many messages going back and forth, and they were not just of the friendly sort.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But that's not what it was, it was an authority thing.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will reduce from six to five games, which we usually send, and we tried to stretch far for the followers, but tipped over.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt less worthy of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of indecentness towards everyone because of his sexuality - but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn’t until he realized that “he wasn’t like others.”
In the first program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for the gay rights to give others \"hope\".
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The usual programme manager for the traditional program, Kirsty Young, should be gone a few months due to illness.
Daley was a little lost on the first broadcast of Laverna and said he felt \"less worth\" than everyone else he grew up with because \"it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls\".
He said: “To this day, there are these feelings of being inferior and different that have been the real motivation and have me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is a two-time bronze winner in the Olympics and has become a high-profile LGBT ambassador. He used his participation at this year's Commonwealth in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he stands out because he feels lucky that can live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others \"hope\".
The three-time world champion said that he fell in love with a man - filmmaker Dustin Lance Black of the United States, whom he met in 2013 - \"surprising me\".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
\"When you go through so much at such a young age\" — he attended his first Olympics when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later — he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his whole perspective had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, everything was going to matter that I just had to win a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals in the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie\".
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after receiving the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had got tickets to London in 2012 - since he wanted to sit on the first row.
\"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't live long enough to sit in the first row,\" he said.
\"I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn't invincible,\" he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life — to plunge in front of a home audience during the Olympics, the best feeling ever,” he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Proud of Heather Small - which meant a lot to him in the run before the Olympics and still gives him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs attend BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Formsvake Mickelson taken out to the Ryder Cup Golf Tournament Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to get in shape if it isn't to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennia for an impressive 12th time, was put on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk before Saturday's four-ball and foursome games.
Instead of being in the center of events, which he had so often been for the United States, the five-time major winner divides the day between being a cheerleader and working with his game on the rank in hopes to fix it as a scorer.
The 48-year-old never had the best turn, even on the top of his career and is not in the perfect form of the tight Le Golf National course, where the long rough area constantly punishs lost battles.
And if the course itself is not scary enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, himself British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined the beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 single games, get a successful start, Mickelson's game can prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expresses confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
\"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on his back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready the next day,\" Furyk said.
\"He has great confidence.
He is a “Hall of Famer” and has contributed so much to these teams before, and this week.
I guess I didn't see him play two games.
I saw more, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Fallo's record for most played Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never reached his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven ties, but Furyk said his participation added some intangible values to the team.
\"He's funny, sarcastic, witty and likes to fuck with others. He's a great guy to have in the team room,\" he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun trying against him this week as well, and it was fun to see.
He gives much more than just the game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjørn knows that his great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a significant lead at the entrance to the last day single game in the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where one side led by the Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but curated the victory with the least margin possible, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only barely,” Bjørn, photographed after seeing Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday leading 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone else on the team that this is not over.
You'll give it all tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus is.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are very aware of what is on the other side - the best golfers in the world.”
Bjørn is very pleased with how his players have managed on the tough golf course and adds: “I couldn’t do better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow, it is the individual performances that stand in the center, and it is something completely different.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you’re out there alone, your performances as a golfer are tested to the full.
It’s the message you need to convey to the players, that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave the partner, and he must also go out and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjørn, opponent Jim Furykk will try to make his players perform better individually than they did as partners. The exception is Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the major revolutions last day, joining the Brookline winning team before finishing up as a loser when Europe performed the \"mirakel at Medinah\".
I remember each condemned word of it,\" he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team captain, had bequeathed his players at the entrance to the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to get a good start, like the one we experienced at Brookline, which we saw at Medinah.
When the momentum starts to go in one direction, it puts a big pressure on the middle games.
We arrange our setup then and send out the people the way we feel. You know, we're trying to create something magical tomorrow.\"
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the game and challenging Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the top half of the player series.
\"I'm betting on this group of men in that order because I think it's going all the way,\" Bjørn said of his choices of single players.
Germany’s new warship delayed once again
The German Navy's latest frigate should have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the Cold War days, but it will not happen until the early next year due to failing systems and galloping costs, local media reported.
The completion of the \"Rheinland-Pfalz\", the drivership of the brand new frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesperson.
The vessel would have been handed over to the Navy in 2014, but the major problems after delivery pursued the ambitious project.
The four boats in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class commissioned all the way back in 2007, will replace the old frigates in the Bremen class.
It is agreed that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it would be possible to use the latest frigates for up to two years away from the home port.
Still delays mean, however, that the advanced warships - they were told to give Germany strength on the sea - will already be outdated before being served, reports Die Zeit.
The fateful F125 freight created headlines last year, when German marines officially refused to put the vessel into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the return, but the German media mentioned a number of important \"software and hardware defects\" that made the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important since boats in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class should be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older frigates in the Bremen class.
It was also revealed that the ship has a huge obesity, which reduces performance and limits the marines' ability to make upgrades in the future.
It is estimated that the 770-ton tongue Rhineland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price tag on the entire project, including training the crew, has also begun to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion - from the original €2.2 billion.
The problems surrounding the new frigates are particularly significant in light of fresh warnings that Germany’s marine force shrinks.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German government's Defense Committee, confirmed that the navy is actually \"gos out of usable ships\".
The official said the problem has escalated over time because old ships had been deployed, but no new vessels were coming.
He regrets that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the Navy.
National Trust theft on the secret life of the bats
New research carried out by a land estate in the Scottish Highlands will reveal how bats use the landscape in the pursuit of food.
It is hope that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help design future conservation measures.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and dwarf bats as well as brown-lancing and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Experts’ sound analyses of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bats and what species do what.
Then a habitat map and a report will be prepared to create a detailed landscape image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will be included in the decision on the measures to be introduced, such as planting pastures and how to best preserve the forest for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and construction work that affects breeding sites and cutting habitats.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, the same with fly paper and certain chemically treated building materials as well as attacks from head taxes.
In fact, bats are not blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, they have more use for the ears than the eyes when it comes to capturing prey.
They use advanced echolocation to find insects and obstacles on the road when flying.
NTS, responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten skilled experts who regularly conduct surveys, mapping breeding sites, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization has also established Scotland's first and only own bat reserve at the Three Land Real Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bats.
David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
“Here on Three we have a perfect area for bats,” he said.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.”
He emphasizes the importance of mapping the bats before maintaining on a property since the accidental destruction of a single breeding site can kill up to 400 females and young people, and perhaps excavate an entire local population.
The bat is protected, and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disrupt them or destroy their breeding grounds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish co-worker for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help in the work.
She says: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species, we simply don’t know how the populations are doing.”
Ronaldo rejects the rape charges while lawyers will sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape charges against him as “false news” and says that people “want fame” by using his name.
His lawyers will sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is accused of paying her $375,000 in the aftermath of keeping close to the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
When he spoke on a direct video on Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after the charges were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo rejected the charges as \"false news\".
\"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news,” said five times the winner of the gold ball into the camera.
“They want fame by using my name.
It's normal.
They want fame by giving my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm fine,\" the footballer adds a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel because of the allegations, which they have called \"an unacceptable representation of suspicions in the private sphere,\" Reuters said.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the footballer will require compensation for “democracy damage to an extent equivalent to the severity of the breach, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of privacy in recent years.”
The alleged event occurred in June 2009 at a suite in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents presented to the Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was \"99% a good man\" who was failed by the \"one percent\".
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were taken from hospital, but later they settled outside the court because she was \"lived for revenge\" and was also worried about being \"publicly suspended\".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to put the settlement aside because she is still traumatized after the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of switching from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged abuse, and this summer moved to Italian Juventus on a contract worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: United Kingdom \"will mourn forever\" to lose car manufacturers
Britain \"will mourn forever\" if they lose the status of world leader in car production after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was \"concerning\" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without agreement, they would stop production temporarily at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the consequences of delayed border crossing at any Brexit without agreement could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the EU.
\"If Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will, in my view, see that production at our factory stops,\" said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO at Burnaston.
Other British producers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without agreement as to how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says they will close the Mini Factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is about what car manufacturers say is supply chain risks at any Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s production line is operated on the basis of “reservation as needed”, and it arrives every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it may stay at the border, as the industry says may lead to delays and lack of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day stock at the Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production will stop.
Clark said that Theresa May's Brexit plan for further connection with the EU is \"presist arranged to avoid such controls at the border\".
“We need to have an agreement. We want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy success at the moment, but to seize this opportunity,” he said on the BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
“The company, not only from Toyota but also other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production will be stopped, but warned that increasing costs in the long term will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually lead to loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade union leader at the factory, said that members are becoming increasingly concerned: “My experience suggests that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back.”
A government spokesperson said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again,” the White House said.
Donald Trump’s fateful meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein may be “seen another week” while the fight around Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special advisor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian involvement in the election, connections between Trump assistants and Russia, as well as possible obstacles to court enforcement on the part of the President.
The question of Trump will dismiss the Deputy Justice Minister or not, thus threatening Mueller’s independence, has been exasperating for many months during the speculations in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the opportunity to address the talks with Trump and try to remove the president with the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that he was resigning voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was at the time in the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he would \"preferably let go\" to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was subjected to avoid it clashing with the Senates Judiciary Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who has accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation in one week regarding charges against Kavanaugh, which further subjected a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
Asking questions about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “A date for the meeting was not set; it could be this week, but I realized it could be a week’s delay because of all that happens to the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I’m always concerned about keeping the press up to date.”
Some journalists will dispute that claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Program host Chris Wallace asked about the cause.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to disapproval of TV reporters’ “self-worth,” although she added: “I don’t disagree with their self-interest.”
Then she suggested that the contact between Trump and the press will be more frequent.
\"The front page makes more questions than any previous presidents,\" she said and added without providing evidence: \"We've looked at the numbers\"
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but \"If the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States questions directly, it will certainly be better than talking to me.
We’re trying to make it happen often, and you’ve seen that we’ve done it often over the past few weeks, and it’s going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open events or press conferences when visiting important people.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible cause, when he was doing a solo race and at times had a strange behavior in front of a lot of reporters.
Health secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland regarding Brexit concerns
The Secretary of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS (State Health Service) to express the country’s gratitude and a desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish Member of Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain had to leave the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to covering the costs of applying for a residence and work permit for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “Complaints between the UK and the EU have been conducted over the summer and are expected to land on a solution for the fall.
But the British government has also stepped up the preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I understand that this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
I will therefore repeat now how much I appreciate the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and outside, add valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare service for the benefit of patients and local communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we hope you will stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes urgent surgery after head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, underwent urgent surgery after having suffered a head injury during Saturday’s 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ reported in Tennessee newspaper.
Tennessee State's head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the first half was over.
\"He came out on the sideline and just collapsed there,\" Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him back for further investigation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had been operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that \"there is no information on the type/recovery of the injury yet\" and Tennessee State attempts to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transition from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before finishing the game, giving a total of 18 tackles for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. According to new Tory plans, the extra money will be spent to help the homeless
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's plan to attract young voters
The document tax increase will be collected from those who do not pay taxes in the UK
Experts in the Ministry of Finance expect it to increase up to 120 million pounds a year - to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the UK - and the extra money will be spent to help the homeless.
The measure will be considered an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's plan to attract young voters with the promise to offer affordable housing and frame high income groups.
The document fee increase will be imposed on persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money will strengthen the government's action to alleviate the situation of the homeless.
The surplus, which comes in addition to the current document fee, including the higher tariff introduced two years ago on the second house and residential purchases for rentals, can be as much as 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects that the measure will bring up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by non-residents in the UK, which drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get their feet inside the housing market.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities because of the many foreign buyers who mostly live outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson made suggestions for a reduction in document fees to help more young people own their own homes.
He accused large construction companies of keeping housing prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded that Theresa May reject quotas on affordable housing to resolve Britain's \"shamble housing policies\".
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a wide range of proposed housing reforms, including rental controls and an end to unsolicited evictions.
He also wants to give the council more power to build new homes.
May said: “I said last year that I would acquire my time as Prime Minister to restore the British dream — that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be as easy for people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign-based companies, to buy homes as it is for hard-working British citizens.
For many people, the dream of owning your own home has become too far away, and the unworthy situation for the homeless persists\".
Jack Ross: \"My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland\"
Sunderland’s boss, Jack Ross, says his “final goal” is to become Scotland’s manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is looking forward to the challenge of reviving the club in the northeast, which currently holds third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
“I got a B cap and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sports Sound.
\"But I was often with my father and saw Scotland on Hampden as a child, and there's always something that pulls me back.
But that opportunity would only come if I succeed in the club management.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic chief says he was not anxious to follow such established names in the large club, and has previously declined approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
\"Success for me at the moment will be measured on whether I can get the club back in the Premier League\".
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, they undoubtedly belong to the Premier League,\" he said.
It’s not a simple task to get it there, but I’ll probably only consider myself to have succeeded here if I get the club back there.”
Ross has only been in charge for three years, after a period as assistant head at Dumbarton and a 15-month short appearance in Hearts' coach staff.
Then he helped Alloa to get back from descent to third division and helped St Mirren from the edge of the downfall to win the championship of the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during the play career of Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
\"It was probably a real intersection,\" he recalls when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
“I really thought that leadership was the right thing for me, more right than playing.
It sounds strange since I did well, made me a reasonable income from it and experienced some fine highlights.
But football playing can be tough.
There are many things you need to get through on a weekly basis.
I go forward with it in terms of stress and pressure at work, but the management feels perfectly right for me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do. It feels like the most comfortable I’ve known throughout my adult life.”

Perfect time for a half-liter is 17.30 on Saturdays, showing survey
The heat wave of summer has strengthened the income of the UK’s hard-pressed pubs, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced a sales increase of 2.7% in July - while the income for restaurants fell 4.8%, the figures show.
Peter Martin, a corporate consultant CGA, who summarized the figures, said: “Continued sunshine and England’s unexpected long participation in the World Cup, July followed a similar pattern as the previous month of June, when the pubs rose 2.8%, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurant turnover in June was only worse in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had the very best result, but an increase that was stronger like that of restaurants went down.
Pubs with food served were also difficult with the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for the rapaurant drivers.
It seemed that people just wanted to drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, sales increased by 6.6% that month, with food serving decreased 3%\".
Paul Newman, an analyst from the hotel and restaurant industry RSM, stated: “These results follow the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and large sports and social events are still the most important factors when it comes to trading on the outside market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups are still having difficulty, and a sales drop of 4.8% year-on-year will be particularly painful on top of running cost pressures.
The long, warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food serving businesses, and the time will show if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide a long-sleeved breathing room.”
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in rollouts of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, industry sales controller for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, collects and analyzes the results from 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of £9 billion, and is the established industry standard.
One in five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One in five children - some are just 11 years old - has secret accounts on social media that they hide from parents and teachers, showing survey
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed pages with \"fake Insta\".
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is shared.
20% of students said they have a “head account” as they show their parents.
One in five children - some are just 11 years old - creates accounts on social media that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed a rapid growth in fake Insta accounts - a reference to photo sharing pages on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the sharing of sexual content.
20% of students said they had an innocent “head account” which they refer to their parents, while having other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to “rapture me.”
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Conference (HMC) for private schools revealed that 40% of 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s scary that so many youths are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be \"the voice of the athletes\" in Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected the board of Scottish Athletics and has a non-executive role in the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athletic athlete, and Chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those who lead the sport to gain insight into her extensive experience on international nviå over the past ten years.
\"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and worldwide athletics environment, and we are sure that athletic athletes in Scotland will enjoy bringing her into the board,\" Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I am excited to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I have a lot to contribute to guide sports in Scotland.”
The American won 200 and 400 metres during the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and has a total of four Olympic golds. She is now a regular BBC expert, and after she suffered a transient ischemic attack she failed to walk.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I want to be recovered and to what extent.
It’s been hard work, but I’m fine again and have learned to walk again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!\"
Breast pump ad that compares mothers to cows splits opinion online
A breast pump company has divided the opinion online with an ad that compares nursing mothers to cows that get milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be \"the world's first soundless breast pump that is worn closely against the body\", Elvie, the technology-based company for consumer goods, a fresh and flirting, music video-inspired ad to show freedom the new pump provides active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of high and cow to a song with the following text: “Yes, I’m milking myself, but you can’t see any tail” and “In the case you didn’t understand it, this isn’t law, it’s my tits.”
The choir continues: “Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my bowls.”
However, the advertisement published on the company’s Facebook page has created a storm on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, many say the quadratic “gross” in the dairy industry.
\"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and feed to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth,\" one wrote.
Elvie breast pump gets nice space in a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Appreciably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But, hey, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers allowed to keep their babies?\"
Another added: \"For a failed ad\".
Others defend the ad. A woman admitted that she thinks the song is \"unbelievably funny\".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would like to have one if I was still breast-feeding.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product,\" one wrote.
Another commented: “This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who pump (often in the workplace or toilets) and feel like ‘kuer’.
This is not an ad that hails or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump, say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and gets nice space in a nursing bra so that women have the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD of Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and milk cow, we wanted to put search light on breast pumping and all the challenges, while in an entertaining and recognizable way showing the incredible feeling of freedom the new pump provides.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a two-child mother appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Yakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp at the Texas border secretly
The number of detained migrant children has taken place although the monthly border crossing has remained relatively stable, partly because hard rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with supporters.
Traditionally, most supporters themselves have been undocumented immigrants, and have been afraid to destroy their own chances of staying in the country by coming forward and claiming a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults in the household had to provide fingerprints and that the data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people seeking to be a supporter of single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrested did not have a previous criminal record.
Almost 80% of the people who are either supporters or members of the household of supporters are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminals.
So we continue to pursue these people,\" Albence said.
The officers try to deal with the children faster and introduce new rules that indicate that some of them must face the court within one month of being arrested, and not 60 days that were the previous standard, according to reception workers.
Many will be presented via videoconferencing rather than face up personally to lead their case of residence permit for an immigration judge.
Those who are considered unqualified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in custody, the greater the risk of anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to reception workers and reports that have appeared in the session in recent months.
Lawyers said that these concerns have grown at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where children who struggle more easily are overlooked due to the size of the plant.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without having enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can reinforce traumas that many already struggle with.
Syria calls on the United States, French and Turkish “occupancy powers” to withdraw immediately
In a speech in the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, although the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces stayed illegally on Syrian soil under the cover of fighting terrorism and \"will be treated accordingly\".
\"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,\" he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the \"war on terror is over\" in Syria, where more than 36,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have fled.
He said Damascus will continue to \"conduct this holy struggle until we have cleared all Syrian territories\" for both terrorist groups and \"all foreign presence\".
The United States has around 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for the training and counseling of Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
When it comes to refugees, Moualem said that conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused \"certain Western countries\" of \"stressing irrational escapes\" that make the refugees stay away.
\"We have approached the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,\" he said.
“They are policing what is really a purely humanitarian situation.”
The United States and the EU have warned that support for the reconstruction of Syria will not come before a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the rebel’s last major defence position at Idlib has created an opportunity to push for political talks.
The Russian/Turkish agreement averted a large scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces against the province where there are three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had \"clear deadlines\" and expressed hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including warriors from Al-Qaeda affiliated Nusra Front, who \"will be wiped out\".
U.N. broadcaster Staffan de Mistura hopes he will soon be able to call for the first meetings of a new committee consisting of state and opposition members to draw up a post-war Constitution for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem made arrangements for the Syrian authorities to participate in the committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited to \"the review of the articles of the present Constitution\" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win another period
After that logic, Trump would have won re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope for, impeachment and scandal, an end to presidency before that time.
In what would undoubtedly become \"the most dramatic conclusion to a presidency ever!\"
At the moment, there are no signs of seretity.
Since 2014, viewer numbers for best shipping time have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best transmission time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" has peaked the cable viewer numbers with as many as 3.5 million viewers in the evenings with big news issues.
\"This is a fire that people are attracted to because we don't understand anything,\" said Neal Baer, head of the ABC drama \"Designed Survivor\", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a renowned comedy creator and author of \"Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club\", has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him to vote for Trump.
Why did she ask?
He said, \"Because he makes me laugh.\"
It is an entertainment value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the actions that take place in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Release is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you stretch far to be an enlightened human being when you sit for six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of \"deep-deep-deep-deep\" for the book \"Fear\", Paul Manafort's leather jacket with the ostrich worth of $15,000 (\"a garment mirrored with hybrids\",\" said the Washington Post) and the consequences of Grandy Daniels' colorful descriptions of Trumps, uh ..., anatomy.
I don’t want to look at Super Mario the same way.
\"Some of what he does that makes it look like a reality show, is that he gives you something every night,\" said Brent Montgomery, the daily leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of \"Pawn Stars\", about Trump's varying cast and daily twist on the plot (crowded with NFL, shameless Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss one episode, otherwise you'll be hanging after.
When I met Fleiss this week, there were 27°C and sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he caged in and looked at MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not break free, not when Brett Kavanaugh is going to meet the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in the United States is at stake.
\"I remember when we made all the crazy programs in the old days and people said this is the end of Western civilization,\" Fleiss said.
\"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.\"

Money from outside flows into the regular mid-ranges of the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th district experiences a stream of money after a conversion of a congressional district that ended with two sitting representatives fighting for the same seat.
This recently re-emerged suburban district of Pittsburgh is running with Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a supple election last spring.
Lamb opposes another sitting representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Old Pennsylvania, which greatly overlaps with the new 17th district.
The map was redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were an unconstitutional manipulation of the constituency in favor of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive campaign funding race between the largest party funding groups, the DCCC (Democrat Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a closely followed supplantation election for Pennsylvania's 18th district to Congress in March last year.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a small lead.
U.S. Reviewed sanctions against El Salvador for support to China, then drew the threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a hearty meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the Trump Organization leadership team.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to recall the U.S. diplomats of El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, the ministry spokesperson, in a statement earlier this month.
However, the criminal measures were considered only against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug controls, development and financial support.
The proposed criminal measures, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials subjected a top-level conference focusing on security and economic growth to follow up a similar collection last year that was considered a step forward in attempting to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, officials in the top administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, which stopped all plans for criminal action against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now framed to speak to the conference, which is now scheduled in mid-October, to show the importance the administration adds to the collection, said the diplomat.
And the three U.S. emissaries returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new tough messages or criminal measures from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations under the assumption of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next nail in the coffin can be special advisor Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstacle to judicial exercise, which is now very solid proof of in public documents.
Mueller is allegedly also expanding the investigation into whether Trump’s campaign collaborated with Russia in our elections.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would be held accountable in that body, in the middle of the preparations to meet the voters again and perhaps ultimately a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertain factors, and I do not believe that Trump’s fall is inevitable — nor for his counterparts in Europe.
We all have to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West had risen against him and supported the Czechoslovakia at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath that followed.
The course of history revolves around such focal points, and the inexcusable March of democracy is accelerated or inhibited.
The Americans are facing several of these points now.
What will we do if Trump kicks Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in severe weather ever since this newspaper reported that he proposed secret interceptions of the president last year and speculated that he was unfit to be president.
Rosenstein says that The Times' manufacture is incorrect.
“How will we react if the recently implemented FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible abuse charges and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the middle election for a Congress that will put Trump in charge?
If we do not pass those tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail because of the experience I got in Prague.
My mother was a Checoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me off to light Sabbath lights on the table with the swastal cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not look optimistic about our future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic before meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers accept Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians after the impressive draw game in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season in the draw match 2-2 against Villarreal, but he thinks Rangers can use the result as a leapboard to make bigger things.
“It was a good point for us since Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31st year old.
“We went into the game and thought we could get something and got one point with us.
Maybe we could've got into the end, but the draw was probably a good result.
They were probably better in the first place, and we came out in the second half and were the best team.
On Thursday, there will be another big night in Europe.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last game, but with the home audience in the back, I am sure we can stand on and get a positive result.
The spring was absolutely tough, between everything that happened to my injuries and the replacements in the club itself, but there is a good feeling now.
The team is good and the boys are enjoying themselves; the training is good.
Hopefully we can stand on now, put the previous season behind us and get it done.”
Women lose night sleep because of the fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear understanding of how they wanted to be taken care of, few spoke to the family about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to the spouse about the costs of long-term care.
10% said they talked to the kids about it.
\"People want to be taken care of by someone in the family, but they do nothing to take that conversation,\" said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of yourself if you don’t say what you want in good time in advance.
Discuss with the advisor and family where and how the care is to be given. Such choices can be of great importance in determining the costs.
Take with you your financial advisor: The advisor can also help you find out how to pay for your expenses.
The financing options for long-term care may include a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses or self-assurance with your own assets - if you have enough money.
Work out your legal documents: Get rid of legal problems right away.
Get a health professional in place by appointing a person you trust to have an overview of your medical care, and make sure that health professionals will comply with your wishes if you are prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving some authority over your economy.
You choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you can’t do it yourself.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your old parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write the details in a list so you are prepared.
\"It's not just the economy that's at stake - who's the doctors?\" asked Martin.
\"What medicines do you need?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Keep that list in place\".
Man shot several times with an air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a gun of air when he was on his way home after an evening.
The victim, a man in the 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as an \"unmotivated action\".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police have called for witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and the deaths rates are expected to rise.
Communication is out of operation, and rescuers have not been able to obtain information from Dongala Regent, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regent that extends along more than 300 km by coastline in the northwest part of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, an administrative region below the provincial level, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the carrier beams of the Central Province of Sulawesi's economy, especially the Dongala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's emergency assistance administration.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
A tsunami also hit western Dongglaa in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A massive earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province north of Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of severe earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, and triggered a tsunami that struck the south coast.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands, outside Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 metres that demolished dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the rule of Pie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic while the people were reminded of the plagues of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombok and kills more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested after allegations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested after assault charges.
Palin, 29 years from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested after suspicion of domestic violence, clustering with a report on domestic violence and opposing arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he was reported to have taken the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged assault.
Palin is detained in Mat-Su detention prison and is arrested for an unsecured debt letter worth $500, reported KTUU.
He was presented to the court on Saturday, where he declared himself \"not guilty, absolutely\" when asked how he was facing the blame issue, the network reported.
Palin is confronted with three offenses of Class A, which means that he can be imprisoned for up to a year and put on a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with an offence of Class B, which can be punished by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time it has been charged with Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report the alleged assault.
The case is brought to Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, clustering with the report on domestic violence and holding a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are down, and the deaths are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just off central Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
It circulates videos on social media showing the outbreak.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami dubbed across the beach.
Federal prosecution authorities rarely seek the death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York City
Federal New York prosecutors seek the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people - a rare punishment that has not been committed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, reportedly used a Home Depot rental car to carry out an attack on a bike road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he meeted down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims \"intendedly\" and caused serious bodily injuries with intent, according to warning of intent to seek the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for the possible death penalty, according to the legal document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury 22 point charge, including eight counts of murder in connection with money blackmail, in the face of Saipov, normally used by federal prosecution authorities in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and wreckage of vehicles.
The attack called for \"significant planning and intent,\" said prosecutor, describing the way Saipov performed it as \"healthy, cruel and corrupt\".
\"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injuries, property and losses for the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco\", states the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York led a case that could give the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
Prior to the execution of the death penalty in a federal case in New York City, in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to perform espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to the court documents.
He told the investigators that he was happy with what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after watching ISIS videos on the mobile phone, according to the lawsuit.
He also asked to hang up the ISIS flag in the hospital room, the police said.
He did not plead guilty after the charges of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the publicly appointed defenders of Saipov, said they were \"openly disappointed\" by the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accepting a confession and life in prison without the possibility of release will only extend the traumas at these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecution authorities not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged to \"mobilize the army of the people\" today during a demonstration at the Tory Conference.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians should be given the \"feel pressure\" from the Eurosceptics, when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he be responsible for the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have “had to be out of date” now if Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge for May to reconcile its deeply divided ranks has been emphasized by pro-Remain Tories who participated in a demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Brexit plan on track against attacks by Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she will go on trying to get a deal with Brüssel despite the backlash — forcing eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and \"kaos\".
Bone told the \"Statement means release\" protesters in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a member and been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brüssel.
\"If he had been responsible, we would have been out now,\" he said.
Wellingborough MP added: \"I will stand on for Brexit, but we must reject the Brexit plan\".
When he was going to explain his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in two world wars to become subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismisses claims that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The claim that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely wrong.”
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration and told reporters: “I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Brexit plan is unpopular in the public. The opposition will not vote for it. It is unpopular in the party and with our activists, who are actually those who traverse the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Forget Brexit plan and start listening\".
In a direct message to May, she added: “State ministers keep the job when they keep their promises.”
Farage stated that politicians would get “feel the pressure” if they thought of betraying the decision taken by the 2016 referendum.
\"This is now about the trust between us -- the people -- and that politician,\" he said.
\"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to let them know they won't get away with it.\"
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to let our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
We mobilise the army of the people of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.\"
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham before having a two-hour political gathering in the center of the city.
A small amount of activists fanned with Tories Against Brexit banners after the launch of the group this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they had with a party app when the conference began.
“These are the people who tell us they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a friction-free limit, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,\" he added.
Warren is seriously considering running as a presidential candidate.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “consider seriously running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about the future during a town hall meeting west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was Vice President of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She has been central to the speculations if she is going to run against Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon in Holyoke, the event was her 36th meeting with electors, who have been using the Town Hall format since Trump became president.
A participant asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time that \"women get to Washington to fix our defective government, and it includes a woman on top\".
Arrest after Sims from LSU was killed by shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the shooting incident that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at a news conference at 11.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and requested help to identify a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near campus at Southern University early Friday.
\"Wayde Sims had a gunshot wound in his head and eventually died as a result,\" police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, 247sports said.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the scene carrying weapons, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without a boost and detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Chamber.
Sims was a two-metre-high youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 starting last season. His average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 returns per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton aims at the world championship after stable orders give him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes's stable order would play a major role in the race.
From pole, Bottas got a good start and almost swept Hamilton off the field while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and allowed Hamilton to continue driving in the rear of the main field, which should have been crucial.
Mercedes made a pit stop a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up after some bubbing with the wheels that allowed the Ferrari driver reluctantly to leave the inside after a double passage to defend himself in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the rear row of the field and entered as No. 7 at the end of his first round of his 21st birthday.
Then he led in much of the race while on the wheels to try to get to a quick finish and overcome Kimi Raikkonen who was at No. 4.
He finally came by the 44th round depot, but failed to increase the pace of the remaining eight rounds and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It is a difficult day because Valtteri did a fabulous job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me out.
The team has done a fabulous job to get a good two-span,\" Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein during a police event on Saturday for her arrest that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
When the president spoke during an event in West Virginia, he did not refer directly to Ford's testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what was going on in the Senate shows that people are \"bad, horrible, and speak untrue\".
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that’s been going on in the last few days of the Senate, when you’re experiencing the mind, when you see people who are angry and bad and horrible and talk untrue,” he said.
“When you look at deliveries and leaks, they say, “Oh, I haven’t.
I haven’t done it.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Remember her answer... did you leak the document--\"Oh, oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven’t leaked.”
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked... no, we didn't leak,\" he added, with a imitation of the Senator's voice.
Feinstein was sent the letter with detailed information about the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
\"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak her story,\" Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential as she requested.”
But her denial was not taken up by the president, who, during the Saturday night party event, commented: “I’ll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his continued defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used the allegations for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take power back with all the necessary means.
You see the madness, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to overrun to get power and control,\" the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss against the Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants received early two goal management via shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized for the home team before Dwyer restored the leadership of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalled for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League loss for the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come behind after they defeated Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the third meeting for the season between the teams, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came for the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford retired the game when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt added up to Cownies equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer assured the Giants that he was in charge of his second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard equalized once again with a masterful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran went together to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the game late in the second half, and he secured the victory with the team's five half way out in the final round.
Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Flyer dies to ensure that hundreds of air passengers escape earthquakes
A flight leader in Indonesia is hailed as after he died and secured that a plane that had hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy aftershock continues to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after colleagues had fled for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the highly swathing control tower at the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to see that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway just then, could safely ease.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died later in hospital.
The Air Navigation Indonesia spokesperson, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts broke when we heard it,” he added.
Authorities fear that the death tolls may rise to thousands, and the country's disaster emergency emergency agencies report that there is limited access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong.
\"The numbers are expected to rise further since many bodies are still trapped under the ruins and many have not been able to reach,\" said a spokesman for the body, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have demolished Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “All the time, ambulances are seen getting dead.
There is a lack of clean water.
The minimum markets are robbed everywhere\".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, stated to CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross works febrilish to help survivors, but we don’t know what they’ll find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?\" said CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Flights crashed in Micronesia: Air Niugini now report that a man is missing after aircraft crashed in lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed in a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean, Micronesia, now says that one man is missing. They earlier reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a press release that on Saturday afternoon there was one male passenger they did not have an overview of.
The airline said they collaborated with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request for more details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and the condition of everyone was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very low.
\"It's a very good thing,\" said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to wade through waist depth water to the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said the hosts were panicking and screaming, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
U.S. Navy said sailors who worked nearby to repair a brewer also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to carry people on land before the plane sank about 30 meters below the surface of the water.
Data from Aviation Safety Network suggests that 111 people have died in crashes with PNG registered aircraft in the last twenty years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analysts present the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution authorities closed the procedure on Saturday in a new trial for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
United States analysts in the Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours as expert witnesses in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile prints to breathe together the movement of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he collected location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which fought against what he had claimed earlier, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same place as Chambers' mobile phone during the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the testimony box on Saturday and claimed he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford's trailer that night, Sanford said that he \"was loose because my trailer was in Nashville\".
Another disagreement was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile printing suggests that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a little after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted calls, contact details, and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
\"He deleted her from his life,\" Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is community-friendly hip hop?
A hip hop-trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from its origin with political messages to address social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make community-friendly hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have experienced a new boom in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
Children's passports in New York are suing couples for resignation after \"racist\" message
A New York babysitter sues a couple for discriminatory termination after receiving a misdirected message from her mother, complaining that she was \"one black person\".
The couple rejects their racist nature and compares the lawsuit to \"expression\".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a two-child mother, expressed disappointment when she found that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up to her first working day in 2016.
\"NEEEEEII ONE A SVART PERSON,\" Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the taboo, it was a \"uncomfortable\" Plasco-Flaxman who resigned Maurice, claiming that their fired babysitter, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for his one working day and then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal and demands compensation in the order of $350 per day for the six-month, losji-based scheme she was promised, however without contract.
\"I wanted to show them that - hey, that's how you just don't,\" she said to the New York Post on Friday, adding, \"I know it's discrimination.\"
The couple has repudiated the charges that they are racist and says the resignation of Maurice was the only right, since they felt they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist,” stated the man Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
“But would you have left your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn child?
Come on.\"
The comparison of the lawsuit with \"expression\" says Plasco due to his wife having only two months to term and being in a \"very difficult situation\".
“Is there such a person you want to punish?
It’s not very nice,” added the stock broker.
While the legal case goes on, the popular court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticize them for their behavior and attitudes.
The publisher of Paddington feared that readers would not accept a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was assumed, said of the letter: “It is difficult to sit in the place of others when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s very fun to know what we now know about Paddington’s great success.”
She says her father, who had worked as a cameraman in the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book by a small bear, would have been very pleased that his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book release was \"bitter-sweet\" after he passed away last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important family member” and adds that her father was secretly very proud of the success he achieved.
\"He was a rather quiet man, and he was not a boasted person,\" she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child doing a feat: you’re proud of it even if it’s not your fault.
I think he considered Paddington's success a bit like that.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to give the credit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to the phone.
On landing, the daughter had been rushed to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
\"Nad called regularly to say that it looked bad, that he didn't think she would survive,\" Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got the phone from Nad who said she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, \"Tashi, I love you so much, my friend.
I'll come to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
Medicin the doctors had given her to make her heart beat, slowly lost her effect and left the system.
She died a while earlier and the organs of her body cleaved together.
I just had to sit there and wait, in the knowledge that it happened.
I couldn’t cry and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get myself together.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, went aboard the plane with the other passengers - who did not know about the trials she underwent.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I looked down all the time and tears ran in a steady stream.
It is hard to explain, but it was there on the plane I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcard with mourning women to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up a postcard on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers folded can call for help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 when he was hit by depression and killed when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parents to experience what I have to relive every day,” she says.
45-year-old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says that his son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
\"Everyone knew him on the smile.
They said that his smile could shine up any room.”
He left the job before he died because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was one of those who found him after he killed himself.
Sharon says, “I worry all the time that it will become an infectious effect.”
Sharon made the cards “to tell people that there are people out there that they can go to and talk to, even if it’s just a friend.
Don’t sit for yourself, you need to talk to someone.”
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost Mark, the partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
\"He didn't tell me he felt down or depressed or anything,\" she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed the changed mood.
On Christmas Day, he was in the basement — when the kids opened the Christmas gifts, they did not achieve eye contact or anything.”
She says his death was a major trauma to them, but they must fight through it: “It tears up a large hole in the family.
It's tearing us up.
But we all have to stand and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh’s future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI begins investigating
“I thought that if we could get something of what he asked for — a time and scope-limited investigation — we might be able to reach a certain consensus,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee “fell apart” along fixed party boundaries.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The rejection is due to the timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, November 6, if Republicans probably do bad, it will be much harder for them to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling Senators and lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and hit his wife Ashley there when she was a personal secretary of Bush.
What happens after the FBI has delivered its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are at the moment 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, so Vice President Mike Pence can use his double voice and have him admitted to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors \"falls\" under Kim
The number of North Korean defections to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator stated.
Park Byeong Seug, referring to data from South Korea’s Ministry of Collection, said there had been 1127 defections last year — compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park stated that stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices in human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented on it publicly.
Most defectors from North Korea are eventually offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China sees the defectors as illegal migrants and not refugees and returns them with power.
The relationship between North and South, which is technically still at war, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries of Pyongyang met for talks on the locked negotiations on denucleization.
This happened after the historic meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work largely for an atomic-free Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the US sanctions for lack of progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions there is no possibility that we will unilaterally rust down first,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh \"hysteria\" and says he is unfit to sit in the Supreme Court
Minority leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Supreme Court student Brett Kavanaugh \"hysteric\" and said he had a temper that made him unfit to sit in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the statements in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had acted like this, she would be called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied his sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, sometimes almost shouting and crying when he was talking about his family and years in high school.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the allegations against him a \"gross and coordinated character killing\" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony shows that he cannot sit in the Supreme Court since it shows that he is predestined against Democrats.
\"I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats,\" she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was approved and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
\"I want to say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he's not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he's sitting in now,\" Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was worried about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (absolute rights), since he is considered to be a Conservative judge.
In the questioning, Kavanaugh avoided whether he would oversee certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time to send a hysterical, biased person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it,” Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
It is a fair anger, months and years in which the mind takes over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
“We cry when we are angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s so weird, do you?”
She continues: “I got good help from a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said that she also cries when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she spoke to “you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.\"
And then she just went on.
I thought I was amazing.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs was in a man-dominated office. I started crying with inexplicable rage and was caught in the neck collar by an older woman - a cool boss I had always been a little scared of - who brought me to a stairway room.
“Don’t let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sad and happy because they managed to take you.”
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he was running for the presidency.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to be unfaithful to the spouse on board a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Schroeder was very frustrated and thought that there was nothing in the way of investigating the opportunities to run for president himself.
“It wasn’t a thoughtful decision,” she said with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last ones they needed were one more.
Some called it \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\".
Since it was close to the end of the campaign, she left with the funding and vowed that she would not run if she did not receive $2 million.
It was a lost game.
She discovered that some of the supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount, or?” she asked.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings —thanks to the people who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to drive money and reach voters instead of delegates, as well as anger over sexism — that she collapsed in tears.
\"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown,\" Schroeder recalls how the press called her.
\"You'd think that Cleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking what they would write on my grave?
\"She cried?\"
How the U.S.-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The openings of the trade war between the United States and China were deaf, and although the struggle is far from over, a rift between the countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by customs duties on important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important escalation occurred this week with new customs rates of goods worth $200 billion, meaning toll of half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has, of course, returned every time, now at the latest with a five to ten percent increase in U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match the U.S. attacks for attacks, and the world’s second largest economy will probably not lift the white flag with the first.
Getting Washington to step down means giving in to demands, but public submission to the United States will be too humiliating for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure around the trade war with the United States can give positive pronunciation to China in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create relationships that start economic ring effects in one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than the spectators have realized in the past,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a mindmie.
Syria \"ready\" for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says they are ready for voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help to return the country, which is demolished after more than 7 years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said that the conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress of fighting terrorism,” he said.
The state continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now ready for voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their everyday lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war started in 2011.
In addition, there are six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime will welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that it would not be accepted conditional assistance or aid from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times after each other on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the throne when the team of Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn received the 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who wiped out during much of the tournament, meted his tee battles in the water at pairs-3,16th holes, and had to be defeated by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant on all his rounds and became 1 of 4 golfers who have ever gone 5-0-0 since the tournament got its current design in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 and 4 of the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup final.
With all eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind it, the Spanish Sergio Garcia tournament became the most winning Europeans throughout the time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t stop.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas picked me up and had faith in me.
I am very, very happy to get the cup back.
It’s about the team, and I’m glad I could help,” said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He leaves the relay stick to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in single games on Sunday.
\"I'm incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods - I followed that man closely in growing up,\" said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career points in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the biggest golfers ever, who has won 14 major titles, only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
The team spent the whole weekend finding the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf with high precision throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furykk stated after a disappointing achievement for his squad, \"I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
It was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves.
Hat off for Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and will look forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be your team captain.
You just have to take off your hat.
We were beaten.”
