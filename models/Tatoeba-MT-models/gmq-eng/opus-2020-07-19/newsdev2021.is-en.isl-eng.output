Biden leads the polls into three key countries
When there are only 100 days of election, Joe Biden, a provoking Democrat, is ahead of three important fluctuations.
CNN reports today that Biden was transferred to Florida, Arizona, and Michigan.
In Florida, Biden measures 51% to 46% with the president.
In Arizona the position is 49%—45% Biden in favour, and in Michigan the position is towards Biden's superior position, resulting in 12 points, 52%—40%.
To win the election in November, after 100 days, Trump needs to turn all these states around, and indeed more.
Trump’s presence in these days is a crown - virus epidemic of which the country’s teaching and telling the vast majority of the world’s questions have failed badly, or very badly, at the start of the epidemic.
In addition, Trump has caused a bad result from protests and riots that sprinkling up at the death of George Floyd.
If Trump and his government have acted badly or wrongly on these matters.
To crown Trump's problem, he is now under severe criticism for ordering federal police to break behind protests in cities where mayors or mayors are Democrats.
It has created an enormous tumult among the inhabitants of the city, and that anger is transmitted to other Americans.
Furthermore, photos of federal policemen to pinch Protestants into unmarked cars have not helped the United States cause.
The guard advertisement The Lincoln Project just attention to this, but she can be seen here below.
Trump won all three states in 2016, but with a very small vote.
In fact, Trump won many states with little votes and won the elections with less votes.
Michigan, for example, won with only 10,704 events.
It's less than 0.5% of the population.
Nearly all of the opinions that politicians say are significant are to show the same conclusion that Biden is being taken forward.
A new CNN scan in Arizona shows that the advance Biden is now presented from the scope of the survey.
The same goes for the CNN and Quinnipiac University surveys about Florida.
Even Fox News, who leaned to the right and declared support for Trump 2016, has published the same material in its media.
The last hope of the President, according to the findings of the questioners, is that Trump might have the prospect of reworlding in important locations within the flexibility of the campaign if attention is focused on the economy.
The U.S. economy took a heavy blow after the Covid-19 epidemic, but it seems that the voters are not associating the economic impact with the crown virus epidemic.
That is, the vast majority of voters seem to teach Trump that he has been in a bad position to respond to the crown virus epidemic, but trust him better to deal with the economic downturn that is at present in the state.
However, Trump has failed to direct the discussion in the campaign.
Following the troubles that have been burning almost continuously since the news was broadcast by the video, where four policemen killed George Floyd, Trump tried to direct the discussion into law enforcement and its importance.
Law and Order became his typical word.
It seems now to have failed altogether, as previously said.
As the polls lean more on Trump, more and more Republicans are more likely to leave Trump behind and declare support for either Biden, or someone else, who is then Biden without specifically mentioning him.
They do so because of the arrangement in the United States to vote in many elections on the same order.
Thus, the vote may simply be marked by the second class of the presidential part of the order of vote, and it may be accepted as a vote by all other candidates of that class on the vote.
Thus, candidates of the Republican Party are tempted to withdraw from the sloping gang of Trump and to succeed independently in the elections.
The Olympics of Youth in Dakar have been postponed to 2026
Youth’s Olympics were due to take place in Dakar next year, but they have now been postponed to 2026 because of the crown virus epidemic after the International Olympic Committee and Senegal agreed to do so.
However, the temptation of the first Olympic games to take place in Africa is a shock to many young athletes.
A volunteer arrested because of the fire in Nantes
A volunteer in the Church of Nantes, France, has been arrested in connection with fires that destroyed the church.
Le Monde has, after the prosecutor, acknowledged that the suspect Rwandan fugitive who served as an overseer in the church has set fire on fire.
In a conversation with another media, a man says that he is a great observer of his actions.
Among what was destroyed in the fire was an organ from the 17th century C.E., and the historically pictured windows of the church.
The 39 - year - old volunteer was arrested shortly after the fire on July 18, last, and he was released.
He was then returned to a report yesterday and then in custody.
"No way out of this"
It is well received to me in the house of Baltasar and in the house of Christian Samper of Copavogi.
The occasion of my visit is Baltasar's new art exhibition and his daughter, Mireya, which will be opened on August 1st, in the sound of Little Kambi, Snællsnæs.
Is this the first time the fathers show up together.
I am led down to Baltasar’s office, where great paintings come to my attention.
Big and dreary pictures of old-time chicks as well as of flying creatures; eagles on one, shadows of birds on another.
From the workplace, the home is being developed.
“We had a horse here with us who bit the grass,” Baltasar says to me.
"The horse works much better than a lawn mower on these hills and hills we have."
Mireya and I are with Kristina and Baltasar, and she tells us how her work deals with the works here.
“ Introductions, combinations of paper products and sculptures.
They're all very white and in contrast to what Dad's doing, because I'm working with the light and like that," she says.
“ It was a year ago that idea came up.
Then there were certain tasks I was working for and wanted to show there, but they got stuck in Tokyo over Covid.
When my father started to paint and I saw where he was going, I rethinked my party," says Mirya, but Baltasar's work has a strong appeal in Icelandic legends about women's scorpions and conditions.
“ When I saw that my dad was doing these paintings with the girls, I felt like doing jewelry related to them, ” says Mireya, but she works with a Victor No. Bjarnason goldsmith at the Sign store.
"So I'll make an insertion out of the card."
Last year, Mireya attended 72 artists of the Academy of Reasons at Snæfellsneu, including in the barn of Little Kambi and found the building fascinating.
“ This is a new space, an old barn that has just been built, ” says Mireya, who talked to Baldvina Sverrisdóttidt artist, who suggested that Mireya and Baltasar put together a show.
“ She wanted us both to show, and we thought:
“ Why not?
This is a good idea."
Baltasar Samper was born in 1938 in Spain and studied at the University of Art in Barcelona before he was on a world journey.
He came here in Iceland in 1961 and was impressed by the land and the nation.
He came back here shortly later, met his wife, Kristius, and has lived here continuously since 1963, for 57 years.
Baltasar is a productive artist, has kept dozens of private shows, and shows with the great Christian world.
He is best known for his large wall pictures, including a wall decoration in the Church of Flat Island and a fresco in the Church of Hornet.
“ What affects what I do is the bitter thing Iceland has and no other place, ” says Baltasar.
“ These low suns and those shadows that stretch and stretch.
As soon as I got here, I thought, "Wow, here you can work."
Mireya is the oldest of the children of Kristius and Baltasar, born in 1964.
“ There was one thing I knew, it was quite clear that I wasn’t going to be a movie artist,” she asked if she wanted to follow in her parents ’ footsteps.
“ So I went to high school to the size and nature path and did everything I could to get away with it.
Then I realized that I was running away.
Then you just have to give up," says Mirya and laugh.
She, like her father, has shown many things around the world.
A lot in Japan, to form.
All the children of Baltasar and Kristian have been on the road.
"I call this a virus," says Mireya.
"There was no way out of this."
Icelandair's count has been in a grey area when flight attendants were cancelled
Minister of Trade believes that Icelandair has been in a grey area when the partner gave up all the flight attendants in the middle of a barracks.
In that case, he claims that laws that prevent firemen from entering a house - to - house will be taken into consideration after the fire on Brothers’ Streets.
On July 17 Icelandair advised to terminate all 38 flight attendants who worked with his partner while the airline was still at the state convention.
There were divisions as to whether Icelandair was able to respond to these statements and were prepared to be resolved before the Social Court.
This was never the end of the day, however, when flight attendants and Icelandas met for more than 24 hours after the layoffs.
However, Minister of Social Affairs Einar Daddaron says that in his mind, Icelandair’s decision was in a grey area and went to the right of the wage earners.
“ My opinion is that this is a legal right to protect wage earners.
When you're in a conversation, when you're inside of a sympathizer, it's not an option to go this way.
It is quite clear to me that this was not the case.
I think it's quite clear, in my mind, that men had entered a grey area there what this touched," says Asmundur.
He will not thus speak for other companies to go the same way as Icelandair.
“Now, too, a dangerous discussion is about the normal start to jump up this system in order to reduce this right, and so I am totally opposed. ”
At Splengissand this morning, Åsmundur was also asked about the reaction of governments to the fire on the brotherhood path at the end of June, when three died.
The minister now says the study on the board of Husnad and a civil engineering agency, to which he directed recommendations.
“ It is a law today that the fire cannot enter a house of residence.
I have asked the Agency to examine specifically whether there is a reason for any legislative change.
I'm ready to bring about the legal changes needed to reduce the likelihood that this can happen again," says Asmundur Einar.

United States reportedly increasing pressure on operators North Stream 2 - RT Business News
According to Welt am Sonntag, the United States government has made further efforts to force European companies to abandon the gas pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which has been led by Russia, citing people who are familiar with the issue.
According to the newspaper, the officials of the Foreign Ministry, the Ministry of Finance, and the U.S. Department of Energy have contacted European contractors to ensure that they are aware of the consequences of continuing in the project.
Up to twelve officials should have held at least two online meetings with representatives of the companies in the last days.
Those who witnessed the talks said that the Americans had a “friendly” tone stressed that the United States wanted to prevent North Stream 2 from being realized.
“I think it’s a very, very serious threat, ” said one third of the German media.
These threats are in line with the U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo's report last week, warning that companies involved in the project would be best to “come out now” or to be at risk of punishment according to the 232st of the notorious Code Counting America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
In addition to the Russian energy crisis, Gazprom, who oversees the development of the project, shares five European companies in it.
These are the French company Engie, OMV from Austria, the British-Holland company Royal Dutch Shell as well as Winter Hall and Uniper from Germany.
In a conversation with Welt am Sonntag, a representative of the last company said that the United States of America’s attempts to undermine “a major infrastructure project” were clearly involved in the European state.
In the past week, the U.S. Council of Representatives approved a change in the law on national defence intended to extend the US sanctions against companies participating in the installation of the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
According to one of the transporters of the legal framework, such measures may target companies providing or providing ships, insurance, refusal or connection services for such ships, as well as those offering a service for Nord Stream 2.
Both European companies and public officials have repeatedly expressed their disapproval of US efforts to share European energy by applying sanctions against North Stream 2, and some have even called for Brussels to work on transactions.
Officials in Moscow have also criticized the actions of Washington harshly and called it unfair competition.
Earlier this week, the president of the President, Dmitri Peskov, said that Russia would come up with a new plan on how the mission will be completed if Washington officials keep the new sanctions under way.
Preparing further transfer of public institutions to a country
The Minister for Economic Affairs and Labour intends to transfer more public institutions to the country in the near future.
The Brunvararna area of the Institute of Housing and Human Resources will be moved north in the autumn of the Minister’s decision, but experts within the department have previously declared that they intend not to move north.
Asmundur Einar Daddarson, Minister for Social Affairs and Children's Affairs, said in Splengisand, at Bylundy this morning, that it is important for the countryside that there be official organizations.
Thus, there is a high level of value creation that also creates diversity.
“ It’s so important, we’re trying to build everything around the country.
Building jobs, creating economical structures, whether in travel services, agriculture, industry, some use of nature and this type of activity as public jobs, they are very supportive of their construction," says Asmundur.
“ Creates increased diversity, creates better support for this resource and the creation of the nation’s currency. ”
Asmundar’s decision to move the burning areas of the House and Civilian Institute has been severely criticized by its employees and the National Union for Fire and Medical Transport.
Six men who have expertise in burning matters and work in the department are all located in the capital area and none of them are planning to move the livestock to the sheep’s claw.
“ I think it is quite clear that there are political changes in how hard it should be.
My view is, and has always been, that we should attack radical measures to better distribute the official jobs," says Asmundur.
“ We see that our neighboring nations, the Norwegians, and the Danes have been doing this successfully. ”
He claims to be convinced that the vast majority of the nation want to see a greater distribution of public institutions across the country.
"I think it is necessary to make further political decisions on the transfer of public service to a country, as I was doing with the House and Civilian Institute."
He takes an example of the transfer of Food Institute to the island of Iceland, the Land measures of Iceland, and unemployment insurance in Skagastres.
“ There is a place of work on Skagaströn today, which is of great importance to that society.
I think we should take further steps in this being."
“ I’m preparing further steps in this being.
More transport."
On the 50th arrest in Seattle
Systemic racism and the US President’s decision to send federal police forces to cities in order to bring an end to malnutrition was protested in many parts of the world.
In the 50 ’ s, Seattle was arrested.
The Seattle police used blast bombs and pepper sprays in large protests where yesterday the police have described them as bad.
21 policemen were injured, and at least 45 protesters were arrested.
Two months after the death of a police officer named George Floyd, there was a period of protest against systemic racism.
The protests were made to show a consensus between Protestants in Portland.
There have been repeated conflicts between police and Protestants after the U.S. president sent to the U.S. federal police forces, which have been driving unmarked cars, to unthank the authorities.
Thousands gathered in Portland this weekend and used tear - up and rubber - ball polices when they were in an urgent relationship with Protestants.

The American reality star Kenya Moore is doing well by strengthening people who need technological fertilization.
Moore, known for her participation in The Real Housewives of Atlanta’s first child, was born 47 years after ART and called her daughter the miracle child.
“ Almost all my life wait for a baby, ” said Moore in an interview with People.

Moore realized that she was running out of time when she was 40 years old.
“ I didn’t want a baby alone.
I didn't want to be a single mother.
So I waited and after 40 years, I looked up and thought my God good," said Moore, who did not meet her father-in-law until she was 46 years old.

The home market balance of heroin was about 15.5 million rupees, which was smuggled from Myanmar, according to the police.
A man and his son were arrested with 1.9 kg of heroin in the Hnahthial district of Mizoram, near the Mjanmar border, followed by police on Sunday.

Duhkima (62) and his son Remthangpuia (33) were arrested with drugs on Friday night in the village of Ngharchhip, said the police.
They also lost some 280 grams of heroin, worth about 1.5 million rupees when they swam over, on their escape from the police, according to what was done at the office.
According to police reports, this is considered to be one of the largest quantities of heroin that have been held in the state.
The defendants were brought to justice according to appropriate articles on drugs and antipsychotics (NDPS) from 1985.
Even if a borderline between the states and Myanmar is closed because of the crown virus epidemic, there is nothing to be done about drugs and other commodities, according to police information.

A doctor ran 35 miles [35 km] with a mask
Your British doctor, Tom Lawton, ran over 35 miles [35 km] with a mask of the face to show that oxygen saturation did not decrease with a mask of the face.
Lawton is a doctor at the Bradford Royal Hospital and has worked there during the pandemic.
To dissuade the theory of oxygen saturation and to encourage people to wear a mask of face, Lawton decided to run to work and return with a mask.
Before he left, he set up a collection of GoFundMe for The Trusell Trust, which deals with food supplies in Bradford and elsewhere in Britain.
“ I am a great supporter of all that keeps us safe.
That's why I've been in shock with the wrong information that's spread between people that facial mask reduces oxygen saturation in people," said Lawton.
Lawton said that he had previously competed for three years, but during his pandemic, he would have been less patient with him.
On Monday, last Monday, he ran about 35 miles [35 km].
“ I never took off the mask (no food or drink) and the oxygen saturation increased 98% every time I looked,” wrote Lawton on Twitter after running.

Gottlieb warns that the unfailing spread of the crown virus in society makes it “very difficult” to open schools in the fall
Washington — Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, warned on Sunday that it will be “very difficult” for schools to open up in a new year of study if the crown virus spreads unfailingly within these communities.
“ I believe that local authorities need to examine how the distribution is in the community.
If the virus spreads freely in the community, it will be very difficult to open up in that state," said Gottlieb in the Face the Nation.
As the fall of the next week began, Trump’s government had encouraged the school authorities to open up their school to students and to offer school instruction five days a week.
However, these attempts by President Trump and the Minister of Education, Betsy DeVos, come a week after Trump warned that the crown virus epidemic would probably “be off before it recovers ” and confirmed that schooling in the worst places might need to delay school opening for a few weeks.
Nevertheless, on Thursday, disease defense centers issued guidance on how best to open schools to students.
The instructions include the removal of schools between people's security, students and staff, the recommendation to use facial protection and the switch of students into distinct groups to reduce the risk of infection.
However, the Centers for Disease Control did not set out the criteria for school managers to close schools if crown virus infections are increasing, as Gottlieb says, “unsatisfactory”.
“ Once this uncertainty and precise instructions have not been provided about how schools will be opened, I think more parents will be careful, ” he says.
“ That’s why I think it’s very important to get precise information about the exact standards that the disease defence centres did not provide in their instructions. ”
Gottlieb said school districts must think about the percentage of positive infections in society, localization, and testing potential when deciding whether to keep schools open or switch the alpha into online teaching.
If between 5 and 10% of the analyses, a positive conclusion is “becomes difficult” but more than 10% is “the threshold when careful consideration is given to closing the school sentence.”
“ This is a sign that the journey reached a foothold in the community, ” said Gottlieb, adding that this would make parts of Florida, the center of the crown virus epidemic in the United States difficult to open up for school teaching in the next month.
Chronuvirus infections have increased in more than 30 countries and Colombia, while the focal point of the epidemic is located in the sun’s belt, known as the South Coast of the United States.
However, Gottlieb said that there was evidence of slowing down the number of cases in some countries, including Arizona and Texas.
Yet, although Gottlieb had said that there was a “separable sign” that some countries in the sun belt had started to slow down, including South Carolina, Alabama, India, and Illinois.
Many governors have put in place rules that oblige people to use masks in public spaces and have stopped the goal of re-opening in order to resist the spread of the crown virus.
Gottlieb said that government should consider closing bars, limiting the number of people in restaurants, closing cinemas, and other places that offer entertainment inside and laying down rules on masking to overcome the epidemic, which are measures that enable it to avoid resuming the strict limits set in March.
In addition, some countries have made masking use the responsibility of various companies to make use of facial protection.
McDonald's is the latest company to make use of facial defences and to be added to a group of companies such as Walmart, Starbucks and others who have put their own rules on masking.
Gottlieb said that he assumed that more companies would take up a masking obligation, especially where the risk is considered high.
“If we can really control the epidemic when the winter approaches until we get vaccines or any kind of treatment that changes the clinical course of this disease, we can do it with masks, it’s relatively simple, something that we can all do, but that doesn’t exactly change our lives and allows us to keep what’s very important to us, like keeping some companies open and getting the kids back to school,” he says.
Despite the fact that Donald Trump said last week that he did not want to use masking in the whole country, he urged the Americans last week to use facial defenses and told the White House press conference that “they have an impact. ”
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson: “It is a matter to expect”
Crystal Palace’s adherents were struck for the summer when Roy Hodgson, the manager of the community, declared that the leader of Wilf Zaha wanted to leave the company.
The artist has played at Selhurst Park for more than five years and now seems to be leaving, but he has previously been put to a team such as Arsenal and Bavaria Munich.
Since he is now 27 years old, it is to be seen whether a team of the quality class is still willing to pay high summers for him, especially in the financial uncertainty of the sport this summer, after a period of Zaha cut four limits and made five subsidies for the Palace team that caused a few disappointments.
In an interview with Alex Crook at TalkSport after the last play of the season, Hodgson said that “times were to be expected” regarding the possible departure of Zaha after confirming that the visitor had“ made it clear” that he saw his future elsewhere than the partner.
There are three more years left of the conventioner’s appointment at Palace, and last year the Society indicated that a 100 million pounds would be needed to deliver it.
The Hodgson period ended with a seven - in - a - row period on the last day of the period, which caused the team to fall to the 14th place.
Zaha found the netmask only once from mid - December to the end of the period with a long shot at the loss against Chelsea.
It was reported that he had asked for sale last summer when he tried to get away from his partner, but no offer came to tempt Palace to sell.
Zaha changed his agent in January, that it seems to increase the chances of leaving the company, and in the next few weeks it will no doubt be a priority for him to secure social change.
Zaha is the player who played most minutes in the first English department for the Palace during the period and was the only player of the team under 28 years of age who played 1,100 minutes or more, showing how much rebuilding on the team might be necessary with the funds available for the player.
The Hurricane Hannah: The Texas Korean-skinned virus is at high risk of disaster in a “twofold plague”
Weather news reports have predicted “disasters” in the south of Texas after the hurricane Hannah reached two times a country, resulting in high rains and wind levels up to 20 feet [40 m] per second.
When he reached the beach on Saturday, he was classified as a first stage storm (bottom score of five points) and he has now been brought down into a tropical storm, but the rain could still reach 150-300 mm on Sunday and the wind could reach 26 meters per second.
In some areas, rain has reached up to 230 mm, including Cameron County at the Mexican border.
Hannah was the first hurricane in the Atlantic by 2020 and weatherman Chris Birchfield advised residents to be careful: “This is not close yet; we are still expecting disaster.”
In the last few weeks, Texas has been struggling with a large increase in chronic viral infections.
The governor Greg Abbott published a disaster report for 23 counties on the way to the storm, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston, and Brazoria.
“ All hurricanes are a tremendous challenge.
This challenge is complex and even more difficult as the hurricane passes through an area that has become the worst out of COVID-19," said Greg.
The hurricane first arrived at the land at 17:00 p.m. on Saturday, 24 miles north of Port Mansfield, about 210 miles south of Corpus Christi.
The second time was not far from the east of Kennedy County.
Over 43,700 people in South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Brownsville, were electric without electricity on Saturday night.
In Corpus Christi’s emergency service set up gardens near the streets to allow them to be used in the event of a flood across the streets.
The president of the United States of America, Donald Trump, said that governments were watching Hannah and the hurricane Douglas, who headed for Hawaii in the Pacific.
Sherry Boehme, who lives on the shore of Corpus Christi, said that the storm approaching had increased the anxiety that she felt as a result of the pandemic.
This 67 - year - old woman had remained mostly at home because of health problems associated with chronic lung disease.
She said: “It’s almost like a double hit for us.
I think a lot of people are nervous.
We'll get through this.
They are all good and strong, and stand together."
Hey, there's a blushing cruise in South Africa.
In the summer, the weather has been extremely good in South Africa, and the weather has been the best for farmers.
Most of them are finished with the first beat, another beat is in many places, and they are expected to catch the third beat at the end of the summer.
The weather has been playing with southern farmers like the rest of the community this summer, not ruining the leap on the countenance of farmers.
So, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
A conqueror of Augustus, a hive at Birtinga Holti, in the Husman Troup, and an expert in hearing are happy and happy.
“ Yes, it’s just been fine, I think farmers must just be broken, it’s been fine for the last half of the month.
Hey, the good end of the harvest is good and the good of the hays is fine,' says Victor.
Victory says that it is growing, especially in the cow farmers, that they are in flat pits or conditions, which have given very well, but it is a long time to do in the roll - up hearing.
“ It’s lively, yes, yes, it’s actually been very comfortable for the past six months or three weeks, it’s been so dry and good and it’s so comfortable to deal with.
It remembers everything, it's less stress and can be stored for the morning sometimes what could be done today, so it's brilliantly comfortable.
But does victory mean that some farmers will strike three times?
“ Yes, I could quite believe it, the first ones.
We started June 17th, it might be those who were the first have to take three things."
The wolf's original solution--This is how they prevent injuries.
The Kantman Adama Traoré, who plays with Wolves in the English department, is a tremendously fast player.
His opposers have been moved to seize him to make sure that he does not get past them.
This has caused his shoulder to fall apart several times, but now the wolves have solved the problem.
The Sun's reporting.
In Wolves against Crystal Palace, medical personnel were allowed to anoint something on their shoulders at Traoré.
“ This is something we had to do to protect Traoré, ” says a source inside Wolves, who was carrying him was child oil.
“ Making him smoother makes it harder for defenseers to grab him, and that’s how we can prevent further injury. ”
Traoré's shoulder fell off first when Wolves played against Tottenham in December.
Since then, the shoulder has fallen off four times, now last time against Sheffield United earlier this month.
News by Harry England Prince: A friend of the duke of Sussex protests statements in a new book that has been between the teeth of people
In a conversation with Sky News, Stott said that the contents of the book about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were in no different subject of gossip, the only difference being that the book was bound up.
The former soldier wants his view to be increased directly to the positive things he and his wife have provided, such as their charity work.
Stott said: “I feel that what is expressed there does not differ from what we read in the gossip magazines, except now in the book. ”
“ There is a storyteller who tells us, but it is not certain that this has come from them. ”
“ I think it’s just another attack on them, just like the gossip sheets that persecute them. ”
“ I realize that they’re on the scene, and people want to know what they’re doing, but I wanted it to be more about all the good they’ve done and their charity, rather than their personal affairs. ”
“ Of course, they never get rid of it, because of their position. ”
The support of the duke and the duke of Sussex overshadowed another member of the royal family, according to one expert in the history of the royal family.
Kate Williams told Sky News that the royal family had failed to use starry Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in their behalf.
It added that the power orders within the royal family were established, but that the public interest could not be controlled.
She also said: “The fact is that all they did to support the queen had a tendency to overshadow another member of the royal family, and this was considered a problem. ”
"They're very popular."
“ They had less weddings than most siblings in the same position, Andrew had a huge wedding, and Anne also had a huge wedding. ”
“ Although Harry and Meghan’s wedding were smaller than William and Katrina’s wedding, news was of the same magnitude, because of the great interest of the world in the couple. ”
Donald Trump admits that he often regrets his voice on Twitter
Donald Trump has admitted that he often regrets his comments on Twitter, which is a source of war.
In an interview with Barstool Sports on Friday, the president of the United States said that his unexamined reinformation of Twitter messages — some of which have contained material from the white raceism — got him in the most trouble.
When the journalist Dave Portnoy asked him if he was looking for his posts, Trump replied: “Too, too many times.
It was like this in the old days, before this came, that you wrote a letter and said that this letter was very large.
You put it on your desk and then you came back the next day and said, “Oh, how glad I am that I didn’t send it,” right?
But we don't do it with Twitter.
We send it out right away, we feel great, and then you start getting calls — “Did you really say that? ”
I say, "What's wrong with this?" and you'll find out something."
Last month, Trump caused great anger after returning an entry (shared material from another account) with a video of his supporters in the Villages area of Florida, where an elderly couple called "White Power!" or "White Power."
And in 2017, Trump restored three passages directed against Muslims, published by Jaydu Fransen, the leader of the British First Right-wing Party.
The president told Portnoy that the renovations that had caused him the most trouble
Trump said: “A word that looks good and does not investigate, you understand, and you don’t know exactly what it says on the helmet, which is tiny and you don’t grow it, sometimes — I’ve found that it’s almost always the recovery that gets you into trouble. ”
The president often shares his commendation, a voice about his opponents, and a conspiracy with 80 million of his followers on Twitter.
Trump says Twitter helps him to get through the so - called “fascist news ” of television programs and newspapers, which he says is controlled by untruth.
However, the President’s own lies have often come under a microscope, and now Twitter means Trump’s records are misleading.
The GPS system may be insecure
Many governments are working to develop a different location technique than the GPS system.
An engineer says that there may be reasons to worry about the security of the GPS system, which is owned by the United States Army.
The old Loran system has been relaunched.
The GPS technology follows us every step of the way.
We use it when we fly, sail, and drive, when measuring land, in industry, and in leisure time.
Most people do not think of it as a military device in the hands of a United States army, which first opened it up for general use in the 1980 ’ s.
GPS technology uses satellite coordinates at 20,000 miles (20,000 km) above ground, so natural conditions have little effect on it.
“ But it is very easy to interrupt her.
And malicious people can easily interfere with the reception of these signs," says Sæmundur E. Thorsteinsson, professor of engineering at the University of Iceland and expert on risk management and communication security.
He also makes it easy to send an error mark with an incorrect location, such as in warfare.
“ The GPS system is owned by the U.S. Department of Defence.
They have assured the public that the system exists at all times.
But certainly they can turn this off if it pushed into the head of a very curious President to let do such, he could probably do it," says Sämundur.
Thus, many governments are thinking of other systems and positioning techniques.
Both Russia and China operate their own satellite system, and the European Union is depriving Galileo of its location system.
“ The Galileo system is primarily built for civil use.
It may have a greater degree of accuracy and is naturally under the control of the European Union.
Then there is not only one government that can control it completely but many,' says Sæmundur.
But many are also looking back to the old loran technology.
It's based on radio waves and was used from the '60s until GPS technology took over.
The loran-signs are sent on very long waves from below the earth.
“ It is then a new version of the Lóran system, called eLoran, which stands for Enhanced Loran, that people seriously look at it in many countries to have it as a reserve system, because it is somewhat different laws to interfere with it; it is much more difficult than to interfere with artificial systems, ” says Sämundur.
However, it is likely the best way to have access to most of the localization systems.
An experienced senator Vern Buchanan died of the crown virus
“Gary was a professional in fingertips and a loyal servant of the public, ” said Buchanan on Facebook.
“ He touched so many and was loved and admired by those who knew him.
I will never forget how exhilarating he was, the sense of humor and the joy he received from helping others."
Buchanan’s office published a statement earlier in the month that Tibbetts had no recent contact with others in the office.
Tibbetts, who worked outside the office, had served for Buchanan since 2011.
Florida has reported 414.511 cases since the start of the pandemic, which is more than 411,200 cases in New York City, according to the health authorities of the countries.
The data of the state’s health authorities show that hospitalizations have increased by 79% since the United States’ day of the national festival, July 4.
The data also show that at least 50 ICUs in Florida reached tolerance levels on Saturday.
“We informed that this could have an impact, ” said DeSantis in June.
“ At the same time, police work and the restraining of this could have a reverse effect. ”
Flight from Hornaifir to Cape Town
The bulldoves, rosethorns, ringdoves, crossbows, glitches, and weeps are among the birds that have been flocked to land this summer.
On the website of the Southeast Birds Hospital, brief news about the convicts, where they have been seen, and sometimes their breeds, can be seen on a daily basis.
They are many bird lovers in Iceland.
To that end, you can see the number of people who like the Facebook page Icelandic bird species.
The group has approximately 14,600 members.
There are shared images of birds, and it is evident that Iceland is rich in good photographers who have the patience needed to make birds.
Brynjälf Brynjällf's son is one of them.
There, as he is called, is a member of the Birds Review Centres of the Southeast and the Nature Office of the Southeast, and is closely monitoring the birds ’ lives in that area.
He speaks beautifully of these animals that enrich life in Iceland and play an important role there, and then it doesn’t matter whether the bird is a large and large bird of prey or a small sparrow.
The 2005 bird study center was founded on the birthday of Halfdán Björnsson, in the Archaeologists of Microbes, with the aim of continuing to carry on the extensive nature studies he conducted since 1940.
“ When he began to learn information about birds, he was thirteen years old, ” says Brynjälur, in a conversation with the Kjarnan.
“ We at the bird collection center are not doing exactly what Half-Dah did, but we are building on his data by counting and marking birds. ”
Half-dead was a farmer and a global scientist, born March 14, 1927.
He wrote many scientific articles on plants, insects, and bird life.
He died on February 10, 2017, barely nine years old.
The half - dead and his siblings in the Crowds aroused the interest of many of them in Icelandic nature.
In that group, Björn Gerli Annarson, “the servant ” of the Birds Control Station, is a member of the United Nations Organization for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions.
A bear grew up in the Sanhedrin field in the South, and he had a abundant waste of natural life with his neighbor, Half Death in the Chicks.
What, though, is now the kind of thing that the Birds View Center in the Southeast is doing?
By March 20, each year, the Birds Control Station sets up a special birdnet in Einarstuende, a crazy dose inside the Hornafid Ocean.
Standard markings are provided for those birds coming into the network.
The nets are taken down around May 10, when the casting time begins.
The nets are up all day, at least from about 6: 00 a.m. until noon.
And they need to visit every hour.
The birds that come in are marked, measured, and then released into freedom.
Every hour, a journalist asks the wonder.
“ Yes, we share it with us, me and Geez.
Now that we have to work for ourselves, this can be a significant puzzle, but somehow we manage to do this," says Brännjälr.
Networks are redesigned during the period from 1 August to 10 November — every day that weather permits.
Between watching the nets and the periods that they are not around, the Brenjälfs and Bears are to mark circs, shrubs, and various moths where they reach them.
In addition, they take on specific tasks.
One of these projects is carried out in collaboration with the Icelandic Institute of Natural Sciences, and it is about collecting wild-bird woodmallows.
“ The shoesmith jumps on the birds at their winter stations and then gets a ride with them here to land in the spring.
This happens shortly before they leave, and as a result, these tickles are not large when they arrive in Iceland.
Then he jumps off the bird and tries to find another host when he needs it."
But enough about ticks.
A question of how the birds in Southeastland did it this summer says Brynjälver that the crown’s drop seems to be going well — where it over the head of a beast.
“ The main drop of the prairie here is at Hala in the South, where everything goes well.
But there is no more to be found at Jökulsárlon, where a few years ago there was a huge cast."
He says that a few years ago there were more than a thousand cupcakes, but now they can be counted on the fingers of other hands.
“ When we look at moths and waffles, I feel that it has reduced in the last few years what you find.
But of course there's always a change between years."
According to Brynjälf, what can explain this great change is likely to be about food supply.
“ It’s all about food. ”
In this way, man’s works may also have to say about the offspring of birds and other animals.
Some birds, however, seem to enjoy a great deal of it in the Southeast of the world this summer.
“ One of the things I think positive is that the cows are growing again after a great decline, ” says Brynjälfler, “but in the meantime, the shimmer has fallen a lot in the last few years and decades. ”
Of sparrows, news is that it seems that the mariard is going to go well in his shed for some, like last year.
Forest braids and dumbles had decreased somewhat, but Brynjälfler says it doesn’t show up until in the autumn how this summer turned out to be them.
But let's get back to the crooks.
Often they draw great attention, especially if they are very rare and even colorful.
These two interesting features are one of the most popular features of the summer: Rose Star.
“Otherwise, it’s been relatively quiet during the summer of the tainters, ” says Brynjälfler, but it is noted that in the country there is now a grey line, and then there have been quilts seen and been laid up here.
When Brynjälf and Björn get to the top of the scapegoats, they also mark them, like other birds.
Marks are international, and they are being played worldwide.
There are other things that can be understood, such as where the birds’ winters are, where they are laying, and where their journeys are.
“ It is even possible to see how long they are on a flight, ” says Brynjälfur.
This information is useful in many ways, to form the case of epidemics such as birds.
“ It’s always getting more knowledge. ”
If any outside of the world finds a bird marked by the Southeast Birds Center, the information will be sent to the Icelandic Institute of Natural Sciences.
“ We have recovered from Cape Town in South Africa.
There we found a crimson that we had marked.
One of our crowns was found later in the United States."
One bird is the Brynjälf, especially the mind, and it's the shrine.
“ The bed is our bird, ” he says, and points out that the Birds Inspection Station and the Nature Centres of his Southeastland have the task of observing his outcome — which has become quite a fire, and now he is on the list.
It is difficult to say what caused collapse in the foundation, but one theory is that the shimmer made its way of water, once disposed of by fishing boats and into the sea, is good than the fact that it is now being used much better and that it affects the skating.
Are you in the best place in the country to watch birds?
“ You naturally don’t make me say no, ” says Brynjelf laughing, adding: “Where we’re also chasing birds, we probably have to go abroad. ”
But certainly the Southeast is special when it comes to bird life.
“ This area is like a swung into Europe, but then the birds are scattered from here.
Being here looking at birds and birds is very interesting, but it is less interesting to find them than in many other parts of the country.
It is not far from the fun and to the coal, so that the area such is suitable for observation of birds."
But does Brynjälf have a favorite bird?
He's thinking for a short while before answering.
The question seems difficult.
“ My bird is a child, ” he finally answers, “but I have found nine of the ten who have been seen on the land. ”
“ I now find it most enjoyable to take pictures of the horoscopes.
It's always nice to find birds that haven't been seen before on land or are rare, so I'm not talking about finding a new species for Europe."
But they both did.
If you would like to monitor the work of Bendi and Bjössa at the Southeast of Sweden, you can monitor their work on Facebook and on the Birds website.
Sádi-Arabia — The Sun’s Coast of the Future? No Alcohol or Bikini
The tourism industry has grown enormously in many parts of the world in recent years, and now the authorities of Saudi Arabia want their share of the cake.
Consider the government’s destruction, amounting to some 60,000 billion dollars worth of Icelandic dollars to make a traveler’s paradise in the land.
The Guardian will report this.
But this tourist paradise will not be in the style that we Icelandics are supposed to get used to in southern Europe.
Alcohol will not be available, and women will not be allowed to sung in bikinis.
How, though, is it to attract tourists to this strict Islamic land?
This is to be done, for example, by building a new city that will become white beaches, moons (of course made by humans), dragon cars, and robots serving people.
The Guardian says it's Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who wants to invest in this investment.
Of course, the money will be collected from the country’s oil fields.
The Crown says that it is not a question of women not being able to cover their shoulders and knees in public places, but, at the same time, admits that it is not a simple matter to create a traveler’s paradise in the country because it is too hot when the sun is high and it cannot be trusted in wind shearing.
But you may wonder if it does not also reduce the interest of prospective tourists if they are unable to buy alcohol.
Francois Bozize, previously appointed by the Central African Presidency, reports on the presentation of the President
On Saturday, the former president of the Central African Republic, Francois Bozize, who had been cast by a chair, announced that he would present himself in the presidential elections in December, despite the fact that the United Nations imposed sanctions and that an arrest warrant was issued for his alleged crimes against humanity.
He announced his offer in speaking before a large group of supporters of his group, Kwa na Kwa (“work, work only”), in the capital city of Bangui.
That 73 - year - old army chief and military chief were defeated in 2013 in the rebellion of the Muslim rebels from the north, who plunged the nation, the majority of them to the Christian, into a violent civil war and severe and long - term war.
“The country needs a man with experience, peace and conviction,” said Bozize in a speech that was criticised at the time of the current president, Faustin-Archange Touadera.
Bozize first took office after the reign of 2003 and held the President’s office for 10 years before fleeing the country in 2013.
The new government sought to arrest him for the alleged crimes against mankind and to encourage genocide, but he has not been arrested since his return from exile last year.
It is not clear how the arrest warrant or foreign sanctions affect his or her performance.
In January 2014, Bozize said that he would ask the United Nations to remove the sanctions imposed in 2014 because of alleged support for armed Christian groups of Anti-Balaka.
Touadera operates the country today, with the support of a major UN peacekeeping force that counts more than 13,000 soldiers and police officers.
He was elected in 2016, and he is expected to volunteer for a different period, but his offer has not been confirmed.
The first round of the election will be December 27th.
In February 2019 the government signed a peace arrangement with 14 armed groups, who generally claim to defend the interests of certain communities or religions.
Since then, violent crimes have been reduced, but there are still bloody incidents that are usually caused by resource conflicts, but the majority of this diamond - rich country is not under government control.
The violence has forced more than 1.5 million people to flee their homes.
Gareth Bale’s status at Real Madrid is “unattainable for all,” says Toni Kroos
Toni Kroos, the middle man of Real Madrid, says Gareth Bale's position at the Spanish team is “unobligable to everyone”.
Bale did not participate in any of the last seven games of the team and he took little part in the LaLiga celebration of Los Blancos, and now this summer, he is up to the point that the player intends to stay and let his contract run out, but the partner hopes that he will disappear.
“ There is no way to avoid the situation becoming unacceptable to everyone, ” said Kroos on the Lauschangriff Endlich was my Sports.
“ He wasn’t bought to play as little as he was now.
I think he really wanted to leave the partner last summer and that the partner really said “yes” but then “no” later.
I don't know if he's still a little angry about it.
When asked if the situation had had a negative effect on the Real atmosphere, Kroos said: “Not as much as possible.
I've known him for six years, and we've been doing some very important things together."
Chinese give Reykanestown 2,000 facial mask to support the fight against the crown virus
The Chinese ambassador, Jin Zhijian, handed over two thousand face maskes over the past week to the mayor of Reykjanestown.
The occasion was the visit of the mayor of the Chinese embassy on July 22, last.
News first reported.
The mayor’s visit was to refund the Chinese ambassador’s visit to Reykanesby, where he visited the town hall and met with the mayor.
According to Vikur’s reports, there was a discussion of strengthening a friendly town partnership between Reykanesby and Xianyang City, which began its cooperation between 2014.
The gift, 2,000 facial mines, is due to this community of friends, but the Xianyang authorities wanted to give a mask, thus supporting the fight against the crown virus epidemic.
News reports that the mask will be used in the sensitive institutions and offices of Reykjanesetown for both the employees and other visitors there.
In addition to the flag of Iceland and the People’s Republic of China, the accompanying picture shows an inscription on the face mask box, “Ber is each behind, except for his brother. ”
Thomsen wants to leave KR - Calculates to lower wages
Tobias Thomsen is going to try to get home to Danmerk, from the Icelandic Masters of KR, next month, and says that he feels interested from partners in the Danish 1st Division.
Thomsen has been playing in Iceland since 2017 and has become the Master of Iceland with both Val and KR.
However, this 27 - year - old leader claims to miss Danmerk and wants to move there with his girlfriend, Stephen, Jacob’s daughter.
Danan’s contract with KR applies until the end of this season, so it is clear that a Danish partner would have to negotiate with KR for purchase in August, before the start of a new season in Denmark.
Otherwise Thomsen would have to wait until the winter to get to Danmerk.
“ Yes, I know the Danish branch will start again by the end of August.
It means, of course, that I have to cancel my contract with KR-s, but I've told them that I miss Danmerk, and they have a full understanding of it," said Thomsen to ball.dk.
He added that he had a very good relationship with Rúnar Kristinsson, a coach who had fully understood his position, and Thomsen said that Thomsen did not think that the price would be a big problem.
“ I’ve also had conversations with two of the 1st branch societies after the division was finished, and I knew where they would end.
There has already been some interest in the coming period, so it may well be that I go to Danmerk before the Icelandic branch stops," said Thomsen, but added that there were not many partners in Denmark who could buy up his contract with KR.
“ It’s not quite clear right now, but it’s been interested.
I also need to find the best chance for me and my girlfriend, who is from Iceland and comes with me.
This depends on a few things," said Thomsen, and said, looking first and foremost to the Copenhagen Sea.
Thomsen said KR-tinga doesn't have to worry because he doesn't give himself all in practice and play, although he missed Danmerk.
“ KK knows what it gets from me, and that’s when I do 100 percent.
I can totally overlook the fact that I miss Danmerk when I'm in practice or in games," said Thomsen, who makes it clear that he's going to lower the wages of leaving the Icelandic champions in the next half of Denmark's division.
“ I’m probably going to have to go down a little bit, because of the crown virus crisis that seems to have upset the Danish associates just more than the Icelandic ones.
But I am also studying, and one solution might be that a partner provided me with a job.
Most of the 1st Society’s associates have an agreement with their supporters.
I'm learning sports management through the player organizations and I'm finishing the bachelor degree," said Thomsen.
Thomsen has only been at the start of the KR in two games in the Pepsi Max division during this season, but we've had a story in five games and scored one goal.
He started 21 games before the team last year and scored seven lines.
KR is equal to the score at the top of the Pepsi Max division and is playing for the good, but the team is meeting KA at Akureyri today.
Taking the crown virus on board the bus when the driver gets in a hot fight about the face mask
The video shows passengers and driver on board the Arriva Street Security in Liverpool to deal with mask use.
The driver hears a woman explained that it is not his work to tell passengers to use a mask.
The driver said: “It is not for me to tell everyone who comes up in the wagon using a mask. ”
Regarding the incident, one Witness said: “Man and an older woman began to accept her, and a great argument broke out. ”
“ The driver had to leave his seat and came to ask what was actually going on, and he told one woman that she was not even using the mask correctly. ”
“ Then the woman ran away from the wagon and said she was going to report the incident. ”
A spokesperson Arriva said: “Our customers and our employees are in our first place.
“Our clients are obliged to use masks when using public transport (exceptionalities apply).”
"Scientific instructions and meanings for customers about this, and all other distance rules are on the road, on the public media, and on our website."
Since June 15, there has been a family involvement in public transport.
More than 16.3 cases of COVID-19 have been identified worldwide.
More than 650,000 have died.
More than 9,900,000 people have recovered from the world - wide crown virus.
Most COVID-19 cases have been identified in the United States, or more than 4.3 million.
Octavia Spencer calls for Hollywood to advise people with disability more often in role
The actress is involved in a renewed effort to increase the participation of people with disabilities in the entertainment sector.
The campaign is taking place at the same time as 30 years have passed from the United States’ laws on the rights of people with disability, which are published on Sunday.
In the video, Spencer discusses the importance of seeing ourselves, and his life is truly reflected on the screen.
“ Nothing can replace personal experience and genuine manifestations,” she says.
“ That’s why it’s so important to hire an appropriate actor in an appropriate role. ”
Spencer discussed the effect she was experiencing when she was a little girl watching the feature "Good Times".
The figures shown at CBS between 1974 and 1979 were made by Norman Lear, and they rode the road as the first rubbing of two parents of African origin.
Organization against hunger push Yoho aside after an incident in the House
WASHINGTON (AP) — Regardless of the Christian organization who wants to end hunger, on Saturday they said that they had asked Senator Ted Yoho to resign from the organization, and that he had done so, as they called “an attack” on Senator Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio-Cortez, Congressman Democrata in New York, accused Yoho, the representative of the Republicans of Florida, of using low-level and masculine remorse when he rebuked her when they met the steps of the House last Monday.
Yoho claimed that he had not used the quoted words, but a reporter who witnessed the incident confirmed that the expression had been as she described it.
Bread for the World stated in a statement that on Friday, on Friday, Yoho’s government met with Yoho, seeking that he “explained our commitment to stand with women and skin - black people, domestic and world - wide, who lead us to the world with increased participation of all races and increased justice.”
On the website of Bread for the World, their “co - Christian voice ” pushes the council and the government to end hunger in the country and worldwide.
“ Since Bread for the World is independent of the Christian organization, which aims to reduce hunger and poverty with sound public policies, the organization upholds the dignity, dignity, and concern that Jesus asks us to show when dealing with people in power stations, wherever it is in the political spectrum, ” says the statement.
“ Our opinion reflects recent activities and the words of Senator Ted Yoho reported in the media, not the moral requirements of our government. ”
When the news was processed, Yoho’s spokesman had not answered an e - mail with an invitation to respond.
In an amazing speech in the House last Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez spoke dramaticly from the incident and directed her words against what she called a male-man culture, which “consents violence and violent speech against women.”
More than ten of her fellow workers responded to her statement that the incident was an example of all too common male behavior.
Yoho described the incident as a short discussion of policy and said that “no one had been troubled, thrown into isolation, or attacked. ”
He said that he was sorry for having shown “a hushing attitude. ”
The 30 - year - old Ocasio-Cortez is in her first period as a progressive senator and has received both praise and praise for her clean-up.
The 65 - year - old Yoho is one of the most conservative Congressmen of the Assembly and will sit on a sacred stone after his fourth time.
Wait until 98 minutes in the local clinic to score the first target period
Jesse Lingerd had not scored or posted in the English prime department during this season, until he scored against Leicester today in the 98th minute of the final round of the league.
Lingerd had not scored in the English top-level department since he scored twice against Cardiff in December 2018.
He came in today as a backup for Manchester United when the team met Leicester in the final game of the Championship.
When more than seven minutes had passed, Lingerd raised the ball from Kasper Schmeichel’s goalman Leicester and scored an empty mark.
Jesse Lingard's long line.
Players Real Madrid with the exception of sick leave rules
Zinedine Zidane and his disciples in Real Madrid will be able to come to England in their second game at Manchester City, in the European Union’s Championship, without having to go for two weeks of illness.
The British government has decided that travelers from Spain need to go for two weeks’ sickness, in order to repel the spread of the crown virus.
However, there are exceptions, as in the case of sports competitions at the highest level.
This confirmed Sky Sports sports council.
The Council says that those persons who are excluded from the rules will only be in restricted areas at smelly doors.
This applies to sports stars, judges, trainers, medical teams, and the media.
Madriders can thus meet Manchester City on August 7, without having to stay in England for a long time, but they are 2–1 under the solehold after losing on Santiago Bernabeu on February 26.
The victory team will continue in 8 — a series of conclusions that will take place in Portugal.
The rain of the rains and the rains of the land upon the temple of the merchants
From news of crowded hotels and tents to judge, in the least south, it is clear that the Icelandics have been able to travel abroad this summer.
In addition, if those who have land under foot also had a unique luck with weather and weather - giving DVs, the fact that the summer was just a clean, beautiful one, to at least.
But it is now time for merchants who have so far been the most travel weekend in the year.
However, it is unclear how it will be this year, compared with other weekends, because it is now the case that events that in the usual year have led to a large number of people not being held.
It is enough to give an example of a national festival.
The weather will then, of course, play a major role, but now there is a global rainstorm, but especially south and southwest.
The weather room predicts a rainstorm from Thursday and at least until Saturday night.
It should be noted that long - term predictions are not sacred truth here in the north of the Atlantic Ocean and are likely to make changes.
In his prediction on his weather web, Dr. Einar Sveinbjörnson, the weather scientist, says that the storehouse is expected to be low.
Says he: A low - temperature drop in the attic with its associated cold, which too often also reaches down to the surface, leading to a lower temperature of the southwest.
Of course, warmer air is also “feeling ” north of here.
Einar published his predictions to support her, saying: “A little wave from America travels to the east, and with it a warm air.
As she approaches it, it reaches “blooming” in the form of lowering air pressure and a noticeable summerfall. ”
The great illustration, the European accounts centre to the left of the map, and the American GFS predictions to the right are somewhat consistent with this development.
Understanding the lows, the forecast goes late on Thursday and early Friday with a sharp A-power and rain on most of the land.
The label about 985 hPa is then followed.
After this, there is a rather warm air in the north and east on Saturday, and even on Sunday.
On the other hand, it could blow along.
A man was seriously injured when a car with cattle was selected in Wexford

Follow an actress from Law and Order all the way to New York
“I was shot in it like a kid like this, ” says Birna Hrönnsdóttir about Mariska Hargitay, the major actress of the games Law and Orderer, Special Victims Unit.
She was so runnin' by the actress that she came to the show room and waited for her for hours, just to say hi.
When Birna Hrönnn Björnsdóttir, the owner of the travel agency Pink Iceland, looked like many Icelanders on the excitement show Law and Orderer: Special Victims Unit up from the turn of the century, she looked for the main actress of the games Mariska Hargitay.
Birna tells the story of her meetings and her actress in the show Love stories on Rás 1.
When Birna was a teenager of her own, the age that many start to develop, she didn’t feel like her peers because she was struggling to suppress her own teaching.
She felt that she was interested in boys ’ band and young magical hives from movies, but she did not have it at all.
“ I was cutting pop magazines and hanging pictures on a wall of Backstreet boys and Jared Leto.
But there was nothing behind it, it was just me hiding that I was a lesbian."
She says that sometimes it is said that when people get out of the closet, they go through a late gel.
“ We spend our teens putting these teen impulses, those shots, and stuff down.
I think it was one of the things that drew me to her," says Birna about the actress.
“ And there was something about her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm, and I was just shot at her."
When she was in New York a few years ago, the actress’s string ran out.
One of her best friends, Erling of Ottar Thoroddsen, was shooting a movie in that city and gave Birna and their friend Gunnar Helga Gudionson to help with the shooting.
“ We were working for 30 people and spending a wonderful time with strangers.
It's naturally a deep breath when you spend so long a day together, so it was all talked about and nothing."
One day, Birna is a great fan of Marisk.
One woman on the team tells her friend about the actress because he was on the show.
Birna could not stop thinking about that fact and regularly asks her new friend how her friends like to work with her actress and whether Birna can get to see her.
“ She tells me to stop, she doesn’t know if she can make it happen,” says Birna.
When the film is taken, the group is finally finished, and for the last time, Birna is trying to convince the woman to try to arrange the meeting.
“ She had had a few glasses, and she said she would just cry for it. ”
A few days later, Birna sends a message and asks if something is happening.
The woman does not respond, and Birna decides to give up.
Then, one morning, she wakes up with a long message.
“ I look at the phone and scream over me.
Gunnar Helgi wakes up at the screams, and I say, "I have to take a shower and I have to make myself nice and go down into town."
The woman had then written to Birna that her friend, actors, and the Law and Orders team were supported at a hotel at Times Square.
“ I don’t know when they start or when they stop, but this is the name of the hotel, you will walk well,” says the messages, and Birna will soon get dressed, asking at the reception where the shots are taking place and taking the lift up to the 45th floor, where the group is gathered.
Birna stands by and waits for a woman in her staff to come to her and ask that uninvited woman if she can help.
“ I say I’m looking for Jason and asked the woman to tell him that Birna of Iceland had arrived. ”
When the friend finally comes, he's looking at Birna and asking how she got all the way to the end was to be a strict security guard.
Birna explains that she just took the elevator and asked to see Marisk.
“ Yes, I don’t know.
Sit down here," says the friend and Birna.
Next to her, there's an extra player in the show, and they start talking.
“I say to him, ‘ I am a fan, but you?’ says Birna.
“ I played it as if it were the most normal thing in the world. ”
Time's up and Birna's waiting.
The players appear regularly when a break is made, they talk, and Birna looks around him, looking for Marisk, which is nowhere to be seen.
Finally, the friend comes and tells her that he is leaving.
Birna asks him to get into the hands of another employee because she didn’t think she was going anywhere right away.
Surprisingly, the friend accepts it and reaches another employee.
“ He comes with another friend and says, ‘ This is the woman from Iceland who wants to see Marisk. ’ ”
Then he goes.
Finally, after two hours, the new friend will be running to Birna.
“ He says: ‘ Hurry!
These are unusual situations today, there are reporters with her, so she will not stop.
She's going to go straight to the car with them, so you have to take the chance and go down and find her trailer.
It's white and it's marked.
Hurry up."
“ Then I look to the right and lose my face ” Birna's veins go and take the elevator down to Times Square.
There she finds a forty-wheeled body, some marked, and some not.
However, Marisk’s trailer does not find it, and it is desperate to become engulfed.
“ I’ve been making a mess of it because I’ve spent half a day on it, but think so well, I tried.
That was fun."
vondauf is holding her back toward the hotel, where she sees through the window the recording team looking at her with pity, even knowing that Birna was unable to do his job.
The bees accept fate, and it starts to rain.
“ I go under a cloud to cover up the rain.
Then I look right and lose my face."
None other than Mariska Hargitay stood there in her pantssuit, and Birna knew well — but Birna could hardly move by mental impairment.
“ I look at the body and hands and think now you must move.
Now you must go towards her."
Birna does, and he dares to pick up the shoulder of the actress.
“ She looks at me, and I can hardly say anything.
But I just say hello, "Birna's tearing up.
“ I say I’m from Iceland and a great fan.
She says, "It's great to meet you."
The conversation didn't go much further, because Marisk's car is here and it's whistled at her.
Mariska turns to Birna and says, “I have to go, but it was really nice to meet you. ”
The bees say the idol, look at the car drive away and then break up.
“ I’m calling Erling and Gunna, and they thought it wasn’t possible.
But I was crying out of excitement and joy.
I'll say, "Yes, I'll see her." You'll have to see me now.
Then we made toasts to soda and tequila," says Birna.
Even though she admits that she would probably not repeat the game, she regrets nothing.
“ It’s like this once in a lifetime, to sacrifice such time and energy to act like this.
But I will always be a fan of this woman."
Anna Marsibil Clausn spoke to Birna Hrönnsdóttur in the show Love stories on Rás 1.
Police won't spread the virus
There is no reason to worry that the crown virus can be transmitted by alcohol - readings used by the police.
This is what a police officer in the police traffic department in the capital area says when he talks with Mbl.
Indications have been received from people who are concerned that the same mouthpiece is used for all drivers when the police take up business, get on a roadway, and let anyone who is going to blow.
But the police say that they're safe from cleanliness.
“ It’s not really a special mouthpiece, but we recommend a cup that people blow into," says a policeman.
“ Some people want to pay attention to this, but we guide people to keep a little distance, up to a few dozen centimeters. ”
Asking if it's gone sufficiently, says a policeman.
Try positive, use the police to a different degree.
It has a mouthpiece, which comes from a sealed plastic bag and is used only once.
Abdominal distension: Among other things, an ice can be injected to reduce pain
The relationship with depression is not a coincidence.
Individuals suffering from inflammation of the gut, a disease characterised by abdominal pain, convulsions, bloating, flatulence, constipation and diarrhoea, often experience anxiety and depression, which may lead to worsening of symptoms from the U.S. association of anxiety and depression (ADAA).
“ This is because the colon is partly controlled by the nervous system that responds to stress, ” explains ADAA.
If bloating does not reduce, there may be food intolerance.
Judge tries to stop the decision that children should be released from custody of the immigration authority
In his decision on Saturday, the judge Dolly Gee did not hold a deadline by saying that the U.S. immigration and customs authorities do not have to let children go if it is not possible to do so by any of the three routes described in its previous directive.
However, Gee also stressed in its directive that the immigration and customs authorities still have to discharge their children without undue delay.
The three routes that Gee has taken are to release the families holding the immigration and customs authorities together, to place children in the hands of a responsible person, or to release families under federal jurisdiction.
Shalyn Fluharty, director of the agency Proyecto Dilley, who provides legal services to families, condemned the decision and told her to put it into the hands of the immigration and customs authorities to decide whether to continue to have children.
“The main point I feel is that children are kept in prison temporarily and they don’t escape unless the immigration and customs authorities agree to it or families agree to let themselves stand apart,” said Fluharty.
Families are held in three locations of the immigration and customs authorities in Berks, Pennsylvania, South Texas (Dilley) and Karnes County in Texas.
Children in these places are between 1 and 17 years of age, according to legal counsellors and lawyers.
In June, Gee, who oversees the implementation of the Flores agreement on the care of children in custody, said that since “no masking and social exclusion rules were applied or badly followed”, it is important to move children from these workplaces.
969 people in custody of the immigration and customs authorities have been diagnosed with the crown virus and are in isolation or surveillance as of July 23rd, according to the immigration and customs authorities.
Of these, 25 are confirmed cases in Karnes, one in Dilley, and two in custody centres for families.
A total of over 3700 cases have been confirmed in custody
Will review the laws on government independence
The prime minister does not say that life - giving funds set a standard in their investment policy on the rights of working people.
Notes The Governor of the Bank that the independence of directors of bioethic funds, possibly by law, needs to be taken into consideration.
Thus, after the Icelandas closed talks with Iceland’s airport company and announced to all airmen, VR’s government declared that the directors appointed by VR to run the Lifey Fund for Traders or to vote against the participation of the biogeographical fund in the future Icelanda.
Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, president of VR, later said that the rulers would be replaced if they did not comply with the recommendations.
Ragnar Thorr withdrew his statement three days later and also controlled VR.
Asgeir Jonsson, a cash banker, said on Friday's news that there is a need to ensure the independence of life-saving funds from the approved funds and possible legal change.
The Prime Minister, Katrin Jamesdóttir, says, is important to the independence of the directors of biorean funds, but it is already believed to be guaranteed by law.
“ Now, ” she says, “the Central Bank manager, who, of course, is dealing with the financial supervision that has to do with this, said that there is a need to look at the rules around this independence, and we will, of course, take it into consideration if something needs to go over there.
Katrin says that the laws of life - giving funds set moral standards in their investment policy.
It would be desirable to consider the social and moral standards that they want to emphasise in their investments.
“ I did not consider anything unusual, too, that life - giving funds also set a reference point in their investment policy on the rights of working people.
But I naturally believe that such decisions are made through policies rather than through individual investment decisions," Katrin says.
“Inlerant traffic jams to the Elfusárbru,” says the president of the City of Borg
Helgi S. Haraldsson, the president of the City of Borg, says traffic congestion, which is formed by the Elfusárbru on Selfoss every day completely intolerable.
He hopes that a new bridge on the river will take place in the fall.
Now that the Icelandics are traveling through their country and a great traffic traffic is on the highways of the country, a daily road trip to Ölfusárbru is being made when drivers are on their way to Selfoss or through the community.
Long lines form at the bridge and can take on the patience of drivers waiting in a row.
“ Yes, it’s totally unbearable, it’s one traffic jam here and not just on Fridays, because it’s just been in active days too.
There are long prayers, sometimes quite up to Hellisheði for those who want to get here on their way east to land and those who are coming west, so it gives an eye that we need to get a new bridge and no later than yesterday," says Helgi S. Haraldsson, president of the city of Årborg.
Helgi says that the city’s authorities in Árborg recently had a meeting with the director of the Vegetal Law and the designer of the Vegetal Law, and that meeting was very positive.
“If you’ve ever been optimistic about working in these matters, I think I can say it now because it’s really working in this and we should be able to see that a new bridge is being offered in the fall.”
But is there any advice to those drivers who are in line with the Alfus Rover all day over the summer?
“ Yes, you can go through the brittle and through the Eyarbakka, it is faster than those who are heading east to the town, you cannot tell them to go through the Lyngdalsheiða than those who are going to the uphills should use Mosfellsheiði, Congressfield and Lyngdalsheiði. ”
Helgi S. Haraldsson, president of the City of Burborg, who says the traffic scene, is formed by the Elfusárbru of Selfoss incomparable.
Long waiting takes place each day at Alfusárbru, and drivers often have to wait for considerable time to cross the bridge.
Then the only advice is to take a deep breath and think positively.
The future of the home of the koal bearers in the north of Brisbane will be the subject of organizational judgment.
The city’s government said that as well as the area’s vital home, the koals, the swifs, and the gray gágshauks, it would be an important link between the natural regions of Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek.
It has been called upon by the executives to reject civil governments to the Court of Justice of the Organisation and the Environment with the argument that the structure is in accordance with the law on urban planning from 2014 onwards, would meet organisational and social needs that have not been met to this date and that “good will be done without any unacceptable effect”.
There is a great deal of opposition to these planned projects in the vicinity.
The manufacturers argue that despite the fact that the proposal is fully in line with the organization, it could be changed if it does not meet the requirements rather than reject it.
At present, the project involves many stages, including service stations, childcare facilities, and 39 residential homes.
Officials were more than 120 in consultation, and most of them protested the suggestion because it was too large and inappropriate for the area.
The leader of the minority in Brisbane city said that the city had to buy the land to protect the koala bears.
“[Borger] Adrian Schrener has to stop wasting the funds of taxpayers in the face of the executives and buy this country to protect Brisbane’s natural and animal life,” said Cassidy.
“ It is one of the most important homes of the koala in the natural region of Mountain to Mangroves, where there is a number of koalas. ”
Schrenner said this week that the city’s government wanted the local koal bearers home to be protected.
"We felt the suggestion was not suitable for the area," said Schrinner.
“ I understand that this is now going through the judicial system, and obviously we hope that it will result in a good and positive outcome that will lead to the preservation of the home. ”
Schrenner said that a map on the home of the koala bears was the joint responsibility of the city and government, but that the government was responsible for accurate maps of the local koala bears supported by local authorities when taking applications for implementation.
Sunshine: The next step is to work something
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, coach of Man Utd, was hoping that the team would secure the third place in the first English division today.
The team will therefore play in Europe’s European Championships during the next period.
United needed a tie or victory against Leicester today and was the result of the 2-0 victory of the Devil’s Red Devils.
“ A great achievement for the players to reach a third place, according to the situation in the season.
I think we boys could have overcome a spiritual hole by winning such a big game, where we've lost twice as much as we've seen in this period.
We knew that we needed the finals today, now we can start the next chapter that is with these boys to win titles," said Solskjær.
Manchester United still has the opportunity to win the title during this period, but the team is playing in the European Parliament in August and is as good as 8—a few finals there.
Armaments break begins at midnight in the war-ridden East Ukraine
Kiev, Ukraine — Ukraine’s army and opposition forces in the eastern part of Ukraine are now preparing a “complete” arms break to begin at midnight and as representatives hope to be the first step towards peace after six years of conflict.
On Sunday, opposition officials said that they had instructed their soldiers to break arms and issued a ban order on the use of weapons.
Ukraine’s military forces said that their forces have ‘ made preparations’ for the ceasefire.
If this is achieved, it would “give the way for the execution of other votes” of the Minsk Peace Agreement as declared by the President of Ukraine earlier in the week of the ceasefire.
The objective of the Minsk Peace Agreement, made in 2015, by means of France and Germany, was to resolve the conflicts between Ukraine and the separatists enjoying Russia’s aid, which began in 2014 following the incorporation of Russia into the Crimean regime and its support for its separation.
More than 14,000 people have died in the conflict.
The presidents of Russia and Ukraine welcomed the ceasefire on Sunday and stressed the importance of implementing the agreement reached at the Paris meeting in December.
Mr Putin, President of Russia, expressed concern about Kiev’s call for the Mink Convention to be reviewed and said that the position of Mr Selenski, President of Ukraine, on the “intransigentity of the Minsk Convention, which he again expressed in this telephone call, should be reflected in real actions”.
However, Selensky stressed the need to resort to “several measures” to free those Ukrainians who are prisoners of the rebels in East Ukraine, of the members of Crimea and Russia, as declared by the President’s office.
According to the 2015 agreement, Ukraine can only be given authority over borders with Russia in the areas of separation once they have been granted a wide-ranging right of self - control and when elections have been held in the regions.
The convention reduced conflicts, but Ukrainians and rebels have continued to engage.
When the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris in December to hold other talks, support was given to the Minsk Convention and agreed to restart the peace process.
Selensky, who won the elections in 2019 with promises to end the conflict, wanted Ukraine to have authority over the borders for the first regional elections, but the Kremlin authorities would insist that the agreement be concluded without change.
The new arms union was reached on Wednesday for the support of a three-sided co-operation group, appointed representatives of Russia and Ukraine as well as the European Security and Cooperation Agency, and was therefore welcomed by EU officials.
At the traditional Sunday blessing on the St. Peter’s Square, Pope Frans also mentioned the ceasefire and said that it would be necessary to “rebuild trust and lay the foundation for such a necessary and long - awaited commitment to the people. ”
Police: Man shot to death in protests in Texas
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A man was shot to death in protests in Texas when he approached a car and the driver in the car ran off his weapon, according to the police.
Katrina Ratliff, the police spokeswoman, told the reporters early on Sunday that the shooting had taken place just before 22:00 p.m. at a protest in Austin.
The man was taken to a hospital where he was later ruled out.
The car had whistled, turned down the road and then speeded the journey towards the Protestants, said the witness Michael Capochiano to the newspaper Austin American-Statesman.
According to Capochiano, the man with a rifle approached the vehicle and was shot by the driver.
The driver drove away, said Capochiano.
Ratliff told reporters that the first report indicated that “the victim might have had a rifle ” and added that the suspect was in custody and was willing to cooperate with the police.
According to news reports, the group had gathered for the Black Lives Matter protests on Saturday.
The protests were streamed directly on Facebook, where they could be heard in the windshield of the car and several bullets that were fired.
Markasupa, First Win Blue, July
A short while later, in June 29th, in Pepsi Max division, at Kopavog's field tonight, an IA victory won its first victory.
On the other hand, chessmen lose their third consecutive game in the league.
After winning his first three games in the league, Badblik played five games without celebrating victory and had lost three in a row for the game at the IA tonight.
It was, then, to do or die for Pink, who came with great power into the game.
Alexander Helgi the son of Sigurðard brought the team in the direction of a good deal in 11 minutes after Christ the son of Steindor had sent him through the defense of the IA.
Six minutes later, the Christian then doubled the lead after much legal preparation of the Son of Eyhlf from the left.
In the first half, where high - pressure residents made them difficult to connect, chessers did not reach countries or beaches.
The Bricks had all power on the field, and the third goal was in 36 minutes when Danen Thomas Mikkelsen was injuring the hornwind of the Hökrad of Gunnlalyn.
Then Christ the son of Steindor challenged his second and fourth marks only three minutes later.
The first half, however, did not end there.
In fact, when the Sapphire of Hrafn Haraldsson was cut out of a war stake shortly before a break, Kwame Quee had split the victories of Jonsson within the teg of Bluk.
So 4-1 was the position of Brevel when a half - horn defect occurred.
Only three minutes had passed by a second half when the Skaga were rehearsing.
Then Saevar the son of Jon was alone, unchosen on the market of Pink, and the ball was easily directed on the net by the hornwind of Hrafn the son of Harald.
However, when he broke off Alexander Helga, he was broken within the territory of the IA just three minutes later.
While a vampire was convicted, Thomas Mikkelsen was confidently challenged to cross Brevbliok 5-2 when only seven minutes had passed by a second half.
Five minutes after the end of the Power, Skaga men challenged again.
Anton Ari Einarsson, the goalkeeper of Blok, came under pressure from Viktor Jonsson, gave the ball to Viktor’s leg from where the ball was rejected in the net.
Unimaginable 5-3 positions were observed when less than ten minutes had passed by a second half, which slowed down the goal score thereafter.
In spite of the fine range of both teams to add limits, including two Kwame Quee's death organs from Bretblikk, they did not get any more, and the Bretblis 5-3 win the play.
A bus stop thus won its first victory in a month, from 29 June, and was followed by 14 points in the third place, two points from Val, which is the upper seat, and three from KR's peak.
But KR and Valur both play inside of the Pink.
The IA must accept the third loss in a row in the league, but the team has ten points in the eighth seat, five points from the base.
In spite of the White House’s comments, however, the populace is not at risk
Yesterday, producers of the Wand band were not in a position to stop showing the baby’s substance in the near future.
The statement follows Kayleigh McEnety, a White House media representative, that the elements, including law enforcement dogs, were the victim of “cancel culture”.
Canadian producers were quick to respond to McEnety’s words, and they explained that their fans did not have to worry about the future of the Whella band.
A number of TV companies dealing with police work have recently been deported in the United States following a protesting wave against police violence.
However, despite its expression on the subject of social media, the populace is not included.
At a press conference at the White House on Friday, McEnany said that the President of the United States, Trump, was opposed to “exclusion culture, ” and especially when the police arrived.
The term refers to when a person or a company raises a hard reaction to the public media and is called after the person has been discouraged in protest.
“ We saw a few weeks ago that shows on the WWB, children’s affairs about cops, were stopped.
The same is true of Cops and Live PD," said McEnety on Friday.
Then she added that the Danish toy producer Lego removed a law enforcement set, but no foot is for the claim, according to the defenders Lego.
However, it is true that the realistic features of Cops and Live PD have recently been taken out of the West Sea exhibition.
For example, both participants share a general view of real police work without the permission of people who appear there.
Together for 29 years - sometimes there is jealousy and suspicion
Christian Thomas ’ daughter answers questions about family matters, children, and love in the family section of DV.
This time she answers readers who have never been single.
We've been together since we were 15, we've been together for 29 years, and we have two children.
We know nothing but being together and feeling good, but we both feel like we're missing something.
We have never been with other people and have no comparison of how this could be different.
This has sometimes caused jealousy and distrust as to whether the other person is looking around, is thinking about adultery, or even getting divorced, and is changing.
When we talk about this, we agree to cultivate our relationship, but this is the kind of nightmare that always hangs over us.
Do you have any advice?
Thank you for a great question, and I am so glad that you have open communication so that you can discuss your complex feelings in connection with your relationship.
What would scare me would be if you were thinking about it in either corner, you couldn't talk about it and even take some steps that you might later regret.
Everything on board, isn't it always the best?
Strong self - image has the greatest predictive of future happiness and the stronger you have, the more likely you will be to have a mate with a strong self - image.
Because relationships that start in adolescence not always all their life, often develop in each direction, but in those cases where they become complementary, individuals can become stronger together than many others.
Since your relationship starts to develop in your most educational years, it can be concluded that you have grown together and had a positive influence on each other’s identity.
We are shaped by the relationships we are in.
The way I speak is shaped by how you listen.
The way I show myself depends on how you see me.
Relationships form who we are.
Could you turn the example around and think, ‘ What do we have that others do not have? ’
How does this many years make us feel?
I would say that the costs can be a lot more than the defects.
You've been building each other for years, and for one thing, you can say that you're customized in millimeters.
That's more than many people can say.
Worth it?
You are talking about the fact that you have missed something, but it is important to remind yourself that big changes, such as divorce and new relationships, are also accompanied by followers that you are not necessarily excited about.
You may be missing out on resuming, learning to be alone, getting to know a new person, and putting together families.
This follows new challenges, different problems, and possibly something new and exciting.
But it's not just a pink cloud and happiness, no one, at your age, it can become a fucking complex project, which can probably never beat as well as you've already done each other.
Is it worth it?
Would it not also be advisable to put the focus on what you can do to increase tension, unpredictableness, and innovation in your relationship?
You haven't put a shoe on the shelf yet.
There are so many things you can do to make your long relationship even deeper.
What attempts can you make to do so?
What do you need from your spouse that you are not receiving?
What can you give your mate, whom you have never done before?
You may need to sit down and redefine your relationship.
Would you like to spend more time alone or together?
Would you like to try something new?
Today, there is much more tolerance to various relationships and couples are beginning to define their relationships in various ways, such as open relationships, multiplicity, or to decide to discontinue them temporarily.
I'm not at all telling you what to do, because no expert in your solutions, but possibly it would ease this heavy fabric that is rushing over you, if you look into this and think of solutions.
What do you need so distrust and fear disappear?
You've been together for 29 years, that must mean you're capable of things together.
Use it as strength and hold hands towards your solution.
We invite readers to send their questions and preferences to Kristin by e-mail at: hjonabandsssaela@gmail.com.
The questions will be answered here in the family corner, of course, without names and in full fidelity.
Lost the cup and smashed it
Despite the great experience that Branislav Ivanovic has of lifting bees and celebrating titles, he lost and broke a magnificent prize in joy after becoming a Russian cup master yesterday.
Ivanovic won the number of titles as a player of Chelsea in the years 2008–2017 and then went home to Russia and joined Zenit.
There he has now become the Russian champion two years in a row, and yesterday the cupmaster's title was secured by 1-0 victory in Khimki, where the victory goal came from the warlock of Artem Dzyuba in 84 minutes.
When Ivanovic, leader of Zenit, lost his cup to the ground to break it, as you can see.
Ivanovic and his companions did not give it up and continued their joy until night.
It's a war!
Coleen Rooney talks about Johnny Depp's lawyer at the Wagatha Christie rhyme at Rebecca Vardy.
Coleen Rooney has asked David Sherborne to defend himself against the accusations of injury against Rebekah Vardy.
After discussions between the footballers' spouses went through the gap, their acquaintances expect to do dramatic things.
Coleen Rooney has hired the star lawyer in Johnny Depp's address to defend himself in his so - called “Waga Christie” legal dispute with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday said Rooney ordered David Sherborne to defend herself against the accusation that she had committed injury to Vardy, with claims that personal information was leaked to the media by her closed Instagram access.
A few days after the data were submitted to the Supreme Court, where Rebekah Vardy, married to the leader Jamie Vardy of the Leicester City football team, suffered physically and spiritually from Coleen Rooney’s claims.
The magazine notes that the mother of the five 38 - year - old “was in serious panic attacks and anxiety attacks so that she was afraid to go out of the house ” and that Vardy, who was then seven months pregnant,“ was hospitalized three times... due to an anxiety attack due to the passage and its consequences. ”
In addition to being a lawyer of Depp in his case against The Sun, because of the claims that the actor has beaten his wife, Sherborne, 50 years old, goes with the case of the duke and the duke of Sussex in their private case against Associated Newspapers, the publishers of The Mail on Sunday.
After the two football girls failed, those who are familiar with dramatism are expected to settle in the courtroom.
“ If you thought the Depp trial was a sightplay, don’t underestimate the coming war of football girls,” said one source.
“ Now it’s a real war, and Coleen leaves nothing, not Becky either, and it’s going to be emotional. ”
Coleen Rooney claimed that someone who used the Instagram access Rebecca Vardy had leaked up stories about her for a newspaper.
She was named Wagatha Christie after clarifying how she spent five months gradually limiting the number of friends who could see updates to Instagram stories with her, until only Vardy’s account was left.
Coleen says they put on a story about Instagram, which would then have appeared in a gossip magazine.
In Vardy’s case documents, which refuse to take part, she claims that after Rooney made the accusations “to the upper hand, she was made to cause great damage and severe pain. ”
Coleen’s lawyers have questioned these words, saying that statements about her suffering are just presented to the media and draw attention to the facts.
One source said: “The documents from Becky are misleading, this is all splicing.”
There's a lawyer Paul Lunt at Brabner's Legal Office in Liverpool who's handling Coleen Rooney's case, which has four sons with former England Master Wayne Rooney.
Vardy's at the London Legal Office Kingsley Napley is not sure if she's hired a lawyer yet.
Talker Coleen Rooney refused to interview.
Biden's concert team denies Fox News Sunday for an interview one week after Chris Wallace's interview at Trump
In the interview with Chris Wallace last week, the President of the United States doubted whether the future President of the Democratic Republic, Joe Biden, would deal with the question of Mr. Wallace’s loss of Trump.
We may never get an answer to that question — at least for a moment.
On Sunday, Wallace informed the audience that Biden’s election team had told Fox News that he was “not available” for an interview.
“ In our interview with President Trump last week, he doubted that his Democrat opponent, Joe Biden, would plow in similar situations, ” said Wallace.
“ In the week, Biden’s election team met for an interview, and they said that the former vice president was not available. ”
“ We keep asking each week, ” he added.
Trump's concert team has been working together for months to criticise Biden for avoiding election meetings and press conference while attending interviews during the crown virus epidemic.
Although Biden recently resumed his campaign, Trump and his associates have continued to mock the former vice president for ‘ hiding’ in their home in Delaware.
However, the need for Bidens to attend public events has not been affected by his contributions, since the latest research shows that Biden has a good advantage in Trump both on a national level and in major fighting countries.
Real Clear Police averages indicate that the president was 7 percent lower in Florida, 6.7 percent in Pennsylvania, 8.2 in Michigan, and 6.4 in Wisconsin.
Trump worked in all four states in 2016 when he turned them over to the Republican Party when he won the struggle for the White House.
In the latest Fox News Poll survey, Biden has a head start in Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, in all cases.
Research also suggests that Biden had a small advance in Ohio, North Carolina, and Arizona, three other important struggles in these elections.
And research indicates that the former kingdom of the Republicans, such as Texas and Georgia, was now divided between Trumps and the former vice president.
Presidential elections in which the sitting president offers himself for a second time in the White House are often a vote on that President — and this seems to be the case now in 2020 in the struggle between Trumps and Bidens.
The most important issues have been the crown virus and economics that are in decline because of the epidemic — and the performance and history of the President in both cases.
Kanye West and his mental disorder
Today, the composer Kanye West asked his wife, Kim Kardashian, to apologize for what he had to say.
While the head of the mental health department believes that he is seeking his creative powers, a psychiatrist says that people are taking medicines to keep the disease under control.
The rapper Kanye West is not only one of the most original and most influential musicians in the day, but is not less famous as the husband of the real - life factor star Kim Kardashian.
To a large extent, his personal life has been exposed to open tents.
When he announced earlier in those months that he felt he was offering himself to the president of the United States, he was very attentive.
Later, a few strange hours appeared on Twitter, claiming that his wife was trying to have him hospitalized.
Kim Kardashian later published a statement on Instagram asking people to show their husband and family understanding; he had bipolar disorder, and it would be difficult for a loved one to help him if he did not want to seek help himself.
He has then apologized to her publicly.
This famous family is not alone in dealing with this problem.
It is estimated that about one percent of people have a psychiatric disorder.
Ferdinand Jonsson, head of a mental health team in London, knows the disease well.
“ This disease can cause so much shock for the individuals, especially for the families and their loved ones.
This display of mania can destroy relationships and work and cause uncanny grief.
And then the other side, the depression, it's often very dangerous, because there's a high rate of suicide in that group.
So I thought it was nice that she said that.
And it's just human and human," Ferdinand says.
Unnsteinsson, head of the mental - health program, himself has been dealing with mental - health disorders — a fan of Kanye West: “He seems to have a very daunting imagination.
If we are four strands of earth - bound double bass, he is one hundred cords of heavenly harp.
And he's so unmistakably creative, super powerful, and cleverly in his powerful consensual mind, because you're getting to this consensual idea that we've been able to try to go into a spirit of mania so well know."
Kanye West doesn't want to take drugs, because he thinks they're reducing his creativity.
He's been discussing the psychosis, including the Ye record.
The doctor says it's his choice not to take drugs.
“ Men feel that this creative element involves this unbridled thought and tremendous creative power of the fire that he has, but then natural flaws of it are often great suffering, and elder valleys and dark basements and darkness. ”
However, Ferdinand says it is important to treat people with bipolar disorder.
“ If you have a lot of mania or mania, you’re not making great things, you’re just on the side.
And like when people get into severe depression, people are completely paralysed by that condition," he says.
So you'd advise Kanye West to take a medicine?
“ Finally, ” Ferdinand says.
“ And especially working with someone to find the right doses and this means that there will be a balance between helping him as much as possible and destroying him and his abilities and creative power. ”

"Vengeance" ambassador wants a gun, an armored car, and a stab- vest - said sub-committees to be the ambassador of the "deep state"
Politically appointed ambassador of the United States here on land, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, is said to want to carry guns on in CBS news today.
In the beginning, CBS’s report says: “Despite being located in one of the safest states of the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter is “a “abstainable ” about his security since his arrival in Reykjavikur last year.”
Refers CBS to 12 diplomata, executives, and former representatives, as well as individuals familiar with the case.
Gunter’s conclusion was that they were required by the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs to ask permission for the ambassador’s friendly to go through armed here on land.
He should also have wanted an armored car that traveled with him between Iceland and the pedestal vest.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to express itself as to whether any threat involved the security of the ambassador, but representatives of the U.S. government said that the ambassador was told that Iceland was a safe country and that he was safe here.
Yet, lifeguards had been advertised in Icelandic magazines, says CBS, and if they are involved in meeting the demands of the ambassador.
According to CBS, the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not want to comment on CBS.
On the other hand, the U.S. press office here has said that no petitions have been received by the local governments.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter was spoken of as being armed, where it would insult the land of the land, Iceland.
The Secretary of State had his credit for supporting the election fund of Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential elections.
In the past, he was a dermatologist in California.
Since Gunter took office in Mai, when he said that he has created a “inconvenient” field of service in the embassy, and he has already had seven subs, called Deputy Chief of Mission, substituencies of the ambassador, who are also sent forth diplomatic agents.
Was it all tried diplomates from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
The first was sent away by the ambassador “because he did not like his appearance. ”
If he had already prepared himself for a year, he would have learned Icelandic.
The next one lasts only six months.
After that, the staff was rotated, and it was thought to allow Gunter to look at one of them as most until he saw them.
Furthermore, CBS says that Gunter loved the staff of the embassy to take part in the “deep state ” and buried him against the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Washington D.C.
Officials of the D.C. Department of Foreign Affairs are well aware of the situation in their embassy in Reykjavik, but they have been reluctant to resort to the lack of control of the embassy in view of the connection between Gunter and the White House.
It is also said that Gunter was having trouble following the orders of the State Department in Washington, and he has been said to have refused to return to D.C. while the Covid-19 journey was in motion.
He left the embassy in the hands of his staff for months.
When he is said to have worked from his home in California except by the Foreign Secretary himself, Mike Pompeo, to return.
Deinterlace:
At last the command was received, Gunter returned to Iceland in May.
His new underman, Michelle Yerkin, came to the country this month.
CBS has not received answers to their inquiries to the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not want to communicate with CBS, nor with the inquiry DV.
Gunter is one of the numerous political ambassadors of the Trump government who has noticed unusual behaviors over the past few months.
Woody Johnson, for example, had a hard reaction when it came to the day that he was trying to have a British transfer open the golf championship at the Trump golf field.
The Secretary of State in South Africa has also made an order for running his number two men and then tried to command her son in the job.
42% of the U.S. ambassador is politically appointed.
30% were politically appointed in Obama's government, and 32% in George W. Bush's government.

Poland will report on the European Convention to prevent violence against women
Poland’s regime says that it will withdraw from the European Convention to prevent violence against women.
The Istanbul Agreement is the first binding legal act in the world, which aims to prevent violence against women, but the Polish Minister of Justice, Zbigniew Ziobro, describes the text as “harmful, ” requiring schools to teach children about social backgrounds.
Ziobro said this weekend that on Monday he would begin to prepare the formal procedure for the country to resign from the contract.
“This ideology is linked to attempts to change education in schools and leisure activities, as regards the learning, attitudes and convictions of the Polish young generation, on the basis of the conclusion that our opinion is wrong, that biological sex is old - fashioned and that everything is really about social culture. ”
Ziobro believes that the agreement on the education of children and young people as well as family relationships in the context of LGBT is unacceptable.
“We also reject the LGBT component in the discussion on family relationships, because this is an opinion held by left-wing parties or groups of homosexuals who want their opinions to become binding laws,” he said.
On Sunday, the European Council said that it was “disquieting” about Poland’s being satisfied with the agreement.
In Wasse, on Friday, about 2,000 protests, including groups of women and other groups of rights fighters, outside the offices of the right -wing parties, Ordo Luris, who support the country’s declaration of the agreement.
“We will not be victims, ” they were called.
Conventions also took place in other cities in Poland.
Poland signed the Istanbul Convention to prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence in December 2012 and validated it in 2015.
Maurice Petty, a machinemaker at the House of Honor, died 81 years ago
KANSAS CITY, Kansas (AP) - Maurice Petty, who was part of a quarter - mileage race that counts among other things his father Lee and his brother Richard, and who was the first machinemaker to be taken into the House of Honor Nascar, died on Saturday.
He was 81.
Petty's family didn't give up his cause of death.
His funeral has not been reported.
While his other family members were calmed down for their abilities behind the wheel, Maurice Petty won the nickname “The Master ” for his abilities with the screw-flyer.
He helped his family to win 198 racers and seven titles in NASCAR’s selection department, and he also built machines to secure the honorary partner Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal, and Pete Hamilton’s victory.
“ The manager was one of the most moving mechanics in NASCAR’s history, ” said the director and manager Jim France.
“ He came with the power that helped Petty Enterprises to achieve his superiors in the field of sports.
Although Maurice was known for his work under the hood, he also performed various roles behind the tents and did what was necessary to put his vehicles on the winning track."
Maurice Petty was born on 27 March 1939 in Level Cross, North Carolina.
He followed his father on the race track when he was little and his knowledge of machine engineering soon became a major factor in landing Lee Petty’s victory in 54 races and three championships.
He competed 26 times in the NASCAR book from 1960 to 64 C.E., was seven times in the top five seats, and 16 times in the top 10.
However, he soon decided to focus on what is happening under the hood rather than behind the steering wheel, which proved to be a sign of peace for his older brother, who leaned on his machine during his victory.
Richard, who was then called the King, won the first championship along with the Master's Office in 1964 with the Plymouth Cup.
They won again in 1967, then two consecutive years in 1970 and 1971, reaching three more titles before the end of the eighth decade.
With these seven titles on their back, they rated the greatest number of titles with Dale Earlhardt and Jimmie Johnson.
“ Maurice Petty was one of the true pioneers of NASCAR and was involved in his career at Petty Enterprises in building up one of the peaks in NASCAR, ” said Winston Kelley in a statement.
“ Although Petty is registered as 212, he is entitled to well over 250 victories, if taken with all the machines he built for his competitors.
The chief will be remembered forever as one of the best engineers in NASCAR's history."
Lee Petty died in 2000 and Patricia, Maurice Petty’s wife, died in 2014.
He was also the cousin of the former rider, and the media operator Kyle Petty and Trent Owens, the captain of the truck race.
“ As we now say goodbye to Maurice Petty, one of the true and hardworking pioneers and heroes of NASCAR, his legacy and his name will be stored in our memories, held in the air and preserved for all future time, ” said Kelley.
"We sent our deepest sympathy to the Petty family."

He said that the United States had recently delivered a number of armored cars to Kosovo’s security units.
In a tour of the Serb army tank force, Vucic said that his people cannot compete with “NATO”’s contributions to the arms farms of its neighbours and that “that is why we are up to ourselves.”
Vucic did not specify the kind of Serbian warplanes that were bought, but the media sideways of governments say his government has publicly requested the disposal of 20 attackers from the United States.
According to it, no reply from Washington was received at the Belgrade request and it is likely that an attack plane of the type Sukhoi-25 would be purchased from Russia.
Serbia, which continues to pursue a policy of neutrality in military matters, has recently been provided with advanced air - protection systems from Russia, which have also provided battle jets, attack helicopters, and armored vehicles.
China, also a League nation of Serbia, has supplied the country with the dragons for military use.
U.S. officials have spoken openly about imposing sanctions against Serbia in the event of further arms coming to the country from Moscow, in particular weapons that could jeopardise the security of neighbouring NATO Member States.
In Western and neighboring Serbia, people are watching Russian and Chinese armed forces in Serbia.
The tension is now increasing in the Balkans, where civil war was dependent on civil war in the 1980 ’ s.
The Atlantic League involved Serbia to stop the bloody operations of Serba against the separation of Cosovo-Albana in 1999.
Despite the formal efforts to join the European Union, Serbia's populist presidencies have further strengthened their political and military ties with the Kremlin and Beijing.
Serbia, as well as Russia and China, do not recognize the independence of Cosovo, as the United States and most Western countries have acknowledged.
Heart attack: The likelihood of this fatal condition may be reduced by eating chocolate once a week.
A new study suggests that some kindness may be beneficial to the heart muscle.
What is it, and how could it reduce the risk of heart attack?
Scientists have performed a meta-analysis of coronary heart disease that spans more than five decades.
The main symptoms of coronary heart disease (also referred to as ischaemic heart disease) are three: chest pain (angina), heart attack and heart failure.
Other symptoms may include palpitations and excessive shortness of breath.
“The chocolate contains nutrients that are good for the heart, such as flavoside, methylxantin, polyphenol and stearic acid, which can reduce inflammation and increase high cholesterol.”
Good cholesterol, also called high - density lipoprotein, collects “bad” cholesterol — a type of cholesterol that narrows the arteries of the heart — and carries it into the liver.
The “bad” cholesterol (low levels of lipoprotein) is broken down into the liver and then excreted from the body.
However, the new study does not examine the dose or type of chocolate consumed.
It is not clear whether the participants ate dark chocolate, milk chocolate, or some other chocolate candy.
The results were based on an earlier study which concluded that consumption of cactus (successy) reduced the risk of heart attack.
Scientists believe that flavonoids found in chocolate lower blood pressure and improve vascular function.
The degree of blood supply of oxygen and nutrients across the body and the removal of waste is indicated by the vascular function of the blood.
The results of the new study did not include life-style factors.
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein said about the data that those who had admitted to eat chocolate would be more likely to have a healthy body weight.
She added that they could practice regular exercise and experience less stress.
“ Each of these factors could have an independent impact on the health of the cardiovascular system,” she added.
Coles replaces plastic toys for books in a new collection campaign
“We have really listened, and there was a key point in the preparation of a project, ” said Ronson.
“ We don’t believe that people want to recover the books — we think they will want to have them, but they can recover at home if they want to. ”
Ronson said the new campaign has been under way long before COVID-19 came into existence, and despite the journey, she believes that the timing of the new campaign has been “some good” because of how much time parents now spend with their children.
The reporters have expressed concern that consumers have become tired of the constant toy - collection campaign of the largest supermarkets, but Ronson says no sign of fatigue yet.
“ We haven’t seen anything like this yet, but we keep our eyes open for it all the time,” she said.
“ We report very much data, from week to week, month to month, to make sure that what we give up is consistent with our customers.
It was Cloes who routed the collection campaign such as Little Shop in Australia, the first one in mid-2018 was the drive behind the best year-long sales of the big market from the beginning.
Woolworths followed up with Lion King Oosheis, who also helped the big market to increase its sales, and now lastly offers the environmentally friendly tour of Discovery Garden customers to free plants and flowers for planting.
However, the new collection campaign could have a less impact this time, as the UBS detectors predict increased sales in large markets in Australia on most of the financial year 2021.
Ronson said customers can expect more diverse gathering campaigns in the future and that such campaigns as Little Shop are likely to be less likely.
“ There’s a lot of gathering campaigns around the world that we look at and we’re constantly getting inspiration from other countries,” she said.
“ We need to do this in order to make sure that we do more and better to our customers. ”
You've had 5 laps around the country this summer.
The photographer and material manufacturer Jon Ragnar Jonsson, often known as Jon From Iceland, have been more and less famous in Iceland since the world epidemic.
John completed his research into business science at the University of Reykjavik a few years ago, but he is now working on travelling and manufacturing marketing materials for individuals and businesses.
The summer began early at Joni, or in April, when he went on a journey through the whole of the West province and stayed in his car.
For the past year, he has gone about five or six circles around the country.
Besides, he's been on countless day trips here and there.
What trip has come up?
“ To someone like me who's always on the hook and who's seen everything, it's hard to name a favorite place.
More important is the weather and association.
Recently, after the roads opened in June, they have gone a lot higher than the highlands.
They always stand up because it's so much adventure to get to the destination.
The last trip there is the possible favorite trip of the year, but then we went 25 together in 5 big cars up by River Hill and from there to Lake Elfta."
What's ahead of you this summer?
“ I’ve got a lot of excitement in the coming days, but I was just going to have a suffocation course with DIVE, and I’m going to take down the suffocation trips here and there in Iceland.
Then I was adding surfboards to my “daughter truth ” so I'm going to be more into the sea than before.
I'm going for a 10-day "solo" journey with everything I need to get my back, but it turns out later this summer where I'm going.
Otherwise, I'll be very high in the near future, as it is not possible to look at that area all year."
What place in Iceland is your favorite?
“ It’s always hard to choose one place, but the Jubilee is a part of my life since I remember it.
My family and I went to every summer of our home at the roots of Brevärkjokul, and since then I have always felt good in that area.
I think it's safe to say I've been there over 100 times."
What place in Iceland do you recommend that people visit?
“ I’m going to bring one pearl from each part of the country, which is: a mule in the South, a statue in the East, Aldøøfoss in the North, a redhead in the West, a snowflake in the West, and last but not later,...
What is vital about the journey?
“ I’m not going to land unless I have the following in my car: good flashlight, hanging room, lipapys, hunting knife, arni-cubes, refrigerator boxes, and pets... those who know me know what I’m talking about. ”
Seeking 24 blobs that fear of drowning off an island in Malaysia
KÚALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — The Malaysian authorities said on Sunday that 25 Roharflyers who are afraid of drowning have drowned from a boat off the tourist island of Langkawi, north of Malaysia.
Zawawi Abdullah, a high - ranking official of the Malaysian National Guard, said that the first police report showed that only one of the 25 Rotarys who had run out of the boat had been able to swim ashore.
According to Zawawi, the man who survived sought help from the police late on Saturday.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslim Rohesies have fled Myanmar because of military operations, and many of them live in over full refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Muslims are the majority of the people of Malaysia, who have been the frequent destination of boats that promise refugees better lives in another country.
Zawawi said that two ships and air were used to search.
He said that the field and local authorities in neighboring Thailand are also alert to help with the search.
He gave no further information about the boat.
Last month, the authorities of Malaysia took 269 rowing refugees into custody and found a body on board a boat suspected of being used to smuggle off the coasts of Langkawi, which they decided to have been damaged willingly so that he could not go back to sea.
It was later said that the individuals 269 had been transferred from a larger ship by dozens of people believed to have died and that their bodies had been thrown into the sea.
The prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, said that Malaysia could not accept any more roosters, as it is dealing with the economy of the crown virus epidemic.
He said, however, that those already in the country would not be sent back to sea.
In Malaysia, more than 2 million illegal immigrants live, as well as some 180,000 refugees and asylum seekers — including 101 000 Rohikes — registered at the United Nations International Refugee Organization.
Residents of Aswan collect, watch and return a cargo of chocolate to Sudan after parking
The transfer flight to Sudans with many tons of chocolate selected on the international road between Aswan and Abu Simple on Sunday, at the entrance to the village of Wadi Karkar, when the driver fell into a coma due to a heat stroke.
The inhabitants of the city gathered together to help the driver lay and save the oily goods.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, expressed his position that the driver “was passing through our village; we could not just stand by.
We're supposed to help people in need, no matter where they come from."
He added that the villagers had arrived on an ambulance to pick up the driver and then tried to save the transporter’s cargo — estimated at three million pounds.
Bahr told the villagers that they were in the field from morning to evening and saved as much of the cargo as they could.
“ What was most important to us was saving the driver’s life, protecting the cargo and opening the international road again, ” he said.
The villagers were willing to provide the injured driver with water and shelter, said Bahr, and added that they would just make sure that he could get to and from the village safe.
There was already a fracture on the council, and the crown virus could make them worse.
“ The world epidemic alone is called upon by our elected representatives to take the lead and vision we expect in times of trouble, ” says a report from a series of interviews conducted by Leonard Steinhorn, professor of American University communication literature, and Mark Sobol, author and expert in organizational development and management.
“ But we also face other responsibilities that relate to the inherited sin of our nation and the racial disunity that has plagued our country from its establishment. ”
The study reviews familiarities in relation to the plight of the Parliament: lack of real inter-group relations, agenda limiting communication opportunities, excessive co-communication by leaders, constant demands for funds, differences in inter-group cooperation, the negative impact of the daily media, the fact that the most important elections for congressmen are often provocative and ultimately the silence of minority groups.
Also, there is a warning that the Congress will move more into the network world for the world epidemic, where such a system, which allows elections by local government representatives without the need to travel to Washington, could still increase the problems that exist.
If the idea of a remote conference reaches its feet, it would be a serious setback for attempts to increase inter-class communication, as the report says.
“ Because of the epidemic, the council was forced to transfer most of its activities to the Internet, and we certainly understand why, ” says the report.
“ But even if it was necessary, do not interpret such things as virtue. ”
The document says that the Congress needs “more than less communication between the congressmen, face to face. ”
They need to study each other better, have polite conversations to find common surfaces, and build links based on trust that can lead to increased understanding and solutions."
During the week, especially, when Senator Ted Yoho of the Republican Republicans of Florida attacked Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Congressman of the Democratic Republic of New York, and his companions of the Republican Republic combined to attack Liz Cheney, the representative of the Republican Republicans in Wyoming, with hostile words.
Congressman Val Datings talks about the vice president, telling Trump about it for grace
The Ministerial Val Demings (democrats, Florida) was not shy about discussing her interest in the office of Vice President Joe Biden in the possible government of Joe Biden and expressing sincere gratitude for being taken into consideration for the office.
This respected member of the group of the Blacks was interviewed with BlackPressUSA in direct broadcast for the #FIYAH! Live factor race and told of her history, energy and commitment that has brought her to the place she is today, and began with the words “You all know my story. I grew up as a daughter of a maid and housekeeper in Jacksonville, Florida.”
Damings was one of the four districts of the General Assembly in the trial of Donald Trump in the Senate in January.
Regardless of whether or not the elders ’ department infects Trump, it will be recorded in the history that he is the fourth president indicted.
In an interview with the NPR of his office at Capitol Hill, this former prosecutor of the House of Representatives noted: “Was it worth it?
She added that despite the disappointment of the decision, the democrats had been obliged to follow the case regardless of its outcome.
During the interview, Deings made it clear that she was opposed to Trump’s sentence on Rogers Stone, sentenced for lying before the council (in addition to other crimes) as well as to his pardon for other criminals convicted of similar crimes, when she said: “The lack of courage to reach your friends, those who have lied and cheated to cover your error.”
Deamings is at the top of the Joe Biden list of possible Vice Presidents, who also holds Karen Bass president CBC (democrats, California), Stacey Abrams former Georgia Senators, Kamöla Harris (democrats, California) and Tammy Duckworth (democrats, Illinois), Keisha Lance Bottom mayor of Atlanta, Susan Rice former ambassador of the United States, and some others.
However, she noted that only one person would decide who would take the fall of Joe Biden.
"It's Joe Biden."
Then she moved her hand to her mouth while she laughed and was whispering to the person who looked at the live broadcast and added, “If you want to call... you can do it for me.”
No doubt, regardless of individual political views, this period will be viewed as a time when American politics and attitudes developed.
This didn't happen to Demings.
She pointed out that how many women are involved in making representations to the vice president of the United States is an opportunity to break through the rest of the “glad roof ” — especially for women of African origin.
“ It’s exactly this opportunity that I work so hard my whole life to create for young boys and girls who have heard that their color is wrong, that they don’t have enough money or that they are of the wrong sex,” she said.
The Congressman intended to ensure that the Democratic Group and the election team Biden would advertise and work with Black Press of America to get as many as possible to vote.
“ I will call Tom Perez (President of the Democratic Party Committee) and I will put it at the top of my list,” promised Demings.
She agreed that this would have to happen now rather than later in the campaign.
When she responded to the words of former Foreign Secretary Hillary Clinton that Trump could refuse to leave the White House, he lost his election, and another editorial stating that the president is preparing to reach himself, lived over Demings: “For so much as suggests that he might reach himself let me go. ”
“ But who would ever do it other than Trump?
I think he hates this job.
It should not be possible to get away with breaking the law and ignoring the constitution in this work.
I think he hates the job, but he can't afford to lose.
I can quite believe that the President will not leave the White House, but we have our ways to take care of it, and if that happens, I just want to be with the people who let it happen."

Alibaba and Jack Ma are headed for trial in Gurugram because of the dear former employee
Gurugram, July 26, Sweden: The company Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma, have been entitled to a trial in Gurugram after the company’s former employee claimed that he was responsible for protesting the literature and false reports of the company’s programs.
The case is raised in Gurugram’s district court and the private court judge Sonia Sheokand has published a policy for Alibaba, Jack Ma, and over 10 others, asking them to be courted on July 29, according to news.
The judge has also requested written answers from the company, according to Reuters.
Parmar, who worked at the UC Web office in Gurugram until October 2017, will be presented at 268,000 U.S. dollars in damages according to judicial documents.
“We stand in the company’s commitment to the Indian market and the well - being of its employees, and its policies are in accordance with applicable laws.
We can't express ourselves about the ongoing process," said UC India in a statement.
“ The prosecution also contains “the list of sensitive words” containing passwords in Hindu and English, such as“ India’s border and China” and “the conflict between China and India” that is stated in the document that the UC Web uses to write literature on its systems in India,” says Reuters.
Last month, the Ministry of the Interior banned 59 Chinese mobile phone programs, including UC News and UC Browser, as they increased tension between the two countries.
New York City's agent says it's "fully" okay to exclude a white fireman from a gentleman.
An agent who is involved in the multiplicity of firemen in New York City says that it is “completely” right to keep a white fireman from a gentleman in honor so that flag bearers can all be black, according to a new story.
White fireman Daniel McWilliams has raised a case of racial discrimination after he was taken from a group of flag bearers at the Memorial Mass in November 2017 to commemorate the fallen members of the Vulcan Society, a brotherhood of black firemen.
According to New York Post, the New York State Human Rights Court’s chief fire officer in the field of diversity and accessibility, Cecilia Loving, further defended the decision.
McWilliams is one of the three firefighters of the department who, in a historical picture, are seen lifting the American flag at Ground Zero on the days after the 11th of September attacks.
According to the dear McWilliams, the fire department had chosen him to be one of the flag bearers at the memorial ceremony.
Being a flagrant at this ceremony was “a great privilege and privilege ” for McWilliams, according to CNN’s lawsuit.
However, when he arrived at the ceremony, he was prevented from participating in the honourary of the then president of the Vulcan Society, Regina Wilson, for the claim she had made that all the flag bearers at the Mass would be black.
She then asked McWilliams – 29-year-old employees of fire-fighting New York City – to help in another way."
Among other things, she claimed to have asked him to do is to accompany the civilians and set up typical firemen away from the mess.
McWilliams claims in his lawsuit that he asked Wilson if she was taking him out of the landlord because he was not black.
She confirmed that it was so, he said.
Wilson, who has worked for New York City for 21 years and who also participated in the rescue work on September 11, will have replaced McWilliams with one of the Vulcan’s members.
McWilliams claims that he left the memorial ceremony “to protect himself from further shame, humiliation, and shame, ” as friends and colleagues heard what went down between them, according to New York Daily News.
When a black witness to a court of law was heard by a lawyer named McWilliam, Keith Sullivan, she said: “Though praying for everyone to be black in honor is not discrimination? ”
"No, it isn't," said Love, according to the New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Love if it would be okay to ask for everyone to be black in honorary terms, which she replied, “Absolutely. ”
A promise explained that it would be fine to replace a white person outside of a black person “to raise our uniqueness and different backgrounds in order to create pride, unity, and support for one another. ”
McWilliams first filed a case for racial discrimination at a fire fighter in New York City in January 2018.
He then brought a case against Wilson, the firefighter of New York City, New York City, and unnamed individuals in May 2019.
Sullivan said that after McWilliam presented his charges, Wilson’s supporters had avenged him and threatened him.
At one point, one of her supporters will have laid hands on McWilliams and said: “I have heard about you, they told me that you would behave like this, and now you know who I am.”
In a sport, Sullivan wrote that it would have been “harmful” to exclude McWilliams from the honorary officer at the fair and to indicate that one thing was not true of everyone at the fire.
“ If you’re a black person and you’re different from a white person at work, you’ll get the most reminder, ” said Sullivan.
Wilson, according to the law, received a “advisory advice for one hour” for the treatment of McWilliams.
Meanwhile, a white person who disagrees with a black person will be “a severe punishment, ” wrote Sullivan.
“New York City Firefighting has developed a policy and process to please members of the Vulcan Society, who behave in a racist way, apologize for their actions and help them ... and this has to be stopped,” wrote Sullivan.
Fearing a walking roadman and demanding money
One was arrested in the city after a robbery attempt, threatening a walking roadman and trying to get some money from him.
The man was saved in a prison cell.
At that time the police were informed of a man with a knife in the middle of town.
The knife was set up and reported by the person.
More than eighty cases came into the police force at the capital area from 17 to 05 p.m. and were in the prison cell for six hours this morning.
Police, among other things, stopped a driver of a car who pulled a trailer to Kjalarnesi, where the wheelhouse’s bike equipment was in very bad condition.
The trailer was stationary and intended the owner to provide a transport device to move it to town.
In that case, the police stopped the manufacture of drugs in Farmers.
Two were arrested for the case, and they were released after a report.
Also, there was an announcement of those who fired fireworks in the Farmers.
When police arrived, they had escaped from the scene “probably “the shame of still a considerable length of time at the turn of the year ”!
Thousands of people in Khabarovsk are still demanding Putin's rejection
Thousands of people in the city of Khabarovsk joined the Russian people yesterday and protested the governor of the province of the same district in East Russia and its deployment, which has never lived in the province.
The former governor, Sergei Furgal, used to be very popular and dozens of thousands of citizens protested when arrested and held in Moscow earlier this month, accused of ordering murders in three businessmen 15 years ago.
In a recent week, Furgal was formally put off as governor and his 39 - year - old class brother, Mikhail Degtyarev, appointed in his place, at the small fascination of the locals.
Degtaryev was said to be inexperienced and, worse still, without any connection with Khabarovsk and called the cityrs according to his rejection as soon as possible.
They have called Degtaryev as a wind about the ears.
Yesterday’s protesters were smaller than in the first protests, or fifteen to twenty thousand, and the requirements were the same as before: Furgal’s liberation and the resignation of Mr Putin, President of Russia.
“We want the governor to be released, because we believe that his arrests are very likely to be illegal,” has the AFP news office after a 50 - year - old Protestant, Alina Slepova.
She claims that the Kremlin agents had Furgal arrests “to defend their own interests, not the interests of the province. ”
Despite the clear violation of the rule of law, protesters in Khabarov made it impossible for the protesters to commit a cloudless violation of a convention ban on the Chronavirus epidemic.
In Moscow, however, the police arrested at least ten people who met on the Pushkin Square to show protesters in Khabarov’s work, says the British newspaper Guardian’s report.
The group of Furgals, the Free-Democratic Party of Russia, is a class of hard-line nationalists, and it is considered by political rapporteurs that the Kremlin regime is in the majority of cases.
On the other hand, the same political rapporteurs have informed the BBC that Furgal’s victory in the provinces was two years ago — a great and undisputed attack on Putin and United Russia, and yet it indicates that the Kremlin regime in the East was becoming weak.
Furgal was arrested on July 9, and moved to Moscow, where he awaited the trial.
He is accused of ordering three murders in 2004 and 2005.
Two of them were gone, and the third went out of the threshing floor.
Sarah Rainsford, a BBC reporter in Moscow, says that Furgal’s followers, who enjoy popular homes, are convinced that the charges and arrests are political.
They want to know why governments waited by arresting him until now, says Rainsford, 15 years after his alleged crime.
Three branches gave themselves when the Hurricane Hannah rides over South Texas
The hurricane Hannah fell into the strength of a tropical storm after he hit the coasts of south Texas on Saturday, July 25, but the government warned that the storm could still lead to rapid storms.
The U.S. Weather Service said that the main threat to the south of Texas and the northeastern Gulf of Mexico was as the storm moved west-southwest on Sunday.
Jorge Castillo shared this video on Twitter and told Storyful that he had taken it outside his home in Combes, Texas, on Sunday morning.
Homeless women with disability are involved in the fight against COVID-19 in Chennai
Shanthi, a disabled woman who is educated as a tailor, visits 250 homes every day to detect people with symptoms in Kodambakkam, a large Covid infected area in Chennai, where about 10,000 cases have been detected.
Workday starts early, 7:30, and ends at 4:00.
It measures the temperature of residents, asks for symptoms, and then tells them about the importance of using a mask, washing your hands regularly, and keeping your distance from others.
In fact, her work has led to the detection and treatment of infections in four positive individuals.
Shanthi is one of 16.000 employees of Chennai City who care for their homes, but who are not healthcare professionals.
According to the authorities, the project has contributed to the reduction of positive cases by 50 percent, in the daily count of Chennai, while increasing in other parts of Tamil Nadu.
Shanthi says that not all residents are cooperative.
She adds: “Most people are cooperative when they are approached by a woman with a disability.
Some, though, get irritated.
But this is not to worry about.
I feel that people should be safe.
When I get back the next day, people will be polite.
It helps build a good relationship."
And there are more women like Shanthi who stay in the gristy of the city for women with disability and put the fight against Covid-19.
Not far from Kodambakkam, Kavitha, who is also a disabled person, has also participated in the campaign as an overseer.
Although Kavitha owns a specially designed bicycle, she goes on walking with people and hangs on her chin.
“ I’m happy, ” she says about a reduction in infection, but she adds: “I want them to go down to maybe about 100 a day.
I'm sure we can make it."
At the first floor of the gistyli where the two live are Matilda Funceca, a basketball woman who uses a wheelchair, and Manimekalai, a teacher, and they send all the data that comes from about 40 women into the Chennai-burg web server.
Matilda does not say that she is afraid of being infected by the crown virus.
“ When we help others, God protects us, ” she adds.
When Manimekalai is asked what measures she will take, she says: “I use a mask, I keep a distance, and I often wash my hands.
I also drink Kabasura Kudineer, a sidedha drink that strengthens the immune system."
A few months ago, when the crown virus first came to Chennai, these disabled women spent their time and abilities sewing masks for healthcare professionals in the city.
Dr. Aishwarya Rao and the director of the Gisticyli, as well as the Dorcas Research Centre, who runs the cloud, say: “They adapt to the needs of each hour.
In the past, a mask was needed, and they did not leave behind.
Now it is time for intervention in the community, and they answered the call."
Chronavirus infection in Tamil Nadu has now reached 200,000 after 6989 new cases in the past 24 hours, but it is also the largest number of infections detected in one day, according to official data.
Eighty - nine have died, and 7758 have recovered over the past 24 hours.
The total number of infections in the state is now 206.737.
Police are trying to find out the latest journeys of a teenager in Helensburgh
Investigators who study the death of a youth in Helensburgh are now trying to put together a timeline over his last journeys.
The 19 - year - old Kirk Allan was found in a home in Johnson Court at 6:25 p.m. on Saturday.
On Sunday, a 30 - year - old man was arrested, and the police confirmed that he had now been accused of death.
He'll be in trial at Dumbarton on Monday.
Police chief Steve Martin said: “Our family and friends are with Kirk in these difficult times.
Policemen will continue to work with the community and support it.
Our research continues to focus on getting a full picture of what happened, especially Kirk’s travels in the last days before his death, but we are not looking for anyone else in connection with death."
South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox report their experience of discrimination
The last few weeks have seen that many skeletons are still in the closet in connection with racial rights in South Africa.
A upbuilding conversation needs to take place and action needs to be taken to welcome everyone in sports.
Ashwell Prince, a former cricket star at Proteas, made his white former teammates hear it and accused them of racial prejudice by saying that he and other blacks were “females. ”
Prince said that the black players of Proteas have been publicly named “females ” by their white teammates.
He added that it was sad that even though black players such as Makhaya Ntini and now looking for Rabada, some people still associated with the speech.
Prince, now coach of Cape Cobras team, sent these comments to the United Coalition for Sport and Community Based Organizations (UCSCBO) web meeting on Thursday night.
The aim of the community is to continue the fire - dealing debate on historical racial rights in South Africa’s sports.
“ Just as I said when I let go of social media, it’s not my intention to come and drag people’s names into the stage, but these are real events...
"You're doing everything right, but you're getting infected, too"
Paul Roberts, former musician and carpenter who became a NASA programmer, is now working with software companies.
He and his wife, a former nurse at the Methodist Hospital who looks at himself as an optimistic, held out an amateur magazine online and attended the Comic Con event earlier in years.
Once a week, they're breathing with their two daughters, their sons-in-law and their seven-year-old granddaughter, playing a real Uno game.
“ They are amazing nerds, ” says Roman, 38, about his parents.
Sheryl Roberts, 65 years of age, is aware of the dangers of the pandemic — diabetes, asthma, and heart disease that may put her at increased risk.
Her husband has chronic lung disease and a support device that keeps a previously blocked coronary vein open.
“We’ve been so careful, very careful, and stay away from people, ” said Sheryl Roberts.
Her husband began to work away from home in the spring, when the journey was hard fighting Washington, New York, and other areas around the country.
Paul has occasionally gone to the supermarket at “gamalten time,” and the only real date they had in recent months was said Sheryl when they began to study wildflowers through the car window.
Their younger daughter also took care.
Then came she sneezing home from work one day in the middle of June and thought she was allergic.
Soon she experienced cough, fever, headache and diarrhoea, and lost all sense of taste and smell, which is a typical symptom of the crown virus.
“ She said: “I don’t know what’s going on, Mom, but I had a mask, and I had gloves, and I washed my hands, ” said Sheryl.
"You're doing everything right, but you're getting infected, though."
Elaine Roberts, who was diagnosed with a positiveron virus infection, did not become seriously ill.
However, her parents were much worse off than the situation.
Paul Roberts and his wife began sneezing and then coughing, like their daughter, and got so hot and much pain in the body.
Then he became “very ill, fairly fast, ” said Sheryl Roberts.
On June 22, he was confused.
She carefully checked his oxygen level.
It was low, and she asked their older daughter to take him to an emergency reception, for the second time in two days.
According to a new book, according to the royal couple before, it was found to be "hunded" in the Queen's Christmas talk
MEGHAN Markle and Harry Brettarin felt that his grandmother, Queen Britain, had ignored them in their Christmas talk.
The couple’s new life story, “Finding Freedom, ” shows that they had been overlooked by those in the gallery that saw fit in the Christmas talk.
Images on the desk that the queen was sitting at showed, among other things, the Will of Bretaprin, Kate Middleton, and their three children, Karl Bretaprin, and his wife, Kamilla, as well as Prince Philip.
But Meghan and Harry were not able to see, despite Archie’s birth in May, but the boy was mentioned as her Majesty’s “baby grandchild. ”
The new book, published in August, also states that Meghan and Kate Middleton “had never been friends, ” since they“ had trouble getting across superficial politeness ” and met only a few times.
Yesterday, it was claimed that Harry and William’s brother began a few years before his relationship with Meghan began but that it had reached a peak because of the marriage of William and Kate Middleton.
The Duke of Sussex felt that he was a “darkist” on events with his brother and Kate Middleton, and he claimed that“ he wanted to change things long before Megahan came to history. ”
Congressmen of the Union blame the labor leaders for wanting to keep public workers “in the world forever. ”
Congressmen of the Union blame the labor leader for wanting public workers to become “a world forever, ” after the leaders protested Boris Johnson’s call for people to return to work
Workers ’ officers were accused of wanting to work “at home forever ” after they protested Boris Johnson’s appeal to people to return to work.
Government officials were angry when the civil society of civil servants and civil servants told their social partners to fight when their superiors ordered them to return to their workplaces.
Mr. Andrew Percy, former minister, said that the necessary public service, such as the distribution of passports, was stopped while public workers had worked hard to keep society running in the crown virus epidemic.
“ It is unacceptable that people refuse to return to their jobs while workers in warehouses and factories throughout the country have continued to work so that public workers could eat during this period, ” he said.
“ Many of these employees now want summer vacations, but they cannot do so because of the people who refuse to return to their workplaces, even though they are safe.
Workers' officers cannot maintain this policy of staying at home forever – especially now that we know that people can return to work safely."
Following a call by the prime minister last week, Alex Chisholm, a newly appointed government executive, announced that the agency was to “remain from working in public service at home, and speed up their return to their workplaces until August 1st. ”
The public and public employees ’ working community expressed their societies, which count about 200,000 people, that they would not have to comply with this requirement, and this is about politics.
The spokesperson of the public and public employees ’ union, the largest civil and commercial union in Britain, said that the requirement to return to the workplace was “not provided with the health and safety of our social partners in advance, or to strengthen the economic situation.
This is one way of thinking because of political pressure from Congressmen, who demand that public service be used as an example to get others back to work.
Our advice to the social partners is clear: If you do your work at home and someone in your department asks you to come back to the workplace, do not take that, of course, you have to."
The issue is due to an increasing dissatisfaction with a delayed version of passports because staff work at home, but some 400,000 are now said to be waiting for the extraction of their applications.
The Ministry of the Interior has now published that it will “try to speed up” applications from the British for travel in the next two weeks, and from those who have been waiting for a passport release for more than four weeks.
The public and public labour unions have acknowledged that some have had to wait up to 143 days for passports, but argue that “small and often narrow offices” make 4,000 staff in the passport services difficult to maintain the necessary distance.
The former government minister, David Davis, urged the leaders of labor unions to “take care of themselves ” and seek to cooperate with governments in bringing people back to their workplaces.
He added that if he was in government, he would ask a labor officer: “What do you want, that people stay at home all summer? ”
However, many of the largest companies in Britain have also ignored Johnson’s recommendation to return to work.
A study of larger workplaces with a total of 400,000 employees revealed that only about 40,000 of them have returned to their workplaces.
The emphasis on history can play an important role in the organization
The “gods ” have expanded, but understanding and peace should be the goal.
The education system is partly to blame for this lack of knowledge and understanding.
Too little is taught from a romantic history.
The fact is, without radical action, the only teaching article that specifically deals with our history — “Saga Australia” before the 12th grade — will die out within the next five years or even earlier.
Last year, only 628 students in Victoria completed a study in Australia of a total of 49,324 who completed elementary education, or only 1%.
Over the last six years, these numbers have almost decreased by half, but nearly 100 fewer students have enrolled in the profession each year.
The main reason why so few students choose to learn about Australia’s 12th - grade history is that little has been done in previous years to arouse their interest.
History is not even a unique field of study, but it falls under the broader “intelligent. ”
Therefore, the students finish in the 7th and 8th grade only one brief unit of “nursings and island eggs in Torres Sound and their culture.”
During World Wars 9, 10, there is another unit in Australia.
For many students in Victoria, this is all about Australia’s history during elementary school.
During the 9th and 10th years, there is another optional unity during the period 1750-1918.
It is important to take three measures to save a romantic history in Victorian schools.
First, history has to become an independent subject, such as English, mathematics, and science.
Since history is taught only as a part of thought, it has little room in the curriculum.
It is usually taught by people who have general knowledge but who have not learned history.
History, such as the analysis of data, is complex.
We must employ more specialized historians to ensure that such skills are taught in a accessible and exciting way.
Third, Australia’s history from 1788 to 1914 will become an obligation.
Students appreciate what they know.
So many of my former students chose not to learn Australia’s history in their 12th academic year because they would have had to learn the material from scratch.
Knowledge of history alone does not reveal deep gaps between races.
Without it, however, as clearly indicated in the Victorian study program, the project is hopeless.
Dr. Matthew Bach is the Congressman of Liberals at Victorian State and former assistant director Ivanhoe Girls' Grammar.
Aron Elis in Europe's final game - Isaki split off a field in half
Aaron Eli’s son, the son of Trondard, has come to a final game in the European Union in the Danish competition department in football.
Isaac Bergmann Johannesson played only the first half with the top of Norrköping against the bottom of Falkenberg, Sweden.
Aaron Elis was part of the OB in Denmark when he continued to play a final stage in the European Union’s presidencies.
The OB will meet AGF or FC Köbenhavn in the final game, but that depends on whether the joints end up above the final tour of the top Danish competition department later today.
Aaron Elis played the whole game in 1–1 league at Horsens on the field today, while the OB had won the first game of the team at home, 3–1, and thus won the single hit on a total of 4–2.
Isaac was at the beginning of Norrköping, which was unexpected 2-0 under the first half against the Falkenberg bottom team in the Swedish competition department.
Norrköping made a triple change at the beginning of the second half, and Isaac was one of those who had to depart.
Norrköping was assessed equally, but Falkenberg came for 3–2 in 89 minutes.
Yet there was still time for Norrköping to balance hell at the last minute, 3–3.
Norrköping continues at the top, with 24 points, four points ahead of Elfsborg, and five points ahead of Malmö, which will play for good later today.
It was enough for Falkenberg to get away from the bottom for a while, but the team is a ladder above Helsingborg and Kalmar, who have a good game.
Collections of National Festivals in Crown Virus Times
Anna Lilja Sigurðurdsdóttir founded the Facebook group “My Festival 2020” to gather information about the national festivals that the Eyja people intend to hold for the next weekend.
Many people will tent in their doings, and will rejoice with friends and relatives.
Anna Lilja had a conversation with Hurta on the show Helgin on the Bulb.
“ There’s nothing in there yet that’s very exciting also because there are 600 people in the group, so people are clearly going to do something,” says Anna Lilja.
There's something about the islanders planning to have a tent party at home in their garden.
“ People have talked about being with their own [saint], perhaps camping in the garden and hanging together the family as they always do at that time, ” says Anna.
“ A man assumes that people will spend time with their own people.
However, it is likely that many people will not be there “but to observe some small festival of nations somewhere else. ”
The National Festival Committee is now working hard to refund the tickets purchased, but Anna believes that many locals will rather secure tickets at the next year’s festival.
"They're even investing in the tickets now and being eligible for 2021."
“ I’m a great festival man, I love the preparation and all around it, but sometimes something enters into a life that you don’t control, and then it’s just that way,” says Anna, but, according to one report, people ask if the people of Egypt can’t let go of the festival of nations “at one time. ”
Anna Lilja says that he did not set up the group for himself or to encourage people to hold their own national festivals, but rather to gather information about the festivals of the Kingdom Halls in the islands this year.
“ What did people do in these strange times?
I'm not going to use this in one or something, but then someone who uses this kind of authority in something, but I was just creating some area where people can put in what it's doing."
There is also a fire on the Fjäjstället, which is on fire every year.
“ I think many people are excited to get a burn on Friday night.
The only thing that, of course, makes a mark in the account is that the prediction is no spec."
“ It will be lit in this burning, but it will just have to be revealed how it will be,” says Anna Lilja.
The interview with Anna Lilju can be heard in the player below.
Will Prince Andrew be mentioned in a new document on sexual crime?
The British royal family is now preparing to respond to possible new information in legal documents regarding his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.
A U.S. judge has ordered that secret documents on Epstein and Maxwell be made public
These 80 pages of documents include parts with a witness to Maxwell since 2016
Displaying these pages could also put a great deal of pressure on Prince Andrés, where they find communication between Prince Maxwell and Prince Epstein from January 2015
In 2015, Virginia Roberts, who believed in the sexual slave of the disgraced American financier, claimed in court that she had been forced to have a conversation with Prince Andrew.
Prince Andrés is now preparing to defend himself against the possible publication of information in the week, with even more harmful accusations of his friendship with the child molester Jeffrey Epstein and his supposed wiser, Ghislaine Maxwell.
The U.S. district judge Loretta Preska appointed this week for the publication of 80 secret legal documents relating to Maxwell and Epstein, which count hundreds of pages.
The manifestation of these enormously extensive documents would be a shock to the 58 - year - old Maxwell, where they have much to store with her testimony before lawyers in 2016, including what her lawyers have said were “aggressive questions ” about her sexual history.
They could also put a great deal of pressure on Prince Andrés, where one of the documents contains communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when the Virginia Roberts, who claimed the sexual slave of the reproached American financier, claimed in 2015 that she had three times been forced to have a conversation with Andrew.
Andrew has repeated these claims, and he has repeatedly rejected them.
E-mails from 2015 leaked and the BBC published last year seem to indicate that Andrés asked Maxwell for help in responding to Robert’s claims.
We have no doubt that the duke will be rebellious
There he said to the high - ranking woman: “Let me know when we can talk, and I have some questions I need to ask you about Virginia Roberts. ”
Maxwell replied, “Do you have information?
Last night a source who is close to Andrew said: “The leader of Jorvik has done nothing wrong, so we are not concerned about the opening of a court document.
As courts in the United States have made efforts to point it out, this does not mean that an accusation is true even if it is made in legal documents.
U.S. Courts have encouraged the media and the public to take full care in the treatment of allegations in judicial documents.
We totally agree with that.
We have no doubt that the duke will have a full rebellion in the next few weeks."
Maxwell is now in custody in Manhattan, waiting for trial to find and seduce some of Epstein’s victims who were under law from 1994 to 1997.
It is also accused of a threat to denying the knowledge of a report on his misuse.
She rejects all the accusations.
Maxwell last spoke with lawyers in April and July of 2016 in connection with Robert’s claims of injury, which is now under the surname Giuffre, which she raised after marriage.
Some 40 pages of that witness were made public in the past year, but following the judgment of Judge Presna in New York last week, more parts could be opened first on Thursday.
Lawyers Maxwell received one week to make a appeal.
Epstein was found dead in his prison cell in New York last year when he was courted for sexual abuse.
Inquisition police are looking for criminal gangs for violent attacks on the streets of Edinburgh
Three assaulted a man in Eden, giving him injuries that could be permanent.
The 29 - year - old victim was attacked at Drum Street, Gilmerton, between 23:00 and 23:30 on Saturday.
The Scottish police reported that he had been taken to the royal hospital with a serious injury.
The investigator, Dale Miles, who conducts the investigation, said: “It was a violent and pointless attack. ”
The suspects fled to Newtoft Street.
One of them was thought to be in their 30 ’ s, about 180 cm [180 cm] tall, and heavily grown.
He was short cut and dark haired in a white shirt, dark pants and dark shoes.
A detective named Miles said: “I pray for all those in this area at the time of the attack and saw something suspicious about giving up. ”
The Ambassador wants to carry a gun in Iceland
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, U.S. Secretary of State in Iceland, wants to carry a gun here in the country, and he wants an increase in security.
He is said to have been “become awake ” about his safety since his arrival last year.
This is stated in CBS’ report, which also states that this will be done by Gunter, despite his “one of the safest states in the world. ”
Gunter is said to have asked the U.S. State Department to follow the Icelandic government into carrying a gun.
Then he has asked for an armored car and a vest that protects him from knife tongues.
Although the government has repeatedly announced to Gunter that he is not in danger in Iceland, it is reported by CBS.
According to CBS, Iceland’s Foreign Ministry failed to provide information as to whether a request was received from the United States regarding the possible arms supply of Gunter, because the authorities did not express their opinion on the safety measures taken by foreign ambassadors.
However, the reporters say that no request has been made.
Then CBS will also notice that his sources were told that Gunter should not seek to carry weapons, so it would be taken as insulting here on land.
Gunter, who has been a dermatologist in California for some years, has been an exaggeration.
He is active in the Republican Party of the United States, and he is the prime supporter of President Donald Trump.
He recently drew attention to this country as he focused on “the invisible China Virus. ”
CBS’ sources also say that Gunter was seriously affected by the U.S. embassy in Reykjavik.
He has already had seven second-hand staff in the embassy since May last year.
Among other things, he has accused them of being part of the “Depth ” so - called network of U.S. officials working against Trump, and failed to get a single snow in his office.
The ambassador traveled to Washington DC in February for a conference and refused to return to Iceland for several months, according to CBS’ authority.
Gunter is said to have wanted to work from California, but at last Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, had to order him to return and did so in May.
The world game form is the key to Jose Mourinho, who says Tottenham has a easier game in store for the fans to get back to play.
With Jose Mourinho’s help, Tottenham Hotstöt has not lost a game at home since the opening of the first-class department, but he says that it would be much easier to maintain a good team at home if the audience were to play games.
Question has won 12 victories at home during this season, but lost four times — only one of the six above has lost more at home.
The coach Portuguese said that although such victories were possible without the fans, it would be easier to maintain them if they were there.
“ We have to do this with our fans, ” he said, “and without them we can build up some kind of fortification that is in the foreground of the show. ”
“ But I think it’s much more powerful to do with the fans, because then the emotional side of the game, which only comes with the help of fans at home. ”
Mourinho believes that with stronger competitors, it is increasingly difficult to maintain the long periods of victory on a home ground he knows from Chelsea, or that Liverpool has built up over the past three seasons.
But this is also a key factor in determining whether the teams reach their goals at the end of the period, especially in games and neighboring songs, where the atmosphere of the field can change.
“ I think the policy of the primary department is that now it is more and more difficult to strike this unbridled record because of the good things that have been done.”
“ On the other hand, it’s important to be strong at home, and at the end of the season, it has brought in many ladders with victories in home games. ”
“ I’m happy with the latest home games, without the fans, but we need them back.
I see a victory against Arsenal with the field full of Tottenham fans.
It is a compassion built up gradually."
Purchasers are excited about the pursuit of life-style properties in Lovely Banks
“ Greater is better,” is apparently the motto of new owners of huge real estate in the neighborhood of Lovely Banks, sold recently at $12,70.
Interested buyers looking for a lifestyle near the centre of Geelong moved to look at this 1,35 hectares of land, where 14 cars, swimming pool, and views of Corio fleets can be found.
Joe Grgic, a real estate owner in Harcourts, North Geelong, said that an offer on the property had been approved within 10 days of being placed on the market.
Broome Cottage in Ocean Grove Back to Sale
Home option for isolation
“We received a number of offers from various parties, ” said Grgic.
“ The property was sold to a very excited homeman. ”
The property is accompanied by four rooms on two floors, including a private bathroom that is large enough to accommodate a sofa.
The new owners have a choice of three rooms and can make use of kitchens and update outdoor areas with a view to the pool.
“ It was in how the property was assembled, that she was three widows, and that she was in this place, ” said Grgic.
“ Here came interested merchants from Melbourne who wondered what the property was in the middle, but still with the countryside.
“ I have people who missed out and buyers who are still looking for. ”
He said that the spacious storage area, which includes a double garage and a stand - up cloud of over 10-12 vehicles, was perfect for industrialists or for storing trailer and rearcars.
Is safety threatened in Iceland?
“ Despite being appointed to the most secure country in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been a friend of his safety since his arrival in Reykjavik last year. ”
This is how CBS News will begin a detailed discussion of the US Secretary of Iceland, but it will copy many sources of CBS from the U.S. Foreign Ministry.
The CBS report claims that Gunter wanted a special permission from Icelandic governments to carry firearms to the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
Then he should also have wanted an armored car, as well as an idea of a vest that could protect him from needlestick attacks.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs refused to tell the public whether the security of Gunter is actually threatened in Iceland, but according to information from officials, Gunter has repeatedly been told that he is in no particular danger.
In spite of this, the U.S. Embassy recently announced a full - time lifeguard in Iceland, including in the morning of July 18th, but CBS reports that it is done to delay Gunter’s anxiety.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs does not express any visible safety measures in connection with its embassy, but it always states that the aim is to ensure safety in a preventive manner.
The Council does not answer questions concerning Gunter’s wish to arm and the Icelandic Foreign Ministry does not want to say whether the United States has formally requested the ambassador to carry a gun, nor does it normally express himself on the security of foreign agents.
However, CBS, after his sources in Iceland, has never presented its request, and according to three U.S. officials, Gunter was handed over from these plans, as they could cause insulting to local residents in Iceland.
In addition, CBS discusses the various problems that have been facing the US Embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed as a ambassador last year, but he will already have replaced his deputy seven times.
Thus, the first deputy is said to have been preparing for a long time and learning Icelandic only to have been denied the status at the last moment because Gunter “does not read it” at their first meeting.
His successors have not gone much better under Gunter's control.
Governments in the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs are said to be aware of the position in the Foreign Affairs Council in Iceland, but they are reluctant to intervene in matters closely related to the President.
In addition, Gunter is reluctant to comply with the various regulations of foreign service and respect the order of authority.
Gunter traveled to the United States in February to take part in a conference in Washington, and it is said that he has refused to return to Iceland in the wake of this and has been given his temporary standard for his work for months, and that in the middle of a pandemic.
Will Gunter even have wanted to do his job in a distance, saying that he would not return to Iceland unless the Foreign Minister himself, Mike Pompeo, specifically wanted to do so.
According to the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs, Gunter had decided to take a personal permission at the end of the conference and the crown virus epidemic, but according to CBS’ sources, many within the Ministry will have asked Gunter to return to Iceland, but he had not done so until May, as Pompeo contacted him and asked him to return to Iceland’s embassy.
In addition, CBS discusses the hostile Gunters in Iceland, especially in connection with the timing of which he calls the crown virus the “invisible China Virus” and has received much criticism.
Gunter is one of many, almost less experienced in the field of foreign political service, an ambassador appointed during the reign of Mr. Donald Trump, President of the United States.
Sachs Pilot against Ashok Gehlot; The Bharatiya Janata team says a government crisis in the state; Congress Group wants a vote
Ashok Gehlot said that if this happened, the Congressman would have to pay for a session convention outside the prime minister’s home.
On Saturday, the day after a peaceful protest with Raj Bhawan in Jaipur, Prime Minister of Rajasthan, Ashok Gehlot said that if this took place, Congressmen would have to meet the president and material for a sitting convention outside the home of the prime minister in order to bring the crown into the state.
At the Congress conference, Gehlot indicated that it was planned to hold a vote to check whether the majority of the Congressmen and their joint forces were in the power struggle.
“ He told the government to have a majority and wants to vote, ” says Mahesh Joshi, the major conventioner of Congress, after the meeting.
The assembly was held in a hotel where the congressmen who support Gehlot have stayed in the last days.
“ The Minister asked us to be prepared to stay longer at the hotel.
If necessary, he said, he would meet the President and also give peaceful protests outside the home of the prime minister" said a platoon leader.
The prime minister of Rajasthan can call the Congress together and have the Congress team present to the majority, said the team leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday, and indicated that the Bharatiya Janata team had reached out to overthrow the Ashok Gehlot Government.
“ Land is now governed by law and constitution.
Governments are formed and work with the people’s authority.
It has been discovered that Bharatiya Janata has managed to overthrow the Rajasthan government.
This is insult to 80 million people of Rajasthan.
The chief minister must call the council together for the truth to come before the land," said Gandhi in a hurry on the other side.
Ashok Gehlot, Prime Minister of Rajasthan, told Congressmen on Saturday that he was prepared to go to a meeting of the President of India to ensure that what he calls “Bharatiya Janata’s Council of Ministers” is not successful.
Gehlot, who protested for many hours at the home of Governor Kalrai Mishra on Friday to press for a meeting, met with Congressmen and government on Saturday, and after the meeting, new proposals were made and approved by the government.
Last night Mishra asked Gehlot to re-enter the congressional request and referred to six objections.
The facility will soon be sent to the governor.
Gehlot has accused the governor of delaying before the assembly, where he is “under pressure” to delay the vote on trust in his government.
When Gehlot met his government, Bharatiya Janata, the representative of the leader Satish Poonia and the leader of the government opposition, Gulab Chandra Kataria, met with the governor of the state to discuss the position of COVID-19 in the state.

The actress Spencer Gramr gave a cut outside a restaurant in Manhattan
NEW YORK — Spencer Grammar’s actress said that he was trying to calm the most agitated man when he cut her arm and put her friend in the back outside the restaurant in New York City last Friday.
Gkar, 36, U.S. Weekly, said that she and her friend had done what everyone else had done in the same situation as they were trying to prevent the situation from getting worse when they were attacked.
Grams and her 32-year-old friend saw a snoop at the front desk at The Black Ant in the East Village district of Manhattan at 23:30 p.m.
On Friday, when a man walked up to them and demanded that a sale be made, the restaurant was closed.
Grams and her friend were hurt when they tried to “solve a conflict between an unknown man and other local visitors, ” says the police.
The man ran off the place after hurting the right arm of Grams and stabbed her friend into the creek with an unknown tipwort object, said the police.
Nobody's been arrested.
Grams, who speak for Summer in the “Rick and Morty” and previously played in the series of “Greek” at ABC Family, are the daughter of the “Frasier” star Kelsey Gramer and Doreen Alderman, the actress.
Grams said that both her and her friend expected to recover quickly.
Neither of them suffered serious internal injuries, she said.
In a statement to the US Weekly, Gramra thanked those who responded at the scene and the personnel of the Bellevue Hospital, who were indebted to them and referred to the “incredible struggle” of these staff at the crown virus epidemic.
“ It really touched us to have an opportunity to thank them personally, ” said Gramra.
“ I don’t want to be like McGregor and show my money...
I'm here to help people" – Chimaev after a historic evening at UFC Fight Island – RT Sport News
The battle fighter Khamzat Chimaev from Russia is now named as the next star of the UFC after having signed up in the story of Fight Island, but he says he is not going to flag his fortune in a presumptuous way like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev carried a super team of Rhys McKee, north Irish, in their battles of charities in Abu Dabi on Saturday night when he won his competition when three minutes and nine seconds were passed by the first round of beatings on him in the floor.
The victory recorded the name Chimaev in the UFC history book for the shortest time between victory in the modern history of the race, where only 10 days had passed since he won British John Phillips in a similar manner, then in a vital way.
Chimaev, a winner of the 8-0, received a bonus of 50,000 U.S. dollars for tonight's performance against McKee, and has captured the attention of the MMA world so fully that he is now called “Khalib 2.0”, which may be an inevitable comparison because of the large similarities between the superior Chimaev and the UFC master's lightly and where he is born in Tétenia, which is near to the home of Khabib in Dagestan.
Despite the recent fame and financial benefits, the translator Chimaev has said that he would not be willing to flag his wealth like the MMA Conor McGregor or his peer in the boxing world, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
“ I don’t just do this for me, I do this for everyone I can help.
“ I don’t want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, show my money or something like that.
I want to help people," answered Chimaev when he was asked about the Fight Island how he would use the bonus.
Among other things, he has noticed Conor McGregor’s teammates and the active Twitter user Dillon Danis, who wrote in the community media that he could “easyly” defeat Chimaev by handout.
It did not contain a toxic response from the fighter named “Borz,” or“ wolf ” in his native language, the one who said that he would “paint Danis with his eyes closed. ”
Chimaev, who is now in Stockholm, Sweden, after moving to the country of 19 years of age, may be in a low position to do his financial job, but he is evidently unfailing in his ability to fight.
“ I can paint anyone...
How many fighters are in the charity department?
I can paint them all," he said.
“ Give me 77 kilos of champions (voltively), 84 kilos of champions (mildly), I paint them both that day. ”
Israel continues to protest against the reaction of prime minister to the pandemic
JERUSALEM (AP) — Thousands of Israel protested against the prime minister of many parts of the country on Saturday and was the largest protester outside the official seat of Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
The protests have lasted for a few weeks, but they began because of what critics believe the government is failing to respond to the crown virus epidemic after having initially managed to keep the virus in jeopardy.
Prosecution of Netanyahu by corruption has further encouraged protests.
“ Bibi, go home, ” stood on one of the Protestants.
Another card said: “Everybody sees that the emperor has lost his clothes. ”
Also, hundreds of Protestants gathered outside Netanyahu’s beach house in the wealthy city of Caesarea.
Last week, the police used water guns to disperse groups in Jerusalem.
Following what has been called a rapid and unorganised re-opening of economic life in May, the average number of new cases per day rose by 2000.
The country's economy has been hit by the virus restriction and unemployment has increased by nearly 20%.
The Protestants say that the financial aid provided by the government has little to do with it.
The convention took place in the shadow of the court of corruption charges against Netanyahu, which began again in the month.
The hearings begin in January.
He is accused of fraud, betrayal, and bribery in a series of scandalous matters.
Hundreds of Protestants come together in the centre of Los Angeles to show a consensus with Protestants in Portland
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) – About 300 Protestants met in the centre of Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon to support two - month - old movements in Portland, Oregon, where attention is focused on federal policemen after conflicts with Protestants.
Similar protests took place in many parts of the United States, including Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York.
The conventions in Los Angeles were organized by the Refuse Fascism and Youth Liberation Front groups.
The group walked to Los Angeles headquarters at First Street and Main Street and then to the main city center.
The participants also moved to the Alameda region on highway 101, but later they abandoned it.
Part of the people were seen breaking windows in central - town federal buildings, and false words were written on federal markings.
At least one individual was arrested in protests.
50 people in mosque at Eid Festival and no prayer meetings in Eidgah, say the government of Karnataka
The Eid-ul-Azha festival, or Bakrid, will be held on 31 July and August 1.
The Karnataka government has published that only 50 can come together in the mosque for the sake of Eid-ul-Azha, and has banned prayer meetings in Eidgah and other places for the crown virus epidemic.
Visitors who want to pray in the mosque must wear masks and keep a distance, according to the order from AB Ibrahim, Minister of State for Minority Affairs and Wakf.
The order states that the Hidal Committee decided that the Eid-ul-Azha festival, also called or Bakrid, was held on 31 July in Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Kodama, and on 1 August elsewhere in the country.
It is stated in the order that although prayers are one of the most important rituals of Muslims at the Bakrid festival, such events in Eidgah and other places will be banned because of the COVID-19 epidemic.
However, prayers will be allowed in mosques, given that no more than 50 share in one.
More than the hour of prayer, says the Ministry of Prayer.
No place for prayer meetings, such as meeting places, social centers, or Shadi Mahal, can be seen.
The Karnataka government allows for temples, mosques and other peasants to be opened to those who wish to pray for from 8 June, provided that they are carefully protected by COVID-19.
The U.S. Ambassador wants a armed bodyguard
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, U.S. Secretary of State in Iceland, believes his life is threatened here and wants to carry weapons.
At the beginning of the year 2020, the U.S. Embassy called for the bodyguards in Icelandic newspapers and actually used the English word bodyguard in the advertisement.
According to Burn’s sources, the main reason why these jobs were advertised is that Mr. Jeffrey Ross Gunter believes his life is threatened in Iceland.
A light has been discussed with sources in Iceland and abroad, telling the ambassador that he is in great danger, and that is why he is Jewish.
What the threat is, is not as obvious, but Cildi’s protesters said that Islamic terrorists had been named as a threat.
The CBS radio station discussed the matter on its website this morning, and notes that Gunter is an outrage, insisting on the possession of weapons himself, a stabbing vest, and armed escort, as well as a bullet - resistant car.
According to CBS’ sources, Gunter has been repeatedly stated that there is no threat and that the “bodyguard” advertisement is only to delay Gunter.
According to Cildi’s sources, the situation had not been resolved at the end of June, but the application period ran into February.
According to the U.S. Embassy’s documents, the United States has not been formally informed of these changes.
No formal request has been made for an increase in custody or for the permission to carry out lifeguards outside the embassy walls.
Icelandic law makes it clear that it is not allowed except by a special permission from the Chief of Police.
In fact, Light’s members within the management system say no information is available about any kind of threat.
The latest threat assessment by the Chief of Police is quite crucial to terrorist attacks.
There are no cases of terrorism in Iceland and there is no evidence that terrorists or extreme groups work here.
Forewords to permit the execution of arms by foreign missions in cities and cities in Iceland are not available, according to Cildi’s sources.
Gunter drew considerable attention to this country when he shared the United States President's tithes and called the COVID-19 "The China Virus".
Then he had the American and Icelandic flag.
A Seattle radioman who objected to Trump's protests now claims to have a gun after Starbucks Coffee House underneath his apartment was destroyed — RT USA News
Paul Gallant has taken a new look at violent protests after mocking the President of the United States Donald Trump in June for saying that the Anarchists were burning and robbing Seattle City.
The only thing that had to be let was closer to the home of the factor manager.
“I feel as if I had to buy a gun because this will obviously continue to happen, ” said Gallant on Twitter on Saturday night after he saw that the damaged coats had “drained” the Starbucks Coffee House on the lower floor of his apartment house.
“ Now enough, it looks like a street party down the street from me.
The trade was completely different from when Trump complained about the fact last month that Mayor Seattle was allowing violent Protestants to take over the city.
“ These liberal Democrats are unspeakable, ” said the president.
“ The terrorists burn and rob our cities, and it just feels wonderful, even death. ”
Gallant, a co-leader of the “Danny & Gallant” program at ESPN in Seattle, replied: “Go through there for curiosity last night and didn’t see any burns, robbery or death.
Gallant said last night the police had advised residents to stay away from his apartment building where explosives might be found in the damaged Starbucks-café house.
He published pictures of the damage and said: “Good work, you idiots, ” and stated that he had also seen fire from behind several householders.
“I have no idea what’s going on, but the cat and I are going to find out. ”
The reversal did not overwhelm people who mocked Gallant for his previous opinion and chanted messages such as “Just relax the salmon,” and“ Jah, maybe Trump was right. ”
Jason Rantz, a second radioman in Seattle, said, “Let’s not finally go on this tour we discussed. ”
Gallant went to the joke: “Awake and saw that a lot of people were getting “slowed off the salmon” to me.
He said he was standing by his previous claim, where he had walked through the CHAZ self-government territory of the Anarchist and although it wasn't as bad as it had been declared as.
“ So it was burned and robbed after all, ” he said.
White Lines star Laura Haddock, 34 years old, in an apartment search with her 28-year-old lover, Tom Rhys Harries
Laura Haddock and her boyfriend, Tom Rhys Harries, started together at the reception of the White Lines, who discusses the sigh and the gossip of Ibiza, but in the search for accommodation last week their taste was different and quieter, far from the pleasures of the party island.
The group, which plays a sibling in the Netflix series, was seen looking at a magnificent farmhouse in Oxfordshire, which is for sale at 1.2 million pounds.
They came to the area of Range Rover, which Laura, 34, drove, dressed with galvanized pants and a white body, and found a real estate agency that led them on a tour of the five - room house.
In the last fall of White Lines, Laura played Zoe Walker’s role, a darker side of Ibiza when she investigates the murder of her brother, Alex, who was played by Tom, 28 years old.
Their relationship did not come to light until this month, within the year after the end of the six - year marriage of Laura and Sam Claflin, a well - known Hunger Games movie.
Together, they have four - year - old Pip and Margot, a two - year - old daughter.
When they announced their divorce last August, Claflin, 34, wrote to Instagram: “I have decided to understand legal separation, and we understand in love, friendship, and deep respect each other, and will continue our cooperation in raising our children.
Laura and Sam first met in 2011 in an audition, and Sam, who has also played in Peaky Binders, described their wedding in 2013 as “an unquestionably one of the greatest achievements of my life. ”
Before Laura got her role in White Lines, she had played in the first Inbetweeners movie, and in the crime drama The Capture from the BBC, which was shown last year, where she played lawyer Hannah Roberts.
Tom played a role in the second Inbetweeners film and in the series Brittania from Sky.
Counts too soon to claim another wave here on land
An expert in the field of health care at the surgeon’s hospital says that it is too early to claim the second wave of the epidemic.
Three new inland infections were detected at the National Hospital’s Virological Department yesterday and are sick.
Two internal infections were detected on Thursday, second in a man in his 30 ’ s, and second in a man in his 20 ’ s.
Then nothing had been diagnosed since the beginning of the month.
Yesterday, three more internal infections were detected, one of which had been detected at the Rey Cup soccer club in Lagardal.
In a conversation with a news office, Agent John K. John Jonnsson, says that more people had to take samples because of this infection, but it was originally estimated that.
Another infection is with a person who came to the country from abroad on July 15th.
Then the rules of so - called transit of return had become valid.
Kamilla Rut Sigfusdóttir, an expert in the field of health care at the Agricultural Administration, says, however, that the person followed the old procedure.
His vision was negative at the time of his arrival, but he then became sick, who was in isolation, and has been put into sickness six times.
They're all on their way to a demonstration, but two of them are starting to show symptoms.
The third infection is then linked to the older man who was diagnosed on Thursday and has been associated with twelve.
It has been found that there is a new variant of the crown virus that has not been detected in this country.
“ We don’t know exactly where this virus comes from, but we haven’t seen it before.
Whoever is believed to have carried the virus to the country had been in Israel, but also in other European countries."
She believes that it is too early to claim that the so - called second wave of the epidemic has begun here in the country, just as other European countries are afraid.
“ While the majority is still tracked, it is not puzzling.
But we're on our toes and we're watching, thinking about how to react if something like that might go away."
Megan Fox expresses himself about the relationship
Megan Fox says he found his twin soul in the rapper Machine Gun Kelly.
“ The way I met him, and I looked into his eyes, I knew.
I am interested in constellations, and I immediately knew that my twin soul was talking about," says Fox, 34.
“ A twin soul is when the soul has reached a level sufficient to divide it into two different bodies at the same time, ” stated Fox.
“ So we are two halves of the same soul, I think.
I told him as soon as we met.
I found it right away."
“ After two days of knowledge, I asked him to meet me for lunch, and I taught him about the constellations and asked him into his life.
I decided to go to the depth immediately."
Machine Gun Kelly does the same thing, but they came to know about filming.
“ I had started to hang outside her trailer and hoped to see it.
She has the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen."
Only two months ago Fox left her husband until ten years old, Brian Austin Green.
They have three sons together.
Kanye apologizes to Kim
The U.S. musician, the tiskilo, and Presidential candidate Kanye West have apologized to Kim Kardashian West for a statement that he had officially dropped on family private matters.
“I would like to apologize to my wife Kim for having discussed private matters publicly, ” he wrote in an exchange on Twitter last night.
While their relationship has been seriously outraged, Kanye has recently been a major social media force and a mass meeting that he held last Monday, including the birth of his daughter North West and said that he almost killed her.
Kim then stepped forward on Wednesday and published messages to her followers on Instagram, where she discussed her husband’s illness, which is diagnosed with bipolar disorder (e. Bipolar disorder).
Kardashian West has not before made public comments about her husband’s illness, and that is because of her children and her husband’s right to privacy when he comes to his health.

Increased pressure in protests against racial rights in the United States
In the United States, protesters have walked a number of cities to draw attention to racial rights.
Conventions have been taking place for two months in Portland, Oregon, since May 25, when George Floyd died in the custody of a police officer in Minnesota, Minnesota.
The Trump administration has sent federal police officers to Portland, which means they are still under protest.
Protestants now also object to the federal police in the city.
In Seattle on Saturday, the police used blast bombs and tear gas and arrested 45 people, after protesting in support of protests in Portland.
According to the police, over 20 policemen were injured.
One of them died on Saturday night in Austin, Texas, when a gun was fired into Black Lives Matter.
Media sources say that the man may have walked up to a car armed with a rifle before he was shot.
“The key to this is that it is terrible for someone to die in protests, ” said Steve Adler, Mayor of Austin, in a statement.
Adler claimed to be “harm struck and mouthless.”
In Lousville, Kentucky, a group of armed Protestants demanded justice in Breonna Taylor, a black woman who died in Louisville when police broke into her home, with permission to enter without knocking, and shot her.
Taylor's boyfriend had first shot at the policemen, because he thought they were burglars.
One police officer has been fired because of Taylor's death, but the other police officers have not been charged with it.
The preview of the NFAC team, the armed group of black rebels who have participated in the protests, calls for more transparency in the investigation of Taylor's murder investigation.
According to police reports, three NFAC members were injured on Saturday when fires accidentally ran off a weapon at the rebel army.
Possible infection of the group during sealing
Five have been diagnosed with Covid-19 infection in this week, outside the border area.
Two of them were previously diagnosed with a rare viral variant, and the origin of three of the five infections seems to be completely unclear.
It is uncertain whether the individuals were infected with a tourist who has returned from the land or the asymptomatic Icelandic who had probably more.
A standard pediatrician says that a potential group infection may be associated with one of the infections.
Two were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country last Thursday, with both types of the virus.
The origin of the diseases is still unclear.
Three were then diagnosed with the virus yesterday; one of them has been infected by another of those diagnosed on Thursday, the other came to the country on July 15, probably last, but the third is also infected with unknown origins.
After sequencing of the Icelandic genetic analysis, it was found that the two subjects diagnosed with the virus and associated with the virus have a new variant that has not been detected in this country.
Kamilla Josephsdóttir, an expert in the field of health care at the surgeon and a hospitalist, says that Icelandic genetic analysis is now going over where this type of virus is most likely to have occurred.
“The second case was similar to the virus in Switzerland, but not quite the same.
They're going to look at this and try to map it better, and they're going to like what part of the crime comes from," she says.
"But it seems to be here on the Atlantic."
Thus, the disease is unconnected with the two that started in July and were traced to the United States.
Do you assume that this new species has arrived outside rather than been mutilated here?
“ Yes, that’s different from what’s been found here before,” Kamilla answers, “there’s really no chance that this was something to eat here.
“ These individuals are in any way likely to get close to a person who has just arrived somewhere outside, without knowing it himself. ”
The question is, To date, there is no indication of where these new viruses may have arrived in the country.
“ It could be a traveler who has left the country again, but it could also be someone who doesn’t get any symptoms and doesn’t realize that he has been infected, and then naturally more infection could follow.
We'll be on our toes the next few days to watch it."
“ To date, nothing that is a clear infection has occurred.
But there are people who had a disease in connection with one of the infections last night, who have symptoms and who have been on the show," Kamilla continues.
“ We don’t have their results yet.
So it could possibly be a group infection in the seal."
Do you assume that it is a social infection now?
“ It’s not impossible.
It has not been recently, but it is not impossible because we do not know who has carried this infection in these individuals, who were diagnosed on Tuesday and yesterday."
Would it be possible to speak of a new wave of the virus being started?
“ No, not yet.
Of course, we need to be very alert, and we need to keep that in mind, though there are such limitations as to what we can take a lot of samples from people.
We don't take samples from asymptomatic people, but first we're getting infections that seem to be inconvenient, we need to be given a little freer hands by taking samples from people with symptoms," she says.
In this way, it can be expected that the National Anti-Virus Department of Disease and Virusology will be in the screening in the next few days to try to map the situation here more closely.
Does the Land Hospital have the ability to increase the internal display and take care of the border?
“ Not unlimited, no.
Therefore, there must be some basis for taking samples in people who are not in the screening works; the person must be in an illness and show symptoms or have had symptoms and suspects that they have reached someone who has just arrived in the country or something like that," says Kamilla.
She says that infection is still taking place on the infections identified yesterday and that now much work is being done to obtain information on the travels of individuals.
It says that the origin of internal infections seems to be inconceivable, but it does not rule out the possibility that some of those who have now been hospitalized can provide evidence that will eventually lead to the outbreak of the original infections.
The restaurant that most people don't know about, but I think one of the best
Not all of us are in the clear place where Bjargarsteinn is located, and of course there are more fans abroad than here in the country if the reference to him can be made at TripAdvisor and elsewhere.
People who have flown to the country to visit him have heard of it.
Berglind Hjärsdóttir, food blogger and cooking book author, got to Bjargarstein on the day, and was impressed with water
“ I don’t know where to start, because Bjargarsteinn, the restaurant at Grundarfir, is a wonderful place.
The story of the house is one of the prettiest I know, the food of ten, the view of the worse end and the wonderfully fun servants!" says Berglind.
“ The god, the owner of Bjargarstein, enchanted each animal right to the feet of others before us.
My wife and I, along with our girls, had a whole evening meal, so it must be a matter of how good the food was," adds Berglind.
“ The house in which the restaurant is fired is an old apartment house moved whole to Grundarfjjord.
Now the owners carried away the eyes of this house for sale to Akrares, and found a beautiful sea lot on Grundarphður, and made the dream come true.
You can read more about the history of the house on Bjargarstein's website."
“ The houses and all transfigurations of Bjargarstein are unique.
The household has been gathered together from the entire family, and it certainly has its place in the home.
The upper floor is a living room and is really a place to enter this wonderful restaurant.
The quality and cooking are then not hidden, and it is clear that much is involved in the production of delicious and beautiful restaurants," says Berglind, and the pictures are not to be lied.

Mick Fleetwood praises Peter Green: "His music will live"
Mick Fleetwood praised Peter Green, co - founder Fleetwood Mac, who died at the age of 73.
Green was a founder of this historical rock band along with the aforementioned Mick and Jeremy Spencer.
Despite the fact that Green left the band in 1970 before reaching its peak with records like Rumours, Mick has praised this former band and assured fans that “his music will continue to live. ”
“For me and all the former and current Fleetwood Mac members, it’s losing Peter Green a lot of memory,” said Fleetwood in a conversation with PA.
“ Peter was the man who founded the band Fleetwood Mac along with me, John McVie and Jeremy Spencer.
No one has ever joined Fleetwood Mac without having deep respect for Peter Green and his talents, and the fact that the music should shine brightly and be moved by unfailing passion."
“Peter, I will miss you, but make sure your music will live, ” added the 73 - year - old rock star.
“ I thank you for asking if I wanted to be your drummer all these years ago.
We did well, and we did a really good music course that so many have been given.
“ God be with you, my dear friend... with love and respect, Mick Fleetwood. ”
Green’s death was confirmed in the declaration by the lawyer’s office Swan Turton: “The family of Peter Green reports with great sorrow that Peter died this weekend, peacefully in his sleep.
A further statement will be published in the following days."
Green leaves his daughter, Rosebud Samuel-Greenbaum, who he had with his ex-wife, Jane Samuel.
Green founded Fleetwood Mac with Mick Fleetwood and Jeremy Spencer, but the band was originally called "Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac featuring Jeremy Spencer".
But the singer left the band in 1970, after four albums.
Fleetwood Mac was to be praised and popular worldwide after more were added to the team, including Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks on Rumours and Tusk records.
The land of Prince Jehoakim was said to be constant
Joakim Danaprin, a younger son of Margaret Thorhild of Danadrats and Henry’s name Danaprin, is still in a hospital in Toulouse, France, where he had surgery on his last day because of a blood clot in the brain.
The Danish national radio, DR, notes that the speaker of the Danish shepherd is unaware of the length of the 51 - year - old prince’s stay at the hospital, but his feelings remain.
According to the report DR, the effects of the blood clot on the health of the prince are being investigated.
Peter Qvortrup Geisling, who deals with DR’s health, reports that the consequences of a blood clot in the brain often do not occur until days after surgery.
“ It can range from insignificant symptoms to heroic paralysis, memory problems, or problems with expression, ” says Geisling.
He says that the prince could ask for many months of rehabilitation.
Joakim Danaprin’s full name, Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian, also Count of Monpezat, stayed at the family vineyard, Château de Cayx, South France, when he became ill on Friday evening.
He was first taken to a hospital in Cahor’s town, a dose from the farmyard, but then moved to the university hospital in Toulouse, where he underwent surgery for a blood clot in the brain.
Google Pixel 4 can form the galaxy
A double optic touch enables the Pixel 4 extra lens to be seen in a three-dimensional manner, thereby giving a better tone in the background with a face-to-face setting than in the previous Pixel phone, which trusted the alpha on the software to achieve this so-called "bogeh" effect.
To demonstrate the quality of the camera, Google mythical photographer Annie Leibovitz was raised to discuss his experience with Pixel 4 in the last 12 months.
On-the-flying is still in the foreground of all aspects of a new Google smart phone, and on this phone is a new “computer-driven photography” to improve the HDR+ setting by combining up to nine different images.
New dual lighting controls offer different sliders for brightness and shade and enable users to preview HDR+ in real time.
The phone also leans on motor school to offer a better automatic whitening and to add the Night Sight night setting, which is so sensitive that it can capture the Milky Way in the night sky.
In addition to other camera lines, Pixel 4 Soli presents the phone’s “straight profile” on the front of the phone that identifies Motion Sense motions so that users can release the track, turn off timer, set a wakeup or turn off the phone’s sound by wavering their hand.
All the Motion Sense calculations take place in the device instead of being connected to the Internet and the same applies to the enhanced Google helper, as the technological crisis is now emphasising reducing response times and improving user personal protection.
Continued emphasising Google's full-time hosting capabilities has also resulted in a new voice recording app that directly rewrites audio without sending data to the Internet.
The app is available only in English, but more languages are available.
Pixel 4 will also be the first telephone to support Google Stadia, a game scene in the cloud that will be run off the 19th of November in the United States, but is still reporting the date for Australia.
In addition to new Pixel phone, Google also introduced new Pixelbook Go Chromebook computer and other generation Google Pixel Buds hearing tools.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart earphones, which are expected next year, are completely wireless and have a sound adjuster that listens to the environment and adjusts the sound consistently to the point of clarity.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart earphones are completely wireless and set the volume according to the noise around you.
Google also reported updates of its connected Wi-Fi home bones in the Nest Wi-Fi line with special bones, along with many common basics to improve wireless connections within the home.
The new Wi-Fi system, which will record the Nest name, doubles its predecessor's range and adds built-in audio and speaker to use the Google helper at each home base.
It goes on sale in Australia on November 5 and costs 399 Australians for the bone and one Wi-Fi point or 549 dollars for two Wi-Fi points.
Google Home Mini has also been updated, but a new 79 dollar Nest Mini improves the sound quality by double the bass and has got built-in wall mounting.
All Google speakers will get a new call system feature for communication between devices in the home as well as the ability to call Nest Mini outside the home with the Google Home app.
RECORD: The final day of the first division, Juventus can seal the victory
Here's a list of football in Europe on Sunday:
This is the last day of the season, and there is still much at stake: participation in the Championship and the European Chamber, the last two bottoms, and the prize-grass.
Manchester United, Chelsea and Leicester fight the last two seats in the championship after the Masters of Liverpool and Manchester City, second place.
One point understands the three past, and Leicester receives the United.
Wolverhampton and Tottenam are fighting to join the European Department.
Aston Villa, Watford and Bournemouth want to avoid the two bottom seats that are left next to Norwich, which are already fallen.
When one game is left, Jamie Vardy from Leicester is the goal-highest player with 23 marks, two more than Danny Ings from Southampton and three more than Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Arsenal.
The game of getting to the prime department begins with Swansea receiving Brentford in their first playoff game.
Fulham plays with Cardiff in the other posters that start on Monday.
Leeds and West Bromwich already got out of the next department.
Juventus can beat his own record by getting to the ninth title of Series A, with victory in Sampdoria.
Thus, Bianconeri would be seven points behind Inter Milan, which is in second place when two games are left.
On the other hand, Lecce has to work in Bologna to see further hope of staying away from falling down on a division.
Lecce is four points behind Genoa, which is in the 17th place and is one game ahead.
"Sleeper throw a beer bottle into a harness" in Devon
A pole hunter threw a beer bottle into the market when disrupting the fishing line, according to a charity organization.
Pictures taken at Hope's Nose near Torquay seem to show a man on a rock that throws things towards an animal.
Duncan Kenny, who took the pictures, said the grey seals were hunting when the barmer emptied the bottle and threw it into the back of the animal.
Kenny called it “horrible and careless behavior. ”
He said he was picking up garbage in this beautiful place in Devon's last Sunday morning, along with other people in the Seal Project, when he witnessed the attack.
“ The seller tried to get to the fishing line, ” he said.
“ The hunter stretched the beer, emptied the bottle, and threw it into the bill.
"The bottle landed behind the harness, and he swam away."
“ Fortunately, ” he said, “sold by a strong animal, ” but the seller had simply been doing what was instinctive to him.
“ By throwing a glass bottle into him you’re stopping him on his hunting, ” he said.
The Seal Project Society said that this was “not a unique incident” and that it had recently received“a number of reports of this aggressive behaviour”.
Social Facebook reports that its volunteers collected 12 bags of garbage in the collection at Hope's Nose on Sunday and that “many examples of antisocial behaviour” had been observed.
All sells are protected by the law of protection, and people are asked to stay away from them.
A giant from Kristnapolli, Laxá, Dölum
The first hundredth century was caught in the salmon in the valley of Dolls, late today.
It was the work of Arnor Isfjörðmund, the son of Gudmund.
He had placed in a hoarse position in a Christian pole this morning and was 89 inches [89 cm].
After lunch, he had a chance at a Christian pole, and he thought of a story that he had heard about the slow that he would like to see after the hoarse catch.
With this in mind, he went with Collie Dog king and threw over Christian pole.
Soon he was taken and as he himself tells.
“ After so five seconds, he cleaned himself completely, and I realized that this was the score.
I got nervous, where I had eleven pounds of money.
I usually caught fish, but I had it with me for 40 minutes.
In fact, he was quite comfortable.
Took a few trips up and down the puddle, but then I got to strand him and it was a great feeling.
Squeaked away my pole and jumped at him.
He measured 102 centimeters, and I disputed him," said a merry hunter in the hunting house A guild in the salmon in the valleys in a conversation with Scorpios.
Arnór is as no beginner when it comes to hundreds.
That was his eighth.
He had such fish in the country, the Black Sea, the Red Sea, the Red Sea, the Red Sea, two in the Valley of Langadal, and one in the Far East.
According to Arnor, a fine fishing trip is in Laxá, Dölum.
The hole that ends at noon tomorrow is brought 35 salmon and our man has eighteen of them.
Expecting Great Floods for Hannah
Hannah, first a hurricane of the Atlantic this year, landed in Texas, U.S.A., last night.
Hannah soon lost power and, in spite of this, had a great deal of rain in the area and was expected to flood a great deal.
Up to 30 centimeters of rain are expected in one day, but in special places it could reach up to 46 centimeters, according to AP News.
Especially is it warned that the rain could result from a major threat of sudden floods.
Because of the great distribution of the new crown virus there, Hannah’s land area has been hit.
In addition, seas have gone ashore and have been damaged.
There are now at least 43,700 people without electricity and have been opened to the area by mass help stations.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, spoke about the hurricane last night and said that it was important for people to listen to experts and follow instructions.
Below you can see the footage that the filmmaker AP captured this morning.
Houses burned, shops robbed, and internal damage
More than sixty are dead and sixty more wounded after attack in the village of Master in the Darfur district of Sudan yesterday.
The attack “was the most recent serious security incident in the last weeks in which houses were burned, shopped and placed on the market were robbed and damaged, ” says a statement from the United Nations Human Rights Office in the capital city of Kartum, published today.
Abdalla Hamdok, prime minister of Sudan, has announced that security forces will be sent to the country’s war battle battle to “protect the inhabitants and the harvests. ”
Only two days ago an unknown army in the area killed at least 20 civilians, including children, in another attack.
“The rise of violence in different parts of the Darfur region is leading to an increase in the climate, endangering agriculture and threatening lives and people's living bread,” says the United Nations.
The conflict in Darfur, in the west of Sudan, began in 2003 when most Arab rebels rose against the governor of Kartum.
The forces of governments and Arab armies who tried to cut the rebellion have been accused of widespread brutality, while some 300,000 were killed in the fighting, as determined by the United Nations.
Omas al-Bashir, who was cast by a chair as the leader of Sudan, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, genocide, and crime against humanity in Darfur.
Meanwhile, a new government in Sudan is now trying to negotiate peace with major rebel groups.
A TV reporter thanks an audience for taking note of cancer
TAMPA, Florida (AP) — A broadcaster in Florida thanks the audience’s attentioners for having noticed her neck nod and sent her e - mail that she should have him checked.
Victoria Price, a reporter of WFLA, Tampa, took this advice and became diagnosed with cancer.
Price on Twitter said she had surgery on Monday to remove the tumour, the thyroid, and some lymph nodes.
“ The doctor said it was spreading, but not too much, and we hope that this will be my first and last operation, ” she said.
The audience sent Price e - mail last month and said that the knot reminded her of the knot she had had.
A 28 - year - old researcher, Price, said this week that her television station’s slogans were “8 on your side. ”
“ But the role changed recently when an observer was involved with ME, and I couldn’t be more grateful, ” said Price.
“ I will be forever grateful to the woman who tried to send me an e - mail, completely stranger.
She had no obligation to do so, but she did.

Two were bitten by coyotes near the Oso Creek route on the Jeronimo Road in Mission Viejo on Saturday morning and finally the route was temporary.
Laura Wittmer claims to see the coyote almost every morning and usually she tries to avoid them just, but on Saturday morning one came straight to her and bit her leg.
The route has been closed during the investigation.
“ Today, ” said Mission Viejo, “two different parties announced that coyotes had bitten a human being. Mission Viejo’s animal welfare service is working in collaboration with the division of fish and animal life, and part of Jeronimo Open Space has been closed.
Wittmer tried to beat off the coyote with a bottle of water.
She called the emergency line to get a ride to her car, but she could drive on emergency reception herself.
The coyote disappeared in the barns, but public workers hope to be able to fire it and test it for rabies.
Wittmer is treated for rabies as a precautionary measure for the next two weeks.
She said that this terrible incident would not keep her away from the morning races, but that from now on she would choose another place.
The person being bitten’s condition is not clear.
The protesters of racial hatred are in line with the Seattle police.
In Seattle on Sunday, between police and Protestants against racial hatred, many people were arrested, but the public was dissatisfied because of Donald Trump’s plans to send a number of federal police officers into major cities.
Objections against racial hatred and police violence have begun following the death of an unarmed George Floyd, in Minneapolis, May.
On Saturday’s Saturday morning, protesters in Seattle cut off wheelchairs and broke windows in wheelchairs, causing the police to declare an unsightly state and empty the streets with pepper sprays and blast bombs.
In addition, Protestants lit wheelchairs on construction grounds for a possible juvenile prison.
The police said they arrested 45 people, but 21 policemen had been injured.
The convention was held in support of the protests in the neighbouring city of Portland, Oregon.
Portland is on the scene after Trump ordered a very controversial operation by federal police officers, in the unthankful of local authorities, who say the police have overpowered power.
Conventions have been held in Austin, Texas, as well as Louisville, Kentucky, New York, Omaha, Nebraska, Oakland, and Los Angeles, California, and Richmond, Virginia.
In Austin, the capital of Texas, one was shot to death in armed battles in central prayer on Saturday night, according to the police.
Together with the protests, Trump is increasingly challenging to re-elect in November and has adopted a tough law enforcement policy.
