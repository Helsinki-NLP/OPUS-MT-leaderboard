“ Looking like a fool ” is a worry of good stewards.
Some councillors have suggested that their title be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Council).
Concerns have been raised on the basis of a plan to change the Council’s name to the council’s best interests.
Government officials from all quarters are concerned that they could be ridiculed.
One officer from the labor group said that his team was worried that “it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers who live outside Wales: in prosperity, twp means stupid and pwp means dung.
An official from the Plaid Cymra group said that the whole class was “dissatisfied ” and made other suggestions.
An official from the welfare team said that his group had “open mind” about the change of name, but pointed out that there was no great difference between the word MWP and Muppet (flon).
In this context, it can be said that the German letter w is presented in the same way as u in Icelandic.
Of course, the counsel that now works on a bill to present the name changes said: “The rule of law of all names given to the members of the council will lie with the members themselves. ”
The Wales Government Act (The Government of Wales Act 2017) empowered the Welfare Council to change its name.
In June, the Council published the results of a public opinion poll that showed strong support for calling the Council the Good Congress.
With regard to the title of the council, the WMP (Welsh Parliament Members, successful members of the council) selected the most public support in the surveys.
According to news, there are other suggestions now made by stewards, but it may be difficult to reach an agreement for the president of the council, Elin Jones, who will present a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform report will also include other changes in the way the Council works, including the rules on the disengagement of councillors and the organisation of the Committee system.
At the beginning of the discussion on the bill, officials will be able to give final votes on their behalf.
The Macedonian people vote in elections for a change of name in the country
The voters will vote on Sunday to change their country’s name to the “Nordic Republic of Macedonia”.
This issue was put to the vote in an attempt to resolve a decade - long dispute with the neighbouring Greek country, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Atenu City has long argued that the name of their neighbours in the north is equivalent to the claim in its territory and has often protested against their applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the change of name, has said that he will not regard the elections as valid.
However, supporters of the votes, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have said that the name change is simply the price that needs to be paid for membership of the EU and NATO.
The church bells of St Martin sound are the churches of Harlem in trouble
“ The older people I have talked to said that earlier there was a bar and church in every corner of the street, ” said Mr. Adams.
“ Today there is neither one to find. ”
He said that it is understandable that the burden is decreasing.
“People have other ways to meet,” he said.
“Children are no longer centres of the neighborhood where people gather regularly. ”
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned about the fact that the money that leaves property will not only last as long as the leaders expect “and sooner or later they will return to the first place. ”
He added that there might be churches being replaced by residential homes filled with people who will not help save the nearby locations of refuge.
“ The vast majority of people who buy camps in these buildings become white, ” he said, “and, as a result, will speed up the permanent closure of these churches, since it is unlikely that most people who move into these apartments will be members of these churches. ”
Both churches were built of white congregations before Harlem became the center of the Black Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin’s Church a decade later.
In the 1930 ’ s, the original white Methodist congregation moved away.
The nearby congregation of blacks took over the building.
The Watch Tower Society took over St. Martin’s Church, under the direction of Father John Howard Johnson, who took the initiative to skew merchants on 125th Street, Harlem’s main trading street, who wanted to recruit or increase the position of black workers.
The building was seriously damaged by fire in 1939, but members of the Father’s congregation planned to rebuild it, and they also had it built.
Father David Johnson, son and successor Johnson, proudly called the clock game “the clocks of the poor people. ”
The expert who played the game of clocks in July called it another name: “A cultural treasure” and“ A unique historical musical instrument. ”
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first ball game in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved over to a bigger ball game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin didn't get anyone else in his place.
Over the past few months, many architects and contractors have made their way to St. Martin, some of whom have been hired by church leaders and other bishops.
The Church Council, which oversees the application and is appointed as church leaders, wrote the Episcopal Church in July and expressed its concern that the bishopial Church “would seek to pass the cost on to” the Church, even if it had not been involved in the recruitment of the architects and the undertakings sent by the bishops.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishopial district.
A shark hurt a 13-year-old boy who suffocated a lobster in California
According to the authorities, a shark attacked a 13 - year - old boy and injured him on Saturday when the boy was diving for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster fishing season.
The attack took place just before seven o’clock in the morning near the Beacon’s Beach beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the kid in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help and then riding over a group of others to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that he had at first thought that this was only a strain on having reached a lobster, but then “beheld that the boy cried out, ” he said,“ I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
His entire attachment was torn up," Hammel said about what he saw when he came to the boy.
“ I cried out of the water, ‘ There is a shark in the water.’ He added.
The boy was taken by a helicopter to the Rady Barnas Hospital in San Diego, where he is seriously injured.
The type of shark attacking the boy is unknown.
The captain of the Coast Guards, Larry Giles, said at a media conference that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but he was not of a dangerous type of sharks.
Giles added that the victim was severely injured in the upper body.
The authorities closed beach access from the Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to the Swami’s beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, in study and safety.
Giles said that more than 135 different sharks were in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plan to get a grip on Britain’s cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s is going to eat a race at Boots, SuperDrug, and Debenhams with a neat product shelf in a shopping mall style and with specialized assistants.
This is part of a plan to enter Britain's industrialised product market, worth £2.8 billion, and is growing as sales in fashion and home products are declining. If you are successful, the larger retail goods shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be put into more stores next year.
Investment in tailors is part of a large - scale market to use a hiccups that were once new to televisions, microwaves, and home destinations.
Sainsbury’s claim is to double his choice of products for up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Today’s products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also receive an increased space with marked areas similar to those found in shops such as Boots.
The store is also about to resume the sale of its Boutique product selection so that the majority of the goods are road-friendly, while younger consumers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will test goods in two Sainsbury’s shops, the first opened up in Croydon in South London last week, and the next one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
The online store and the increased tendency of consumers to buy small amounts of food every day in neighborhood stores mean that larger markets need to be more involved in getting people to come to their homes.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury’s business, said that the shops would be more and more like shopping malls when the store industry tries to fight the low-cost stores of Aldi and Lidl with more services and products than food.
Sainsbury’s has placed Argo’s camp in hundreds of stores and has also introduced to the history of a number of Habitat camp since both chains were bought two years ago.
The first attempt of the store to revitalize its medical and medical units was not successful.
Sainsbury‘s tried to cooperate with Boots around the year 2000, but it ended due to a dispute as to how to share the proceeds of drug sales in the supermarket.
The new policy follows that Sainsbury’s sale of its 281 drug products to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyd’s pharmaceutical products markets, was at GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to the policy, Lloyds will play a role in these plans by adding a large selection of luxury skin labels, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, marketing director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have completely broken the appearance of our cosmetics shelves to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in special training for staff who will be within the scope of advice.
Our safety choice is designed to meet all needs; a healthy environment and comfortable places make us an exciting product store that transforms old commercial habits."
Peter Jones, “announcing” after Holly Willoughby terminates the 11 million-pound contract
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, became a “sacred ” after the TV player Holly Willoughby broke off an 11 million pounds contract with his company to focus on new agreements with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their home and ancillary brand, Truly.
The company had been compared to Goop, the Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
Willoughby, 37 years old, presented his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons’ It, behind with the heart of the end by abandoning participation in a popular life style company at the last moment to focus on new and profitable agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
They say Jones has been a “predicamentist” at a difficult meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, when the TV woman popular admitted that she does not have enough time for the domestic and secondary brand True due to the new agreements worth up to £1.5 million.
The company has been compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand, and was designed to double Willoughby’s assets, their estimated value being 11 million pounds.
When the 37 - year - old Willoughby announced to Instagram that she was about to withdraw from Truly, Jones from Britain flew to stay in one of many of her summer homes.
One source reported: “Truly was the longest member of Holly’s priority list.
This was to be her future assignment that would take her for the next two decades.
Her decision to stop was a surprise for everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so short that the line would go on the market.
There's a full stock of products at Marlow headquarters ready to sell."
Experts believe that the elimination of This Morning, which is among the most popular star in Britain, can cost millions of companies because of high product controls, ranging from powders and candles to clothing and household goods, and possibly lead to further delays in the sale of the product line.
This could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends of Jones and Tra Capp, his wife, for decades.
Willoughby founded Lily and Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined them as president in March.
The couples spend their summer vacations together and Jones on 40 percent of the company of Baldwin, which produces TV.
Willoughby will be the official representative of the brand M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the I'm a Celebrity ITV member.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t want to say anything about his business.”
A difficult conversation “and then we became loved”
He mocked with the criticism he received from the media, for saying something that many would think inappropriate for Presidents, and for being so positive towards the leaders of North Korea.
Why has President Trump left so much?
He said Trump and copied the voice of a reporter.
"I haven't given anything left."
He stated that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June, a major step towards nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
However, discussions about nuclear weapons have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, Mr Ri Yong Ho, the prime ambassador of North Korea, told the International Leader of the United Nations on Saturday, that the North had not received a “appropriate response” from the United States at the first steps of North Korea towards nuclear disarmament.
Instead, he said that the United States continued its business prayers to maintain pressure.
Trump was more positive in his discussion.
"We're very much in line with North Korea," he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
Now our relationship is great."
He said his attempts to improve his relationship with Kim have brought back positive results - fireball tests had stopped, hostages had been released, and the earthly remains of American soldiers were returned home.
He also warned his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
“ It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into a crowded stadium, there were only 200 people standing there, ” Trump said, pointing to the crowds in front of them.
Flooding and earthquakes in Indonesia cause great damage to the island, hundreds of people have perished
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, an international relief organization was told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of people in Lombok had to flee their homes, emergency conditions were not declared, but it is a pretext for international organizations to start their relief activities there.
“ Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it clear that they will not ask for help from international organizations, so this is difficult, ” said Miss Sumbung.
Although the Save the Children organization is putting together a team to travel to Pala, it is still not certain when foreign assistants can start work in the area.
Mr Sutopo, a national disaster officer, said that Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Pala to see if international organizations should be allowed to assist in the relief work.
In view of the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is sadly badly prepared to defend its natural forces.
The flood waves have been built in Aceh, a rare sight at other shorelines.
It seems that the lack of a Pala River Waves has still increased the loss of life, even if the warning has been issued.
Even under the best of circumstances, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia can be a challenge.
Natural disasters make planning even more complex.
A ship that has gone to Lombok to cover up the earthquake’s victims is now on its way to Pala, which will take at least three days to get to the new scene.
President Joko Widod made it the main point of his campaign to reinvigorate Indonesian transport routes and has put a lot of money in the way and railways.
However, the lack of funding has plagued Mr. Joko’s government, but elections will be held next year.
Mr Joko also has to contend with persistent tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more permissive religion.
Over 1,000 people died, and tens of thousands had to leave their homes when the gang of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with their faces, bows, arrows, and other basic weapons.

The statue of the British Parliament of Cromwell is the latest monument accused of “rewriting the story”
The ban on the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban destruction of his fanatic Puritan followers on so many cultural and religious deities in England.
The Cromwell Society, however, said that Mr. Crick's proposal was “inconvenient” and“experience to re-write the story.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the discussion of the removal of statues, it was inevitable that a statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be destroyed.
Andof the civil war against culture was not a decree or the execution of Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his father Thomas in the first century.
A beautiful 19th - century statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a part of a man’s history that many believe is still praised.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is counted by many, perhaps in the late 19th century rather than today, as the guardian of the council against external pressure, in his case of the kingdom.
It is still a big historical question whether this description is entirely correct.
However, it is certain that the conflicts in the middle of the 17th century have shaped the evolution of our nation and that Cromwell is a known person who represents one side of their conflicts.
It is worthy to praise and remember his accomplishment as guardian of the kingdom."
Pigs attack a Chinese farmer and kill him
Pigs attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him on the market in southwestern China, according to local news.
According to South China Morning Post reports on Sunday, the man named solely “Yuan” was found dead with an broken artery and a covered blood near 70 in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou region.
Pigabonda prepares to inject vaccine into pigs in pig’s teat on 30 May, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai region, China.
According to a report, he had traveled with his uncle from the neighboring district of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the cousin found him dead and saw that the door to a nearby pig's beach stood open.
He said that inside the pen was a big shield with a bloody mouth.
According to the report, a court investigation confirmed that the 250 kg of wool had killed the farmer.
“ My cousin’s feet were bloody and wounded, ” said his cousin, whose last name was “Wu,” at the Guiyang Evening News Office.
A security camera tape showed Yuan arriving on the market at 4:40 in the morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his uncle.
The owner of the market told Evering News that the pig had been locked up so that it could not attack anyone else while the police collected evidence at the scene.
According to news, Yuan’s family and its owners are on the market for compensation for his death.
There are recorded examples that pigs attacked people, though they are rare.
In 2016, pigs attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and hurt the man seriously.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - kilo - pound - pig farmer cluttered a tractor until his wife evicted the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba at CBC News said that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that blood can awaken aggressiveness from them.
“ They’re just playing.
They like to glaze and are curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
The remains of Rosa’s hurricane produce great results over the southwestern part of the United States
As foretold, Rosa’s strength is decreasing as he crosses a cooler sea near the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry a large amount of results that could lead to floods in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Roså became a group 1 hurricane with a wind force of up to 136 km per hour, at 5 o’clock in the morning to easterly time on Sunday, and he was located more than 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is planned to go north on Sunday.
At the same time, it will take its formation across the Pacific Ocean to the west coast of the United States, and when Rosa arrives at the Baja California disaster on Monday, as a tropical storm, it will follow a great tropical crash northward into the southwestern part of the United States.
Rosa will follow up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical crash will be mixed with the area that is approaching and produce a large and vast result across the southwest in the following days.
Locally 2.5 to 10 cm of waste may lead to dangerous rapids, soil movement, and possible creeps in the desert.
There will be a great heat-retardant crash of up to 5 to 10 cm in an hour in some places, especially in the southern part of Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm of waste is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in the large Arizona capsules.
The distribution of tropical rains is possible on a fast-track basis.
People are strongly advised against walking into the wilderness when there is a risk of tropical rain.
A lot of rain can turn gulls into a puzzling river and thunderstorms result in a hot air and dust storm.
The area nearest the site will carry local waste in certain areas near the South California shoreline.
There is a potential of more than 1 cm of waste which may cause slight soil and road surface movement.
This is the first outpost of the area during the rain season.
Several distributed tropical clouds will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before the outcome spreads over a larger area late on Monday and Tuesday.
A great result will spread over four states on Tuesday and will last out Wednesday.
In October everywhere in the United States, much temperature change can be expected as the Arctic region cools, but the temperature zone remains relatively warm.
Sometimes this can cause a great deal of heat swings over short distances.
What a fine example of a great heat difference occurred in the United States on Sunday!
There's almost a 7-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the next few days, persistent summer needles will try to build up and disperse again.
It is expected that much of the United States of America will have a warm start in October at temperatures of around 25 degrees or more from the southern to north - east plains.
A fever may go up to 25 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, approximately 6 degrees higher than the average.
Our long - term weather forecast suggests that there is a high probability of temperature above average for the east of the United States in the early October period.
Over 20 million people watched over Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched the exciting testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court judge, on Tuesday and the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual adultery that was supposed to take place in the 9th century, and the testimony was sent to six different channels.
At the same time, the political opposition continued, and TV stations interrupted a regular program to publish the latest news on Friday: Jeff Flake, Senator of the Elders from Arizona, put forward a bill to enable the FBI to investigate the charges for a week.
Ford told the committee of the elders that she was confident that Kavanaugh had drunk her and tried to undress her at a school party.
Kavanaugh, in emotional witnessing, stated that he was confident that it had not happened.
It is likely that more people watched the trial than the 20.4 million that Nielsen reported were watching Friday.
The company measured the average viewing of the TV channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other television channels, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen is also usually in trouble with measuring people’s views in offices.
To put this in perspective, this audience is similar in size to the final game of football or the Oscar Prize Festival.
According to Nielsen, most of the interviews that took all day were at Fox News Channel or 5.69 million.
ABC was second with 3.26 million audiences.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the trial, interest remained great.
Flake was the center of the hill game on Friday.
After the office of this representative of the Republican Party announced that he would choose Kavanaugh in favour of the filmmaker CNN and CBS, when Protestants called on him on Friday morning, when he tried to go into the elevator to get a meeting with the Justice Committee.
He stood down for a few minutes while soon raining over him in a live transmission at CNN.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you."
“ Do you think he is telling the truth to the people of the land? ”
People said to him: “You have power while so many women stand out in power. ”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he said that he would be more explicit at the meeting of the Committee.
The cable and television stations all had direct broadcasts later when the Justice Committee called for a new appointment from Kavanaugh.
Flake said he would only do that if the FBI investigated the charges against the appointed one next week, but a minority of Democrats have encouraged it.
In part, Mr. Flake was convinced by a conversation with his friend Chris Coons, Senator Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and some other senators thereafter.
Flake’s vote changed because it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without the study.
President Trump has authorized an FBI investigation into the accusation against Kavanaugh.
May, the prime minister of Britain, accuses critics of “being in a political game” by Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union to “be in political games” about the future of Britain and to undermine its interests.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of Britain, will be attending a conference of the Team in Birmingham, Britain, 29 September 2018.
In another interview published next to her interview on the cover of the paper, Ms. Boris Johnson, her former Foreign Minister, concluded that the so-called Chequers programme on Brexit, which said that the proposal for the United Kingdom and the European Union to charge customs to each other was “excessively inappropriate”.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpsons in connection with the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested one suspect because of Wayde Sim's death in a deadly shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
The 20 - year - old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for a second - degree murder charge, according to Baton Rouge police.
The authorities published a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, saying that Sims lost his glasses in the flames.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said they had a genetic discovery from Simpson, according to WAFB, Sister CBS.
The police say that Simpson confessed to questioning that he shot Wayde and killed him.
According to his lawyer, $350,000 was guaranteed.
On Friday, an interim report by the Courtologist in East Baton Rouge reported that the cause of death is a gunshot in the head and into the neck.
The authorities wanted to thank the Special Forces of Louisiana, the Police Criminal Investigation Office, the Southern University Police Department and the local cities for helping with the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, director of LSU sports, thanked the law enforcement officers for “their splendour and their search for justice. ”
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall two - foot - long army grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and took 2.6 relapses per game during the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU’s basketball coach, Will Wade, said that the team was “smoothed” and“ in shock ” because of Wayde’s death.
"This is something you worry about constantly," said Wade.
Mountain of Fire spews ashes over the city of Mexico
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention recommended that the Mexicans stay away from the volcano on Saturday after an increase in activity, and 183 cases of gas and ash were recorded over 24 hours.
The center watched with a tumult and quaking out of the volcano.
Social images showed a thin layer of ashes on the bus stops in Mexico’s neighborhood, such as Xochimilco.
Geologists have noticed increased activity in the volcano, 72 km southeast of the capital, from the time of the separation of an earthquake of 7.1 at Richter over the middle of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as “Don Goyo”, has been active since 1994.
Police in combat with Catalan separatist rights for the birthday of a voluntary vote
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after stand-alone Protestants met unruly police forces, and thousands took part in protests on the first birthday of the controversial elections in Catalonia to declare independence.
A group of masked separatists stoned an irresistible policy with eggs and threw a scent paint that formed dark dusty clouds in the streets, usually full of tourists.
Later, conflicts broke out the other day, and police officers used colds to keep the waves in check.
The separate groups shouted, “We don’t forget and don’t forgive” for a few hours while their opponents shouted, “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen had to be accompanied by minor injury suffered in protests, according to the local media.
Many tensions continue to exist in the autonomous region one year after the national vote on October 1, Madrid, was judged unlawfully by the authorities, but was welcomed by the Catalan separation.
The majority of voters chose independence, but participation was poor, since most of the people who were opposed ignored the election.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people were injured last year when police tried to stop elections at the election points around the region, which led to conflict.
A group of independents had stayed overnight on Friday to prevent protests to support the police.
The polling process took place, but it was forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68 - year - old electric engineer, took part in protests with his wife, saying that he was no longer hopeful of Catalan independence.
“ In the past, we experienced some of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having reached the necessary but immediate victory in regional conventions last December, the Catalan classes of independence have had difficulties in maintaining steam for a year, with many of the most famous leaders either in voluntary exile or waiting for trial because of their role in the organization of the vote and the Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old engineer who accepted the protests in support of the police on his phone, said that the politicians of both states had encouraged the dispute.
He said, “The tension is increasing all the time. ”
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison waiting for trial since last year, announced that he would present himself to the European Parliament next year.
“ My message in European procurement is the best way to condemn the backdrop of democratic values and oppression we have seen in the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: People arrested after driving to the house

The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m., U.S.A.
Detective Bob Blemmings said that the gates and the building itself had been damaged.
It is also possible that the bullet was from a crossbow toward the car.
No score of 1-0 win Livingston against Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga assured the victory of Livingston
The lower section of Livingston surprised Rangers, and Steven Gerrard had to endure his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox team.
Mark Dolly Menga made the difference, and Gary Holt's team is now in second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard has still not worked at the field in the prime department of this season, and against Hearts, which is eight points ahead of the top, on the next Sunday.
For that game, Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna in the European Parliament on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston is still undefeated in the six - win league, and Holt’s main coach has not yet had to experience loss since his replacement with Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston Loses Devices Against Bitless Guests
Holts was supposed to have been over long before the target, but their directness caused Rangers great trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then passed by after running through the defense to receive a skull from Graig Halkett across the target.
The guests let Rangers play in front of them calmly, knowing that they could cause the guests trouble in the right places.
And that was how the goal was highlighted.
Rangers got an extra kick, and Livingston worked to create a target instrument. Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga together, which received a shipment and scored from the center of the viteig.
At that point, Rangers had ruled the ball, but the defense of the locals was unbreakable and Liam Kelly, the goalkeeper did not have to do much.
So it continued into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos was able to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped off the feet of Allan McGregor, Ranger's goalman, and Lithgow shot from the ground after a quest from Livingston.
Squirrels were constantly hit in the warey of Livingston, but were kicked off, and two demands for warheads--after the defense of Halketts against the lipsman Glenn Middleton, and one after hand--was dismissed.
Lifeston Analysis “Sensible”
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland reporter at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Nice performance and finale for Livingston.
For a normal man, they stood wonderfully and continued to go ahead of all expectations on their way up.
Their style of play and team have hardly changed since they returned to the upper division, but Holt deserves much praise for the fact that he has been passing away from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Mr. Halkett, the captain was extremely good and led a fully organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toe all the time.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they have been under Gerrard’s control, they played far ahead of expectations.
They failed to complete their quests and only once were able to open up the whale half of the locals, so this should be a wakeup to Rangers who are now in the middle of the league.
Erdogan receives a blind reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met over breakfast in Berlin, they were smiled and bright on Saturday.
This is the last day of Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the two NATO nations.
Differences have been raised between them on issues such as human rights, the media and the entry of Turkey into the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open up a new giant mosque.
The city is the home of most Turkish residents outside Turkey itself.
The police used security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many of its supporters were able to see their president.
The hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan - many of them Kurdar - also reported and condemned both Erdogan’s policy and the decision of German governments to invite him to the country.
The two Protestant groups reflect how controversial this guest is, but he is hailed as a hero of some Turks in Germany and hated as a dictator of others.
Dectford’s Conflict: A rider died in a conflict with a car
A rider died in a conflict with a car in London.
The attack took place near the streets of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a large street in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, about 10.15 p.m.
The driver of the car stopped, and the medical staff gave attention, but the man died at the scene of an accident.
A few months after another biker died in a conflict where a driver drove off on Children’s Street, a mile [1.5 km] from Saturday’s accident.
The police said that she was working to identify the man and let his closest residents know.
The road and direct bus rides have been closed and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards got hurt in trouble
Six jailers were injured when the civilians broke into a men’s security prison, according to a prison report.
In the Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at 9:30 p.m., British localities broke out on Sunday and still geise.
“Tornado” Special Forces have been called in the area to try to control the unrest of eight prisoners and are only in one of the cells of the prison.
The guards were exposed to minor facial injury at the scene.
A prison spokesperson said: “ Specially trained jailers have been called out to deal with cases in the Long Lartin prison.
Six employees have been brought in for injury.
There is no violence in our prisons, and we clearly state that the responsibilities will be handed over to the police and could be expected to spend even more time behind lock and punch."
Over 500 prisoners are in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the warden had had to go to the hospital after a prisoner attacked him.
And in October of last year, an unresolved police officer was called to deal with a serious disorder of peace, where workers with billions of bullets were attacked.
The hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (dry areas could benefit from)
It is rare that the tropical regions cross Arizona, but it is likely that it will be early next week when the remains of the hurricane Rosa cross the southwest, with the risk of rapid flooding.
The country’s weather department has already issued alerts on Monday and Tuesday in the western part of Arizona and the southern and western parts of Nevada, the southeastern part of California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass Phoenix directly on Tuesday and be late on Monday with a result.
On Twitter, the Phoenix Weather Service said that only “ten showers have been able to maintain their strength to be classed as tropical storms or storms in less than 320 km away from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km of the Arizona border."
The last prediction from the nation’s hurricane center predicts 5-10 cm of waste, with a single output of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
It is likely that the result will be 2.5 to 5 cm in other parts of the southwest, including the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, with the possibility of a single result up to 10 cm.
For those who are not in danger of falling into rapid floods, the result of Rosa could be a blessing, for there are great droughts in the area.
Although the flood can cause great damage, some of these results will have a positive effect, since drought is now in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drying Authority, there is at least a very large drought in over 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second-highest class," according to reports fromweather.com.
First, the hurricane Rosa will land on the Baja California quake in Mexico.
Roså was still classified as a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind force of 136 km per hour and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and travels north at 19 km per hour.
The storm passes over the sea of the Pacific Ocean, and so its power decreases.
It is therefore expected to land in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday or Monday evening.
There is a potential for high results in some areas in Mexico, with a significant risk of flooding.
“It is expected that up to 7.5 to 15 cm will be reached in Baja California and into the northwestern part of Sonora, with a possibility of up to 25 cm,” said a report fromweather.com.
Roså will then head north over Mexico, as a tropical storm, then reach Arizona border in the early third of the morning as a tropical reserve, then continue up through Arizona and come to the southern part of Utah late on Tuesday evening.
“ The greatest risk expected from Rosa or its remains is a very high source in Baja California, the northwestern part of Sonora, and the southwestern part of the desert area of the United States, ” said a hurricane center of the country.
This waste is expected to cause life - threatening rapids and soil movement in the deserts, and the tip of the mountains.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests due to attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20 - year - old have been arrested for an attempted murder, after a 16 - year - old was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The youth was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, about 04:00 p.m. to a British placetime on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition is said to be “steady. ”
One 17 - year - old, two 18 - year - olds and one 20 - year - olds were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset Police.
The police have been waiting for a witness who might have phone records of what happened.
Trump says that Kavanaugh “felt to feel evil and anger” from the Democratic Party
“The vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the merciless and insulting practices of the Democratic Party,” said Trump at a meeting with supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “was able to experience evil and anger ” from the Democratic Party throughout his appointment.
Kavanaugh witnessed to the council on Thursday, where he harshly denied the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually attacked her several decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified to the committee about his accusations.
On Saturday, the president said that “The Americans had seen genius and humanity and courage” of Kavanaughs the other day.
“The vote confirming the Kavanaugh judge is a vote confirming one of the smartest lawyers today, a lawyer with a magnificent CV as a public official,” he said to a group of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s appointment when he spoke of the importance of the Republicans ’ supporters participating in the mid - term talks.
“ There are five weeks in one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't volunteer, but I do, though really," he said.
“ That’s why I’m going around the world to fight for great candidates. ”
Trump claimed that Democrats were working to “tuff and hinder. ”
The first key vote of the Elders’ Department on the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place no later than Friday, as instructed by the representative of the Republican interview with CNN.
Hundreds died after earthquakes and floods in Indonesia, and likely the number of deaths will increase.
At least 384 people died, and many were spoiled by a huge wave of water on the shores, when a great earthquake and flood floods struck over the Indonesian island of Suawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach of Pala, Friday, when up to six feet [6 m] of land on the beach at sunset, washed out a number of people on the sea, and destroyed everything that happened to them.
After an earthquake of 7.5 points [7.5 points] on Richter, the flood wave developed.
“ Last night, when the flood waves developed, people were still on the beach and did not escape immediately, so they died, ” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson of the Indonesia disaster agency, an information meeting in Jakarta.
“ The wave did not come alone, ” said Nugroho, adding that the flood wave had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 miles [800 km] before it fell on the beach.
Some climbed a tree to escape the flood wave and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were moved to 24 centers in Pala.
Air pictures produced by the disaster agency showed many ruined buildings and shops, twists, and unutilized bridges, and mosques surrounded by water.
Afterquakes continued to ride over the beach town on Saturday.
The earthquakes had a row of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesia Institute on Food and Technology stated in a statement that the energy released from the depression in the big quake on Friday had been about 200 times higher than that of the atom bomb that fell in the city of Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow flea, could have increased the size of the flood wave, said the establishment.
Nugroho said the damage was “real” and that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls, and hotels had crashed.
A few victims ’ bodies were found trapped under a pile of broken buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the loss and damage to property could be greater along the shoreline 300 km north of Pala, in an area called Dongla, which is closer to the source of the earthquake.
“Dongagla has no information,” Nugroho said.
“ Over 300,000 people live there, ” said the Red Cross, adding that their employees and volunteers were on their way to the area.
“ It has already become a tragedy, but it may be much worse, ” said the Red Cross.
The Agency was criticized by many people on Saturday for not telling us that a floodblower had broken away in Pala, although public representatives said that the centuries had arrived within the time of the warning.
In a video published on the public media, a man could hear a cry from the top of the building to warn the people on the street that a floodstorm was approaching.
Only minutes later, the floodstorm will strike on the beach and carry buildings and cars away.
Reuters was unable to verify the video immediately.
The earthquake and the floodstorm caused a lack of electricity that prevented Pala’s communication and made it difficult for authorities to plan relief work.
The army has begun to send aircraft with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but people who have been helped by the area still urgently need food and other needs.
The city’s airports have only been reopened for auxiliary operations and will be closed in October.
Joko Widodo, President of the United States, will visit a refugee center in Pala on Sunday.
The number of deaths is more than 800 after a flood in Indonesia.
Things are very bad.
World Vision workers from Doggala have reached the city of Pala, where they seek refuge in tents that were set up in the park outside their offices. They were destroyed on the way, according to Mr. Dosaba.
“People said they saw many houses completely destroyed, ” he said.
Things are very bad.
While relief groups have started a difficult relief work, some have complained that foreign relief workers with a high level of expertise were inhibited from travelling to Pala.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign finance, supplies and personnel may only begin if the disaster area is declared an emergency area.
It hasn't been done yet.
“ It’s still a local accident area, ” said Aulia Arriani, a composer of the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared that this is a disaster area, we can open up foreign aid, but no statement has yet come."
When the second night fell on Pala after the earthquake and the floodwave on Friday, friends and their families, who are still missing, kept in the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miraculous stories that shed hope on the devastating headlines that follow natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a start.
On Sunday, a woman’s relief workers who had been trapped under the ruins of two days with their mother’s body beside them.
Gendon Subando, a coach of the Indonesian flight team, had been the coach of two missing gliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mr. Monday.
“ As a man with long experience in flying, I have my own emotional burden to bear, ” he said.
Mr. Gendon reported that the hour after the news was heard within the flight group because the Roa Roa Hotel crashed, he had sent whatsApp a message in desperation to the flight crew who stayed in Pala and joined the beach festival.
His message, however, only showed a grey signal, instead of a blue one.
“I don’t think the message was received,” he said.
The thieves steal $26,750 when filling in Newport on the Living
On Friday morning, thieves kidnapped 26,750 dollars from Brink's employee, who was filling a Newport on the Livere ATM, according to a news report from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been emptying a ATM in the entertainment area and was filling more money on him, said Detective Dennis McCarthy, in the announcement.
When he was doing his job, another man “came to the rear of Brink’s employee ” and stole a bag of money intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects fleeing the scene, according to the announcement, but police did not reveal how many were involved.
Those who might have information about the suspects are asked to contact the Newport police on phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rapper changes his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name--in Ye.
He reported the change on Twitter on Saturday and wrote: “The world previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time, using the name as the title of its eighth album, which came out in June.
The change occurs during his participation in the Saturday Night Live feature where he is expected to report his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grandi in the show, which for “emotional reasons, ” said the manufacturer.
West has previously said that this name has religious meaning for him, but it is also shortened by his present name.
“ I think that ‘ye’ (you) is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,’ said West earlier in the year when he discussed his record name with the radio director Big Boy.
“ So I’m you, I’m us, it’s us.
It went from Kanye, which means the one, and to just Ye--to be just a reflection of the good in us, the wicked, the confused, everything.
The record is rather a reflection of who we are."
He's one of many famous raps who's changed his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former collaborator West, has also written his name with and without strings and capitals.
The elected President of Mexico promises not to use the military against citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military force against public cities, now that the country will soon remember the 50th birthday of bloody revenge against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised that “the military never use to oppress the Mexicans. ”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot at a peaceful protest on the square and killed up to 300 people at a time when student left - minded movement was taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico by giving all students monthly strength and opening up more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and the lack of learning opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double the amount of money for satellites
Now that China is increasingly more active in the use of satellites, the United States should double the amount of funds it spends in research in this area, says the inventor and the satellite user Kai-Fu Lee who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The reports were made after different departments of the U.S. government published reports on artificial intelligence, even though the United States did not formally have a complete satellite programme.
China, on the other hand, announced its plan last year: it aims to be in the first place in a new generation with artificial intelligence by 2030.
“ It would be a good start to double the amount of money that is being studied by satellites, compared with the fact that all other countries are so much further behind the United States, and we are waiting to see the next major discovery in satellite intelligence, ” said Lee.
Double funding could double the likelihood that the next major discovery in artificial intelligence will be made in the United States, Lee said to CNBC at an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Orderer,” published this month by the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, director of the company Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in Face++, is one of the major artificial companies in China.
In the late 1980 ’ s, he worked in an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, who won the best player in the United States in Othello, and later he was the manager of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee spoke of previous technological competitions held by the U.S. authorities, such as the Civil War Wars, and asked when the next competition would be held, to identify the next cells.
Scientists in the United States often have to work hard to get strength from the government, said Lee.
“ It’s not China that likes the most thoughtful, it’s the business,” said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired geniuses from colleges to work with satellites over the past few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen its artificial intelligence research.
“I feel that those with a doctoral degree should automatically be allowed to suspend, ” he said.
In July 2017, the Council of China published its plan for the future.
China’s Natural Sciences Institute provides funding to people working at university institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and similar public institutions in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defence set up a satellite centre, designed to cooperate with both industry and educational institutions, and the White House reported on the formation of special committees on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that there was an investment of $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
For NSF, it invests over 100 million dollars annually in artificial intelligence studies.
At the same time, American legislation, which was designed to provide a safety advice on satellite intelligence, has not continued for many months.
The Macedonian people vote for a national vote on whether or not to change the name of the country
The citizens of Macedonia chose a national vote on Sunday to change the country’s name to the “Nordic Republic of Macedonia” in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has closed their application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
The province of Greece, called Macedonia, claims that the name of their neighbours in the north is equivalent to the requirement in their territory and therefore denied entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June, based on the new name, but nationalistic opposers claim that the change will undermine the image of the majority of Macedonian inhabitants of Slavic origin.
Mr Ivanov, President-in-Office of the Council, has said that he will not take part in the vote and campaign to ignore it, has raised doubts that the vote will reach 50 percent of the minimum required so that the vote will be valid.
The question at the campaign is as follows: “Would you like to join NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece? ”
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that this is a reasonable price for Macedonia to be joined by the EU and NATO, one of those formed after Yugoslavia’s fall.
“I came here today to choose the future of the country for young people in Macedonia so that it can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Oliver Georgievska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although the outcome is not legally binding, enough senators have said that they will follow it and bind it to law.
The name change would require approval of two thirds of the House.
The election committee said that nothing unusual had been reported at 1:00 p.m.
On the other hand, only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent of the final assembly in 2016, were involved when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“ I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old in Skopje capital city.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko paid his vote in the Macedonian national vote on whether to change the name of the country, which would lead to its entry into NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the council in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, worked to prepare a small area and set up chairs in front of tents built by those who will ignore the vote.
"We're adjourned NATO and the EU, but we want to be a member of our heads high, don't go through the service door," said Kavardarkov.
“ We are a poor land, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn something else like China or Russia and become part of Europe's relationship."
The Prime Minister of Zaev says that NATO will bring the necessary funds to Macedonia, where the percentage of unemployed is over 20 percent.
“I believe that the longest majority will agree that more than 80 percent of people in the country are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
He said that acceptance would be “a confirmation of our future. ”
A survey published on Monday from the Macedonian Policy Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the national vote, which is lower than the minimum required.
A second television television survey, Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of respondents were going to pay their vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would say yes.
In order for the national vote to be valid, there must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote is not approved, it could mean the first serious shock to the policy of the Western government from last May.
See: Sergio Aguero, actor Manchester City, goes through all protection Brighton and score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling left lightly with the protection of Brighton in the victory of Manchester City 2.0 on Saturday at the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored his mark in 65 minutes.
The Argentine army received a shipment in the middle of the field at the beginning of the call.
He spread past three defenders of Brighton and then went out to the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green - dressed defenders.
He got past one defender and then ran away a few more on the side of Brighton’s Vite.
Then he sent to the left, and found Sterling there.
The English vanguard used the first touch within the diner to send the ball back to Aguero, who used the right foot to play on Mathew Ryan, the Brighton target, with a shot at the right side of the goal.
"Aguero has some foot problems," said Pep Guardiola, director of City, to reporters.
“ We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then it happened.
We were lucky he made a point at this moment."
But it was Sterling who gave them the blue first goal of the first game.
That mark came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a shipment deep in Brighton’s field half at that time.
He sent a great long ball to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane kicked the ball several times and then sent to Sterling towards the fart.
City's army sent the ball to the Internet just before he ran out.
City is playing at Hoffenheim in the Championship at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday at the Rhine-Necker stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play kick-off game against Rockies
Since the Nationals have been excluded from the finals, there was no reason to force on a different start.
But the brave Scherzer hopes to be thrown on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have the chance to get to the end, but they have one game ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the West.
Rockies at least got a wildcard seat with her 5-2 wins at the Nationals on Friday night, but the team is still seeking to reach their first branch.
“ Even if we play for free, we can at least play for an electric atmosphere in Denver, as well as for the other team, certainly after playing their best game this year.
Why shouldn't I want to compete in such a situation?"
Nationals are still going to report who will be the first pitcher in the game of Sunday, but it is estimated that they will let Scherzer throw in these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was about to start a game on the 34th occasion, took an exercise session on Thursday and would throw on a Sunday, which is his usual Sabbath.
This right-handed caster in Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 gusts of wind for 220 2/3 cycles of this season.
Trump visits West Virginia
The president indirectly referred the matter to Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court Judge, when he spoke of the importance of the rebel supporters participating in the mid - term elections.
“ Everything is at stake in November.
There are five weeks in one of our most important elections.
It's one of the big, big... I don't volunteer, but I do, but that's why I go all over the world to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say: “See this horrific, radical group of democrats, you can see it happening now.
And they are determined to regain control by any means necessary, you see the ferocity, the evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go to get control and control, they just want control and control, we don't give it to them.
He said that the Democrats were working to “tuff and hinder. ”
“ And it has been seen in the last four days, ” he said, saying, “to the democrats be“ angry and wicked and cruel and untruthless. ”
He named the elder minister, Diane Fenstein, the dominant democrat in the committee of elders, on behalf of the congregation, and was answered with a loud bow from the audience.
“ Do you remember her answer?
Is it you who made the paper?
Ha, what?
I was waiting for one... it was really bad body language, the worst thing I've ever seen."
The labor group is no longer an infallible church.
He will not tolerate those who express his mind
When Momentum’s intervention officer in my group chose to give me an order, it was hardly surprising.
After all, I am the last of the many ministers of the labor group who have been told that we are not welcome, just for expressing our mind.
Joan Ryan, my fellow senator received similar treatment because she protested harsh prejudices against Jews.
In my case, the motion for a resolution came because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues were the importance of having responsible economic policies, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues, and Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting for Nottingham East on Friday said that “we want the meetings not to understand beyond and to be successful.”
During my eight - year career as a senator of the labor group, Friday meetings have been very often just that.
Sadly, it is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of “bigger and better” politics has been forgotten if it ever began.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions have not been reached in the Workers’ Party and that all opinions are judged by whether they are acceptable to the leaders of the Party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I once thought had similar political views to those I had, began to expect me to take a complete setback and to support opinions I had never before agreed on, whether on national security or on the common EU market.
Every time I speak in public--and then it doesn't matter what I say--compensate social abuses that are called after my departure, the central government denied and I said that I shouldn't be in the Workers' Party.
And this isn't just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, where most of the comments I get to me are usually political.
I admire professionalism and the confirmation of those who have to endure the sanctity of sexual or prejudiced insults every day but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing things in this political period is how attacks and insults have become a natural part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Workers’ Party should be a warm, unfailing culture.
The reality is that we are no longer an incorruptible church, and with every lack of trust or change in electoral rules, the class is becoming increasingly narrow.
For the last two years, I have received many counsel to give up on myself, not to be too loud, and then I would be “all right. ”
But I did not decide to take part in politics to do so.
Since I became a member of the Workers' Party as a student 32 years ago, motivated by the neglect of the government of Thatcher, who left my school office in deliberation, I have fought for better public service for those who need it most, whether I was in town or in council.
I have never assigned my political views, nor at last elections.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my policies and where I disagree with current leaders.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would just like to say that when the country is heading for Brexit, which will harm home, business and our public service, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy in my loyalty to the leaders of the Armed Forces.
But my only message, which I would like to send from me, is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for those who are within my specialty, whether they are members of the Workers' Party or not: I serve you with pride and I promise that no threat of variation or political disfellowshipment will cause me to fail to do what I believe to be for the best of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefiled joint Ayr goes to the top
Two late touchdowns might have tapped the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr had the victory in this immediate game of the day in the Tennent's Premiery Division.
They are now on the top of the list, and one of the 10 are still undefeated.
Finally, it was stronger their defense and better use of opportunities that made the home more successful and Peter Murchie was fully entitled to be content.
“ We’ve had tough opposition in our games up here and are still undefiled, so I must be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said: “Animals deserve to be praised, they took advantage of their opportunities better than we do,"
Mark Grant Anderson introduced Ayr to 14 minutes after Frazier Climo turned the lead, but the yellow card on the Scottish leader, who was allowed to play the game with Warriors, enabled Melrose to make the numbers talk and Jason Baggot reached touchdown.
Climo increased Ayr’s leadership with hell before he scored with kicks just before half a game and then touched a mark and came Ayr over 17-5 at half a game.
But Melrose started his second half of the power and touchdown of Patrick Anderson, after Baggot turned his quest, reduced the target difference to five points.
Then, after a long break, Ayr continued to make serious injuries at Ruaridh Knott, who had to take off a playground, and thereafter, Ayr continued to increase his leadership by a touchdown from Stafford McDowall after Climo turned his quest.
Blair Macpherson, leader of Ayr, then got the yellow card and Melrose used to be a man over with a touchdown from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a hard time.
On the other hand, when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for putting Climo free of the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind the Ayr visit after an extra fight.
Climo turned his visit to, as he did again immediately after the start, after Kyle Rowe reached the kick of David Amrstrong from the diner and sent to Gregor Henry who scored the fifth touch mark of the team.
Star Still Game the components ready for a new career in the restaurant store
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game components, seems ready to move to the restaurant business after he found out that he was appointed director of the restaurant business.
Kieran, 56 years old, plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC games popular, which he writes and plays together with his old partner from the entertainment competition, Creg Hemphil.
The two - year - old has announced that the forthcoming ninth series will be the last, and so it seems that Kiernan has plans for life after Craiglang.
According to official files, he's the manager of Aktormorn Limited.
The actor wanted nothing to say about the story, but a source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan would become a participant in the “living restaurant bransa” Glasgow City.
“The sea is ours”: The shoreless land of Bolivia hopes that the Court of Justice will open its way back to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors are guarding the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flag blue flags.
“ We have a right to the sea, ” says Lake Titicaca, “to the Amazon River.
It's our duty to recover it."
In many places, throughout Bolivia, the memory of the shoreline, which lost to Chile in bloody conflicts in the 19th century, still in fresh memory - along with the desire to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes may be the strongest for decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision from the International Court of Justice in The Hague on October 1, after five years of speaking.
“ Bolivia has power, unity, and atherosclerosis, and, of course, awaits the decision with a positive mind, ” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomate.
Many people of Bolivia will be following the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court of Justice will decide on Bolivia in favour of their demand that Chile be obliged to have access to Bolivia, after decades of difficult conversation.
The decision on Monday is also very important for Evo Morales, the president of the country of Indians, who will be in a controversial struggle for recycling next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he promised late August.
However, some investigators believe that the Court of Justice is unlikely to decide in favour of Bolivia, and that it would not change if he did.
The Court of Justice, which has headquarters in Holland, has no authority to give a land from Chile and has stated that the decision will not affect the outcome of the discussions.
The fact that the court’s ruling comes only six months after the final talk was heard indicates that the matter “had not been complicated, ” said Paz Sárate, an international expert in Chile.
It is also possible that during the past four years, Bolivia was not an advance but a return to the land.
“ Today’s Bolivian government has stolen the issue of access to the sea, ” said Zárate.
Morale's talk has reduced all kindness from Chile, she thought.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to argue at some point, but it will be very difficult after this.
Since 1962, the two countries have not signed on to transmitters.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president of Bolivia and representative of the country in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision had taken an unusual short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “a unique opportunity to open up to a new relationship with Sile” and will have the opportunity to“ put an end to a dispute that takes 139 years back in time, both countries to benefit, ” he said.
Thus, Calzadilla also denied that Morales, another of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this issue as a political practice.
“ Bolivia will never give after its right to have access to the Pacific, ” he added.
“ The cut is an opportunity to see that we need to recover from the past. ”
North Korea says that nothing will happen to nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, Foreign Secretary of North Korea says that the country will never take down its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Ri held his speech on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called upon the United States to follow the promises they made at a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
His report is now Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, who seems to be reintroducing discussions on nuclear weapons, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea.
Ri says that it is “dreaming” to maintain a commercial request and protest against a declaration of the end of Korea will ever push North Korea.
Washington does not want to accept the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes clear steps to take down his nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to meet again at another meeting.
Much doubt, however, prevails that Pyongyang is serious about taking down weapons that the country is likely to see as the only way to secure security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
fashion shows in Paris present the latest line of big hats that will come in fashion fairs near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or be completely hidden from the sun, you do not have to look any further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a number of strange hats in excess of their SS19 line in the fashion field, which enchanted the fashion week duo in Paris.
This summer, many of the images of unspeakable hats have been published on Instagram, and these designers have had their recent creations in fashion shows.
The main work after Valentino was a large, light - brown hat with a wide range of bands that looked like feathers and covered the tops of the earth.
Out of other parts of excess size, watermelons set jewels, cedar hats, and even pineapples, but these things are not designed to keep heat on their heads.
Thom Browne also introduced many strange masks, just at the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had combined lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One griman was likened to a suffocating tube and glasses, while others resembled melting ice in bread form.
If you want to customs, you're lucky.
The fashion experts predict that the big hats could soon be sold in fashion shops near you.
Large hats come in the heels of “La Bomba,” a straw hat with more than 60cm of large bars that have decorated heads from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fashion mark behind the extremely unending hat, which was seen in all the social media, was inspired by another large part that appeared in the fashion area — a straw strand bag that was almost as large as the swimmer - shaped model that carried it.
The orange canvas, with a striped and white handhold made of leather, was the main part of La Riviera SS10’s Jacquemus’ line of clothing at the fashion week in Paris.
Luke Armitage, the famous artist, said in an interview with FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags appear in fashion shops for the next summer – where the designer has had such a great impact should be difficult to ignore the demand for extra sized items.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Private schools in Scotland are known for their students’ outstanding achievements, and this has continued in 2018 with new, magnificent test scores, which are still supported by individual and group achievements in sports, art, music, and other community practices.
These schools have up to 30,000 students all over Scotland, with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (Skoska Private School, SCIS) in defense of them, and they strive to provide their students and their parents with the best possible service.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further further training, the career they have chosen, and their position as citizens of the world.
As a teacher who can put together and teach a custom - designed curriculum, we see that new languages continue to be popular subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it touches his mind.
If thou speak unto him in his mother's language, it toucheth his heart.
This is an important reminder that we cannot just trust in English to build up relationships and trust in people from other countries.
This year’s test results show that languages are at the top of the art, with the highest proportion of students attending private schools.
68 percent of students who learned a foreign language received a nice impression of A.
The data collected from 74 schools in the SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received CPR A in mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French learners, and 63 percent of Spanish learners also received A.
This shows that in Scotland, private schools support foreign languages that will require the skills of children and young people in the future.
At the moment, language, as an optional language, is placed in the same place as scientific subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the study books of private schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that, for reasons that employers made it difficult to manage jobs, 17 percent was due to the lack of language skills.
Therefore, language awareness is becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for their future jobs.
Now that more and more jobs require knowledge in languages, this ability is needed in a global world.
Whatever careers people choose, they will have a real advantage in the future if they learn another language, a knowledge that lasts their lives.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will provide an automatic advance for a more complex person in the competitive world.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov on more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent of them could not speak another language well enough to maintain conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two - letter percentage, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for today’s children to invest immediately in language learning.
Polyglobin, especially in new - market countries, will give children a better opportunity to find important jobs.
In Scotland, the language they teach varies from school to school.
A certain number of schools will focus on classical news, while others will teach languages that are considered most important for Britain when it comes to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interest lies, it will always be possible to choose from languages in private schools with specialized teachers.
Skeptical private schools commit themselves to offering a study environment, which will prepare children and prepare them with the expertise they need to achieve success, no matter what the future will bring.
There is no denying that at this time, in global commercial environments, language remains necessary for the future of the country, and it must be reflected in education.
In fact, today’s language should really be viewed as “the international skills of communication. ”
Private schools will continue to offer choice, diversity, and superiority to young people in Scotland.
Il faut been le faire.
John Edwards is the chairman of the Scottish Private School Board
LeBron plays his first game for Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
It's almost over for fans who want to watch LeBron James play their first game for Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, Coach Lakers, has announced that James will play on Sunday at the opening game of the season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has not yet been decided in how many minutes he will play.
“ It will be longer than a minute and shorter than 48, ” said Walton on Laker’s public website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for Lakers, said on Twitter that James would probably play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked into his plans for six Laker’s program before the start of the season.
“ During this period of my career, I don’t have to play games before the season to prepare myself,” he said.
Timer for Trump election meeting in West Virginia and YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a number of election meetings and the first one is in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five organized meetings next week, where he will also stop at friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his choice of a new Supreme Court judge has been suspended, Trumped out to build up support for subsequent mid-term elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the assembly when voting on November.
What time is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, and how can you watch him online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is due to begin at 7 p.m. on the east coast tonight, Saturday 29 September, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia on the Internet below through live broadcasts on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will refer the trial to Brett Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court judge, where tensions prevailed because of the accusations of sexual harassment, the vote of the Senate to confirm him as a judge was suspended for up to a week while the FBI investigates the accusations.
However, the main goal of the Trump meeting is to help the Republicans get better, but they await difficult elections in November.
Therefore, the message from Trump’s campaign was that these five meetings, held next week, were aimed at “filling volunteers and supporters with zeal as the Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they have in the body of elders and in the council, ” according to Reuter’s news firm.
“ Overtime is so necessary for the President’s plan that he will travel to as many states as he can already begin a second period of campaign, ” said a former speaker from Trump’s campaign at Reuter’s news office.
The meeting tonight will be held at the Wesbanco stadium in Wheeling and supporters are expected to come from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and the media from Pittsburgh report to him,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
The meeting on Saturday will be the second visit of Trump to West Virginia in this month, but he won over 40 percent in this region in 2016.
Trump wants to try to help Patrick Morrissey, the candidate of the Republican Republic of West Virginia to the Senate, which is in the bottom of the polls.
“ It’s not good for Morrissey to know that the president has to come and try to increase his popularity,” said Simon Hader, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuter’s news firm.
Ryder Bicar 2018: The United States of America shows its willingness to keep the hope alive for the individual race on Sunday
After three one - sided rings, the fourth, which was the afternoon of Saturday, could be exactly what was needed in this competition for the Ryder Cup.
Fulfilment in success is a sports term that has been invented and that players truly believe in, and never more than in the competition like this.
Where would they say that success is now lying?
“ They had six points ahead, and now it’s four points, so that success is more on our side now, I guess,” said Jordan Spieth when he set off in the race of the day.
Of course, Europe has its head, four points ahead, with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth said, think they have a little wind in the sails and they can be hopeful over many, especially the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each got three points of four.
Spieth has played great things all the time, leading his example.
After he and Thomas had been two points below two games, the Kingdom Halls increased as it went on, and he put down an important cushion to hold all four stages of the game.
His bribe, who gave them victory on the 15th hole, received similar shouts of the kind that tell you that he believes that the American people still have hope of victory.
“You just have to dive deep and think about your own game,” said Spieth.
That's the only thing these players can do now.
18 holes to work in the ladder.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of Ryder the cup.
This strange but fascinating European couple have won four games of four and can't do anything wrong.
“Moliwood ” was the only couple who had the blame last Saturday, but they also managed to avoid blame on Saturday morning, the afternoon on Friday, and on the nine - hole field on Friday morning.
The game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the loud audience clearly show that they are the couple who have to win on Sunday, and there would be no popular player to seal the possible victory of the European team, but Fleetwood or Molinari, is the sun sitting over the Le Golf National Square.
The best option is that both did it simultaneously on different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went lightly with Sergio Garcia, the fourth quarter of the morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
In the first nine holes, the Spaniard and Swift dug into a hole that they could never scratch.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The quads and quads are so exciting to watch closely for the communication between the couple, their advice, the advice they do not give, and how a game program can change in one winter.
While Europe has played better as a result of this and has a considerable advance before the end of the day, this quarter also showed that the team of Americans has the will to fight that some have doubted it had, especially the rest of the United States.
Europe with 10-6 leadership for the final day of the race for the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good lead before the closing day of the Ryder Cup after the four - ball and the four of Saturday, with the first 10-6 against the United States.
The stardiving Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over Tiger Woods, who had a problem, and have got four points on the Le Golf National field.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, who would like to regain the prize cup, which it lost on the Hazeltine field two years ago, showed great superiority over the U.S. team at the four - ball game of the morning and won 3-1.
The United States showed more resistance in the 4-games and played two games than failed to win the stairwell.
Jim Furyks needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to continue his cup.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, and he and Molinari, who had the nickname “Molliwood” after a wonderful weekend, are only another couple who win four points from their first four games in Ryder’s history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four - ball game, they showed great unity and won the Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed his genius occasionally, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four - ball games and four games, and seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the four - ball game of the morning, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the four games and won 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are in the first and third place on the list of the best golfers in the world.
Europe, however, did not go all the way in this mild and gust - same day southwest of Paris.
A three - footed winner in the big race in golf, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas set the goal for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They worked 2-1 against Jon Rahm from Spain and Ian Poulter in four ball games and later came back and won the Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the 4-game after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in Ryder’s history that the team has won up four points between the beginning of an individual race, although Furyks’ team only needs a draw to continue.
However, after two days of second contact, it appears that on Sunday, they will be overexploited.
North Korea says one-sided dearmament “inability” without trust
The Foreign Secretary of North Korea said on Saturday that the continued trade request only jews their distrust in the United States, and it would be impossible for the country to take down its nuclear weapons one-sided under such circumstances.
At the annual General Assembly of the United Nations, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea had taken considerable steps to show goodwill in the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, taking down the nuclear testing area, and promising to risk the development of nuclear weapons and technology.
“ On the other hand, we have seen no corresponding reaction from the United States, ” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about the safety of our country, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to take one-sided down our nuclear weapons first.”
Although Ri has repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to “staged” approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded for every step it took, his statement seemed to be specific in that he did not deny one-sided nuclear disarmament as Pyongyang had previously done.
Mr Trump referred to the joint statement by Mr. Kim Jong Un and Mr. Donald Trump at the first meeting of the President-in-Office of the United States and the North Korean leader, in Singapur on 12 June, where Mr. Kim promised to work on the Korean nuclear armaments and Mr. Trump made promises to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea has been looking for solutions to bind a formal end in Korea in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must leave his nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax strict trade bans against North Korea.
“The United States insists that ‘nuclear dearmament takes its first place’ and increase pressure by using business prayer to advance, even protesting the declaration to end the war, ” said Ri.
“ It’s just a dream of people who don’t know anything about us thinking that a business prayer can push us.
But the problem is that continued business prayers increase our distrust."
There was no mention of plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader spoke of earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister spoke of three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, the leaders of South Korea in the last five months, adding: “If the party to this nuclear disarmament case was South Korea instead of the United States, this position on nuclear disarmament on the Koreans would not be this issue.”
In spite of this, the concert in the speech of Ri was very different from his speech last year when he said at the General Assembly of the United States that it would be inevitable to aim rockets from North Korea to the mainland of the United States after “the demonic president” Trump called Kim“the fire-wave man ” on a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened to “disrupt” North Korea, but this year he praised Kim of the United Nations for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that much work was still being done and that business prayer had to continue until North Korea had destroyed all its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame for this, saying: “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, stated on Thursday’s Security Council: “The Security Council’s request must continue until complete nuclear disarmament has taken place and confirmed. ”
The Security Council was in agreement to increase trade prayer with North Korea from 2006 in an attempt to close the funding for the Pyongyang nuclear and missile plans.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the General Assembly of S.D. and said after he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times a year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that results had been achieved, but only a few hours later, North Korea condemned him for making “punishable demands.”
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to take down the missiles and nuclear power station if the United States took to “accurate action.”
He said that Kim said that the “equivalent measures” he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and measures aimed at normal relations with Washington.
Students in Harvard take a course at plenty of rest
A new course at the Harvard University has given all students more sleep in an attempt to resist the growing tendency of students to watch and learn all night with the help of caffeine tablets.
A study revealed that students at the best university often know little or nothing at all when it comes to thinking about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and the Women’s Hospital, designed the course and believes it is the first in the United States.
He was given the idea of doing the course after giving a lecture on the effects of lack of sleep on study.
“ At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and asked: “Why do I say this first now, in my final year? ”
She said that no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he said to Telegraph.
The study held for the first time this year explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help study and sports performance and even promote general well - being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of mental health care at Harvard Medical School and the director of the school’s health service, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after learning that students were very sleepless over the week.
The study is an hour - long course, including a number of interactive assignments.
In one section, there is a picture of a room at home, where students click on a cup of coffee, curtains, sports shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how performance in sports can worsen with a lack of sleep, as well as the importance of a good bus for sleep.
In other parts, participants are told how long - term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the school area with interactive signs then encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
“ We know that this will not change the way students behave.
But we feel that they are entitled to know this, just as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that welcomes those who stay awake and learn all night is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and ever - increasing pressure on students meant that sleep shortages were increasing problems.
The assurance that there is enough sleep of good quality should be “hidden weapons ” for students to fight stress, tiredness, and anxiety, he said — even to avoid fatting, for sleep loss increases the call for food for the brain so that the body is constantly in place.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old in chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler to put the course together, but he sat one of the colleagues last year in Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a course for all students at school.
He hopes that the next step will have to ask all students to complete a similar course before they start studying at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm clock, which reminds them to go to sleep, and to wake them up, and keep in mind the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic displays and LED lights, which may confuse the body’s inner clock and lead to trouble falling to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark of Men shoots down Gerrard's men
Rangers were still in trouble at the ground when Stevens Gerrard’s split team had to accept 1-0 losses on Livingston, according to Dolly Menga’s target.
Ibrox wanted to win his first victory on the field after his victory at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team just gave Gerrard's second loss in 18 of his games as manager. The team is now eight points behind Hears, which is at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership division.
Men challenged seven minutes before halftime, and Ranger’s team seemed to lack all inspiration and was never likely to level up.
Rangers are now falling into the sixth place, but Livingston goes up to the third and is only following Hibernian in the goal difference.
Rangers may face further problems after the caller Calum Spence had to be admitted for head injury after any item was thrown into him from the guests ’ whale half.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr away and came to the front of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stuck to the same 11 - year - old Livi, who reached a level of Hearts last week, and he would have been pleased with how well - trained his team overwhelmed the opposition.
Rangers might have been more with the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the ball it reached.
They should have scored just two minutes after the play when the first shipment from Menga came Scott Pitman in front of Allan McGregor's goal, but he shot past.
A long spare from Keaghan Jacobs then ended at Craig Halkett's, but Alan Lithgow, his defense partner shot past the spring pole.
Rangers returned to control the game, but they seemed to live in hope rather than believe in their game in a final third of the game.
Alfredo Morales certainly felt that he should have had hell when a quarter of the game was over, when he and Steven Lawless were talking together, but Judge Steven Thomson referred to the Colombian man’s appeal.
Rangers were only able to take two shots in the first half, but Liam Kelly, former Ibrox, did not have much to do with protecting a skull from Lassana Coolibary and an easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although an opportunity from Livi in 34 minutes had occurred in spite of the fact that the other people had been over, no one can deny that they understood it, but only because of their perseverance.
Rangers failed again to do anything from Jacob's long spare.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm and chose to send to Menga, which then easily challenged.
Gerrard took his advice in half and sent Ryan Kent in instead of Coulibaly, and the switch had an effect as soon as the porter entered Morelos, but Kelly responded quickly and ran forward to close the shot.
Livingston, however, continued to trick the guests into playing just as the game they enjoy playing and Lithgow and Halkett got each long shipment on top of another.
Holt’s team could have increased its leadership in the locusts, but McGregor did well to deny Jacob’s opportunity before Lithgow ran from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, Ranger's deputy, wanted another hell when he and Jacobs collapsed, but Thomson referred it back.
Almanak: The man who invented the Geiger counter
Here comes a page from our calendar “Sunday Morning”: September 30, 1882, and 136 years ago today... This is the day that future historian Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to study and measure radioactivity and this invention eventually led to a device called Geiger.
The geiger meter has taken a firm seat in the scientific world since then, but was also popular in pop culture, for example in the 1950 'Bells of Coronado' film, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in different roles as scientists:
A man: “What in the matter is this? ”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger meter used to detect radioactive materials such as uranium.
When you put this earpin on you, you can hear the effect of the atoms on the stones."
Evans: “It certainly does work now! ”
Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach your immune system to "see" hazardous cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach your immune system to "see" hazardous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to know dangerous cells as part of the treatment
The treatment includes removing immune cells from the patient and changing them to a laboratory.
Then they can see proteins that are common in many cancer cells and are then injected back into the patient.
Test site vaccine has shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months, and the vaccine teaches immune cells to recognise dangerous cancer cells.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient and changing them into a laboratory so that they can see a “see” protein called HER2 that is found in many types of cancer, and then the cells are injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the Institute of Cancer of the United States, Bethesday, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that the vaccine is very effective. ”
HER2 “produces the growth of various types of cancer, ” said Professor Berzofsky, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon.
A similar method in which immune cells are removed from patients and the “known” attack on cancer cells has been effective in the treatment of one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held a long stand for Trump and carried the MAGA hat after the TV show SNL.
That didn't end well
On the occasion of a long talk, he commended Mr Trump, the president of the United States, saying that he would present himself to the president in 2020.
After moving the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, where he carried the Make America Great derhufu, he spoke long against the democrats and repeated his support at Trump.
“ I’ve spoken to white people so often, saying, “How can you like Trump, he’s a racial akater? ”
If I were concerned about racial hatred, I would have long been transferred from the United States," he said.
SNL began with a pin where Hollywood star Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the court committee of the body of elders because of Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation of sexual harassment.
Although the long-lost West was not sent out, the recording of it was put on the public media by Chris Rock's comedians.
Not sure if Rock wanted to make fun of West by printing the tape.
West had also complained to the audience that he had received bad backstage receptions because of his hat.
“ I was put in the enthroned backfield.
They said to me: “Do not go up with this hat.”
They set me up!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, according to news from Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the deep hole? ” and said he would put on his superhero,“ because that means you can’t appoint me to do, so do you want the world to make progress?
Try your love."
His comments were made with a bow from the audience at least two times, and the actors SNL, according to Variaty, seemed ashamed, and one of the participants said to the paper, “There was silence in the studio. ”
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his scene when he sang the song I Love it, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from Candace Turner, a holding group called TPUSA, who said on Twitter: “To one of the bravest souls: TAKEN FOR THE DISCUSSION OF MY MOTHERS. ”
But on Twitter, Karen Hunter, speaking factor manager, said that West was simply being “he himself, and that’s wonderful. ”
“But I chose to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his “listen ”) who I feel supports and spread ideas that are harmful to my society.
He's free.
It's us too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now “a place previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change the name and feet in the footsteps of Diddy, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also been called Snoop Lion and must not be forgotten the music legend Prince vowed, who changed his name in symbol and later called himself the artist previously known as Prince.

A 45 - year - old has been accused of an attempted murder after being stabbed to a restaurant in East Belfast on Tuesday.

Kit Harington, the star of the Crown Games, criticises toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent adventures of HBO, the Crown Games.
The 31 - year - old actor, however, has criticized the situation about the male hero and says that such a role on the screen is often felt by young boys to be tough to gain respect.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes that “one thing went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood in the #MeToo period.
Kit, who recently married his fellow actress from the Crown Games, the 31 - year - old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had “strong opinions ” on how to deal with this issue.
“Persually, I feel at the moment - what has gone wrong with my masculine? ”
“ What have we taught men in their growth, about the problems we see now? ”
Kit believes that TV is partly responsible for increasing the level of toxic manhood, due to a very male person on television.
He continued: “What is inborn, and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel as if they have to be made of a man?
I think it's one of the most important questions of the day - how do we react?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong with young men."
He also admitted during the interview that he would not play in any other Krønkottakter after the series of factors resembled the next summer and said that he had received “a lot of battlefields and horses. ”
As of November, Kit will be remodeled on True West, a picture of Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a movie producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently said that the best thing about playing at the Crown Games was to have met his wife, Rose.
“ I met my wife in these things, that they might give me my future family and my life after that, ” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, Jon Snow's lover, who Kit played in these Emmy prizes.
The couple got married in June 2018, in the country of Lesli’s family in Scotland.
HIV/Ejaculation: China reports a 14% increase in new infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people infected with HIV or AIDS.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
About 40,000 new infections were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new infections were transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
In the past, the HIV virus spread rapidly in some parts of China due to the administration of infected blood.
On the other hand, the number of HIV infected in this way has fallen to almost zero, as Chinese healthcare professionals said at a Yunnan conference.
However, the number of people infected with HIV or AIDS has increased by 100,000 from one year to another.
Sex-induced HIV infection is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Since 1997, homosexuality has not been illegal in China, but there is still much difference between LGBT and LGBT.
As a result of conservative values in the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men having sex with other men eventually marry a woman.
Many infections are caused by inadequate contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised access for all to HIV medicines as part of a plan to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the fact that a staff member has leaked data from the representatives of the Republicans, criticises “hazardous lies” and“ conspiracys”
On Saturday, Mr. Maxine Waters denied the accusation that one of her employees had published personal information to the three Congressmen of the Republican Party on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said that these claims came from “excessive” extremes and Web sites.
“ Lygars, lies, and other terrible lies, ” said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information published contained the addresses and numbers of the U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, who are both from Utah.
The information was published on the Internet on Thursday from an unknown party on Capitol Hill during the hearings at Brett Kavanaugh, a member of the Supreme Court, for the accusations of sexual harassment.
Some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh, the link came.
Holding pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said that the IP numbers identifying the source of the information were connected to the Waters office and published information about one of its employees, according to Capitol Hill information.
“ This irrefutable accusation is completely wrong and pure, ” Waters continued.
“ My boss — what personal information and security are now at risk because of these false accusations — was in no way responsible for this information leak.
This inexcusable accusation is completely wrong and pure lie."
Waters’ statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, including Ara Fleischer, former White House news agent.
“ This denial is full of anger, ” wrote Fleischer.
“ It indicates that she does not have the power to sit on the council.
When someone is accused without cause, do not react with anger.
Opposition must not be shown.
There is no question about the cause of the accusation.
It must be calm and balanced."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, which critics said was too angry at the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the provoking Republic of Waters in the mid - season conference, also said his opinion on Twitter.
“ A big deal if it is true, ” he peed.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had informed “the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities of these untrue claims.
“ We will make sure that the guilty ones are found, ” she continued, “and that they will be brought to justice for all the things that are damaging and dangerous to all my employees. ”
Movie review for Johnny English Strike agin - an escalator film with Rowan Atkinson proves a little bit of power
Now, it has become a habit to look for the Brexit references in all new films where Britain comes to history, and it seems to be true in this resuscitation of Johnny English comic book - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and just woke up to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this candid satire tell us how clearly miserable we are to be a new export facility for the country?
Whether it is or not, Johnny English has been restored to a second time to screw everything up - his name shows above all that he is a creation designed for display in non - English - speaking countries.
He is, of course, a wise secret service official who pretends to have an enchanting personality, but is a small mixture of Clouseau, a dass of Mr Bean, and a small deletion of the man who played one note for the Chariots of Fire at the Opening Festival of Olympic Games in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and mysterious world citizen who Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, where he left everything in a mess.
There's one or two good things in this latest Johnny English movie.
I enjoyed seeing Johnny English walking as a helicopter dressed in a medieval fire, and the helicopter blades were in his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows her brilliance, but the mood seems rather powerless and strange to the surface, especially now that “severer” films such as James Bond and the Mission Impossible images also offer no jokes.
I found the adventure that Johnny English had in not as imaginative and focused as Atkinson's quiet barricades of Mr Beans.
Now, the ongoing basis for the picture is that Britain is in great trouble.
A computer hacker has been able to break into a secret British spy network and unraveled the identity of all British spies, to a great extent for the spy who is on the watch - unfortunately Kevin Eldon is in too little role.
This is the final message for the prime minister, who is proud and controversial and who is in great trouble because of a huge political enemy: Emma Thompson does his best with his role as a person to remind Theresa May, but the script is not up to many fishes for her.
Her counselors tell her that all active spies are in danger and must find someone who had been placed in holy stone.
And there comes Johnny English himself, now head of school at some nice school, but also provides secret instruction on how to be a spy: Here are some funny jokes that English offers at a spy school that reminds of the school of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall at an emergency meeting and meets there Bough, his former long-tired partner, whom Ben Miller plays again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine manager, but in that energy-intensive role, Vicki Pepperdine does not quite let his light shine.
Now, the nightstand that screws up everything in her service, Your Majesty, is back in the barracks and meets Opheliu Bulletovu, who is played by Olgu Kurylenko.
At the same time, the prime minister is that the magic of the enchanting billionaire of technology, who claims to be able to solve the British computer problem, is the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their crash: they light up a fine French restaurant disguised as servants, they cause trouble when they smuggle into Volta's luxury nest, and English turns everything upside down when he tries to use virtual glasses to study the interior of Volta's house.
There is nothing to be saved in that final point, but although the picture is fun and powerful, there are some of the children in it as a whole.
Medium-edged fabric.
And just as with the other Johnny English pictures, I couldn’t help but think: Can British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his abilities?
The labor group denies it's making a four - day work week plan for the British, with the same salary as for five days a week.
The team of workers, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is now considering a radical plan that would allow the British to work for four days a week, but get paid for five.
According to the group, the superiors want to make use of the savings generated by the revolution in artificial intelligence, and they want employees to benefit from one extra day.
In that case, employees could spend three days on weekends, without falling wages.
Sources say that the idea would be "fit" to the group's economic programme and its policy of improving the interests of workers.
The Trade Union Congress Agency has been supporting a four-day reduction in the working week, which has led employees to make use of economic changes.
A senior member of the Workers’ Union said to Sunday Times: “It is estimated that policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
“The change will not take place in one night, but four days’ work week is a goal that is appropriate to the approach of the class to change the economy in the interests of workers and in the overall industry strategy of the class.”
The Workers' Party would not be the first class to support this idea, but the Green Group promised a four-day work week during its election campaign in 2017.
However, the aim is not supported by the Group of Workers as a whole.
The spokesperson of the Workers’ Party said: “The four days of work are not on the group’s policy paper, and the class is not considering introducing it.”
John McDonnell, minister of the shadow Ministry, used the Workers’ Party’s Conference last week to describe his ideas of social revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to regain power from “unknown primers” and“ collection of crops ” companies.
The shadow Minister’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get all their share back, since the Government of the Workers’ Party could put on “departure” by the alleged iniquities.
He has also confirmed plans to set up employees in the executive committees and to make common ownership funds to allow 10 percent of private companies to own their employees, who could receive 500 pounds of them annually in their pocket.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" if the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh might lead them to change their mind.
An investigation by the FBI of the accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has led to at least a week’s delay in the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court, and raises the question whether its findings could have the Republican officials back their support.
In an interview scheduled on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a reporter of the “60 minutes” Republicans and Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked whether the FBI could reveal something that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his college from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“ When the trial began, I said that I was speaking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges were made and asked, “Did you do this? ”
He was determined, firm, undisputed."
Graham’s vote, however, seems unchangeable.
“ I’ve made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, ” he said, “and it takes an amazing charge to change it.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but this I know: Brett firmly denied it,” added Graham, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
“ And everyone named by her name could not confirm it.
This case is 36 years old.
I can't see anything new will change."
What is the International Citizen’s Festival, and has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be held on Saturday in New York, an annual musical event where a series of great stars will appear and have a similar effect; to end poverty worldwide.
This is the seventh year in which the International Citizen Festival is held, and tens of thousands of people will fly to Central Park, not only to listen to music items from among other things Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real goal of the festival to end the pain of poverty by 2030.
The International Citizen’s Festival, which was held in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project, an international battle organization that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of those who fight it.
In order to get a free label on the event (except for those who want to pay for VIP), concerters had to complete various assignments, or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending e-mails to any of the world’s leaders, calling calls, or using other valid means to help draw attention to their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is the festival, now that 12 years are available to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with free concerts really a way to convince people to call for action, or is it just one so-called "intermediate action" - where people feel that they are doing something that matters by signing a list of requirements on the Internet or sending a message on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded over 19 million “operations” from its supporters, calling for many different goals.
It says that these measures helped to bring world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than 35 billion dollars, which will affect lives over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and notifications for its operations, of which at least $10 billion have been invested or collected.
The group estimates that the amount of money collected up to now had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main obligations comes from The Power of Nutrition, a partner of the investment and manager in Britain, who works to “help children enjoy their full enjoyment, ” and promised to give 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help to end malnutrition in the country, after receiving 4700 messages on Twitter from Global Citizens.
“With the support of Britain’s government, sponsors, governments worldwide and international cities like you, we can make the social injustice of the past,” said Tracey Ullmann, representative of The Power of Nutrition to the London audience in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5,000 calls were made for Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
In the list of common questions on the website of the group, one of the questions is: “Why do you think you can end up suffering poverty? ”
Global Citizen replied: “There will be a long and difficult project - sometimes we will fail on a continuous basis.
But, we will reach our goal, like movements fighting for the rights of citizens and the removal of racial separation before us, for we are stronger together.
Among those who appear at the event this year are Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe. The event will be held in New York and the introductions are Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a “blocking” to prevent energy exports to Russia, says Minister for the Interior.
“ If necessary, ” says Dr. Ryan Zinke, U.S. Secretary of State, according to a report from Washington Examiner, “the Washington Navy could use the Navy to prevent the supply of energy in Russia, including the Middle East.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s assistance to Syria, especially where it works at the invitation of the legal government there, was a pretext to explore a new market.
“I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is that they want to do business with energy like in Eastern Europe and its southern part,” he should have said according to sources.
And, according to official announcement, there are ways and methods to resist it.
“The United States can use the Navy to ensure that shipping routes are open and to form obstacles, if necessary, to ensure that the energy from them is not available,” he said.
Zinke addressed a guest meeting at the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity group called itself a “Red Energy Contact Dance ” in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran and said that it was more or less the same.
“ The cost option for Iran and Russia is more and less efficient on energy supplies and to replace them with others,” he said, and said Russia has only one game in memory with an economic environment dependent on fossil fuel.
It follows that Trump's regime wants to increase its exports of natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, public employees in Trump’s administration, including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to stop participating in the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 project to add new energy sources, which Trump says would make Berlin “capture” Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the 11 billion dollars North Stream 2 power supply, which will double the current transport capacity of the pipeline up to 110 billion meters, is only an economic project.
The Russians say that Washington’s strong opposition to the project has simply continued for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the supplies,” said Aleksandr Novak, Russian Energy Minister, after a meeting with Rick Perry, U.S. Secretary of Energy, Moscow, in September.
The state of the United States has been criticized by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industrial organisation in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called upon the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
“I’m very dissatisfied with the fact that our energy supply was shared by outside countries,” said Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting held with Angela Merkel, Germany’s Chancellor, and Vladimir Putin, president of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will “think seriously” about presenting herself to the Presidency in 2020, she says
On Saturday Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said that she would “think seriously” to present herself to the president after the mid - term meetings.
Warren confirmed that she would consider presenting herself to a city meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“ It’s time for women to go to Washington and set up our government, and then a woman also needs to be a leader,” she said, according to a report from The Hill.
“ After November 6th, I will seriously consider offering myself to the office of President.”
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump at the meeting and said that he was going “with the country in the wrong direction.
“ I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy, ” she said.
Warren has been ignorant of his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his appointed Supreme Court Judge.
On Friday, Warren on Twitter said that “we must definitely let the FBI investigate the matter before the vote takes place.”
However, a survey published on Thursday shows that the majority of voters in Warren’s county do not think it should be offered by 2020.
Fifty - eight percent of “likely” voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not offer himself, according to a survey published by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty - two percent claimed to support her offer.
The survey showed more support for the former governor of Deval Patrick, who claimed that 38 percent of them were in favour of his possible offer, and 48 percent claimed to be against it.
Among other popular democrats discussed for possible presidential elections in 2020 were former Vice President Joe Biden, and Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont.
Biden said he would make a public decision in January, according to a report from the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about shock stress disorder Track Palin at the election meeting at Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, was in Iraq for one year after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
“ My son is going through a lot of trouble after coming back, I feel with other families who are affected by shock stress disorder and the spiritual wounds our soldiers return home with, ” she said to the audience at a election meeting for Donald Trump, Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the figs of the room ” and said that her son and other war soldiers“ would be back just differently; they would be hard pressed and wonder if any respect was given to what their companions in the army and the Air Forces and other military units have done for the land. ”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, for trying to prevent the announcement of domestic violence and for the delivery of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, the spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 county and Washington D.C. support the challenge of a new asylum search policy
Eighteen states and Washington are supporting a legal challenge against a new US policy that denies victims who flee walk - or - home violence.
State representatives of the 18th and the city sent a legal report on Friday in Washington to support a policy - protester, according to a report from NBC News.
The full name of the defendant in Grace v. Sessions' lawsuit made by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal policy has not been given up.
She said that her spouse “and his violent sons who were gang members ” used violence, but on July 20, U.S. government staff rejected her application for refuge.
She was put in custody in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries where gang and home violence problems are increasing, and the number of asylum seekers to the United States comes from these countries.
The new asylum seeker policy calls back a decision made by the immigration appeal committee in 2014 to allow unscrupulous immigrants who fled home violence to apply for refuge.
In a statement on Friday, D.C. Karl Racine, D.C., stated that the new policy “dessed decades of national and international law.”
“The laws of the United States require that a decision be made on all requests for refuge based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this rule, ” said the Court Report.
Further, in the report, lawyers said that the policy of refusing entry was harmful to the economy of the United States, claiming that immigrants were more likely to set up a company and “providing important labour. ”
Jeff Sessions, a state attorney, ordered immigration judges to stop giving refuge to a victim who fled home violence and gang violence in June.
“ Those who leave their homeland because of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular community or political review can apply for refuge, ” said Sessions in his communication on the 11th of June.
Healing was never meant to solve all the problems, not even all the serious problems that people manage every day around the world.
A desperate race for survival in Pala, the number of the dead doubles
Conditions are becoming increasingly difficult for survivors.
“ There’s a lot of tension in the air, ” said Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, as she comforted her weak son at the relief center in Pala.
“ Sick cars are constantly bringing bodies here.
There's little clean water."
Residents were seen returning to their debauched homes and searching for their possessions of water to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals were overfilled and damaged after the earthquake, which measured 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who broke back and shoulder, were outside the Pala Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continued intense post-quake.
His eyes were filled with tears when he told how he found the earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save ourselves.
I pressed up to the temples, I think," said Haris to Associated Press and said that his family had been in town to go to a wedding.
“ I heard my wife call for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Secretary of State blames China for "seizures" with "exploitations"
A week after the publication of a four - page advertisement in a United States newspaper in China to discuss mutual business benefits between the two countries, U.S. Secretary of State in China Peking accused of using American media to spread propaganda.
The president of the United States of America, Donald Trump, spoke last Wednesday about the Chinese magazine’s announcement in Des Moines Register, which is the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accused China of trying to get involved in the U.S. Congress of November 6, China.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing wanted to get involved in the U.S. Congress markets what official U.S. agents told Reuter’s news office that it was a new stage in a growing campaign from Washington to exert pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are engaged in an ever - increasing trade war, with new customs duties on both countries’ import goods.
Chinese and American experts say that China’s vengeance interpreters early in the business war were designed to harm emigration in states like Iowa, who supported Trump’s Republican group.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador of China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, which state carries out a lot of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers, and companies.
Branstad, in his submission to his opinion, stated in his Sunday newspaper Des Moines Register, that “China is now increasing its persecution by publishing propaganda ads in our own free media. ”
“ By spreading its propaganda, China’s government is taking advantage of the loving freedom of speech of the United States and our free media by publishing a costly advertisement in Des Moines Register, ” said Branstad in her article.
“ At the back of the day, ” he wrote, “a few protests can be found in magazine booths on the streets of Beijing, and no true reflection can be found on the various views that China might have on the worrying economic policy of China, where the media are firmly under the heel of the Chinese Communist Party. ”
He added that “one of the largest news magazines in China avoided the offer to publish ” his article, but he did not say what magazine it was.
Experts warn that the Republicans are making female voters suspect them before mid-term meetings with the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned against negative reactions, especially from women, in the next mid - term study, because many Republicans have supported and defended Brett Kavanaugh, a designated Supreme Court judge, who has been accused of sexual harassment.
Very strong feelings have been around this issue, and most of the Republicans have already publicly shown that they wanted to start voting.
“ These things cannot be backed up,” said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Institute Maxwell School at Syracuse University, at The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that in the last minute of an investigation at the FBI, in order to calm down the voters, Jeff Flake, the Senator General of the Arizona Republic.
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow and not November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, headmaster and spokesperson for the liberal group MoveOn, Friday, according to Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, the Protestants sang “November approaching!” when protesting at the assemblies of the elders, the Republicans who ruled the committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh’s appointment, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
“ The interest and zeal of the voters will go out of hand, ” said Stu Rothenberg, independent of political intelligence, at the news page.
“ People will say that the interest was already great and it is true.
But he could be greater, especially among women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who don't like the president, but rarely choose."
The reporters predicted a setback if the Republicans were to be pressured to confirm Kavanaugh, even for the testimony of Ford, where she described her accusations of sexual harassment.
“ This has become a big mess for the Republican Party, ” said Michael Still, former member of the Republican Party’s National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
“The note is not just about the vote of the committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is allowed to sit on the bench, it is also about how the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have dealt with it,” said Guy Cecil, president of Priorities of the United States, a group helping to vote on the Democrats, at the news station.
On the other hand, the Americans seem to disagree with who should believe after a witness from both Ford and Kavanaugh, and the small majority support the latter.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely believed or probably believed the Ford testimony, while 35 percent claimed to believe or likely the Kavanaugh testimony.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said that they computerd Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied to their testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the Flake call, the FBI is now investigating the accusations that Ford made and from at least one other woman, Deborah Ramirez, according to a Guardian report.
Ford witnessed the oath before the committee of elders last week and said that Kavanaugh attacked her when she was 17 years old and that he was under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says that Kavanaugh had her sexual organs in front of her when they were both at a party at Yale University in the 1990 ’ s.
The man who invented the Internet has plans to start a new internet to fight against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the Internet, is going to set up a brittle company to fight against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the technical legend, Inrupt, is a company built in Solid, an open-ended facility of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which people have access to what information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said in a joke that the intent behind the Inrupt was “the world power.”
"We have to do this now," he said about the brittle business.
"This is a historic moment."
The program uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own “personal online data store” or POD.
It contains a list of contacts, task lists, calendars, music collections, and other personal and work - related devices.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and all simultaneously.
The unique thing about the personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user who can get access to what information.
The company calls it “personally powerful force by using data.”
According to John Bruce, the manager of the company, the idea is that the company provides resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Today, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security facility purchased by IBM, several programmers appointed as a contractor for the project, and a volunteer group of programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world could create their own independent software using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not dealing with “Facebook and Google about whether or not to initiate a complete change that would put their current business model on their heads in one night.
“We don’t ask them for permission. ”
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published on Saturday at Media that Inrupt had “the objective of creating energy in business and an ecosystem that helps protect the honesty and quality of the new web based on Solid.”
Berners-Lee replaced the network in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even while he comes Inrupt on his feet.
"I'm full of optimism for the next network period," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: The Priest and Master of the Victorian Cross of World War I
The only English priest to be honored with the Victorian cross during the first world war that a soldier has been hailed in his hometown 100 years later.
On September 29, 1918, Father Bernard Water, who held a post in the military, received the cross at the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later, a sniper killed him, and he was never told that he had received the highest honor of the British Army.
Two of his granddaughters exposed a memorial to him on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that it was “deep figuratively ” that the monument was exposed exactly 100 years from the success of his grandfather’s glory.
According to the London Gazette magazine, on September 29, 1918, Van under the command of the Colonel led over the Canal de Saint-Quentin Canal “through a very thick fog and under a hard shot from cannons and machine guns.”
Later, he ran to the line of fire and, with “very bravery,” led the line forward before attacking one of his team’s cannons and vanquishing three soldiers.
On October 4, 1918, only a month before the end of the war, under the rule of the Colonel was killed by a German shooter.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather’s heroic pursuits were “one thing I could never do, but something that makes you humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Water, also laid a flower jar after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said that he was “a great privilege to participate in the parade, ” adding that“ the daughters of a true hero are shown with the support that so many show."
MMA fans woke up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead got to see Gurra pig
Just imagine, having woken up all night to see the crowd of Bellator 206, just to be denied to see the main event.
The program included 13 San Jose fights, of which six were on the main program, and they were on live broadcast all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 o’clock in the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, the British audiences had an unexpected event when the broadcast changed into Gutru Gris.
Some were dissatisfied when they woke up all night to watch the battle.
One fan on Twitter declared the exchange to the children’s material as “any sort of sick joke. ”
“In accordance with official rules, the subject was not qualified for audiences at 6:00 p.m. so they had to switch to childhood,” said Dave Schwartz, Vice President of Marketing and Communication for Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Gurra grish, yes."
Scott Coker, director of Bellator, said they would go over their time plans and take the audiences in Britain into the account in the future.
"I think when I think about the reflection we could probably solve this," said Coker.
“ But it is six o’clock in the morning on Sunday there, and we can’t resolve it until Sunday to our time, which is Monday with them.
But we're working on this.
Believe me, when the broadcast was replaced, many text messages were sent back and forth, and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to fix this, we thought this was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a public problem.
I can promise you this won't happen the next time.
We limit the evening to five battles instead of six, as usual, but we tried too much and went out of our way.
This is an unfortunate condition."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “disadvantage” due to sexuality
According to Olympian Dr. Tom Daley, who claims to have felt displeasure toward other people in growing up because of his sexuality, he was encouraged to succeed.
The 24 - year - old Daley said that he did not realize that “he was different from others” until he went to high school."
In the Desert Island Discs radio program on Radio 4 with Lauren Lavener, Daley said that he spoke of the rights of homosexuals to give others “hope. ”
He also said that his parental role reduced his interest in winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the usual member in charge, has taken a few months off because of illness.
Daley was able to choose the first part of Laverne and said that he felt that he was “a smaller man ” than everyone else when he was a child because“ it was not accepted in society to like both boys and girls.”
“ Until today, ” he said, “these feelings of feeling low and different have given me the strength and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “one thing, ” he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when he finally came to know his sexuality.
Two times the Olympic Bridge has been a supporter of LGBT and used its participation in the Commonwealth games in Australia to summon more nations to legislate with homosexuality.
He said that he was hearing because he felt lucky to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to give hope to others.
The World Champion tripled the fact that he “was surprised” to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who first met in 2013.
The Oskar Prize winner, 20 years older than he, married Daley earlier, saying that the difference in age had never been a problem.
“When you go through so much at a young age ” - but he participated in his first Olympics 14 years of age and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find peers who had experienced similar success and difficulties.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Dalley, and Daley said that his “all perceptions of life ” had been suppressed.
“ If you had asked me last year, everything was about winning a gold prize, ” he said.
“ Know what, it’s more important things than the gold prize for the Olympic Games.
Robbie is my Olympic gold prize."
His son is baptized in the head of Robert, his father who died in 2011, 40 years old, after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was whether they had received their tickets for London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“ I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row, ” he said.
“ I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until his breath stopped, and he was left to admit at last that he wasn’t invincible, ” he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze prize.
“ I only knew that I had dreamed of this all my life, to dive in front of the viewers at home at the Olympic Games; there is no better feeling,” he said.
It was also inspired by the choice of the first song - Proud after Heather Small - which had given him inspiration for the Olympics and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m. to a British local time.
Mikkelson in a bad shape and was put on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American man Phil Mickelson will appreciate Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to find his old beats again so that he doesn't think about bad memories.
Mikkelson, who plays in the race for the 12th time, which is appreciated, was left on the bench after the decision of President Jim Furyk for the four - ball - and - four competitions on Saturday.
Instead of being the centre of the Hasar, as he has been so often before the United States, the day was divided by five times the master between being a cheerleader and practicing the games on the field in hopes of correcting what is wrong with him.
Mikkelson, 48 years old, was never the one who shot straight with the hangover, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National Golf Field, where the longings often punish for bad shots.
And not enough that the golf field is a big challenge in itself, but has to compete against Frances Molinari, winner of the British Open, in the ninth game on Sunday. Molinari is with the new Tommy Fleetwood team and together they have won all four of their games this week.
If the four - stage Americans take the first of 12 solo games to a good start, they could play Mickelson’s game.
Furyk declared trust in his own man, but he could hardly say much more.
“ He fully understood the role he had today, clapped my back and took hold of me and said he would be ready tomorrow, ” said Furyk.
“ He has much confidence.
He's at the famous palace, and he's been so much better for the past and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I saw more for myself, but that's how it ended, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everybody else."
Mikkelson will beat Nick Fallo's record in a number of games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a process in the Ryder Cup, which has never reached exactly as high as other achievements in his file.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 loses, and 7 doubles, but Furyk said that his presence had a certain vague effect on the team.
“ He’s funny, he’s sarcasm, he has fun making fun of people, and it’s great to have him in the team room, ” he explained.
“ I think the younger players liked to tease him too this week, and it was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just the golf game."
Thomas Bjorn, President-in-Office of the European Union knows that a great advance can quickly disappear
From the experience, European President Thomas Bjorn knows that a good lead for the last day of the individual race in the Ryder Cup can easily change into unpleasant experiences.
In 1997, the Dane first played a game in Valderrama, where side by side under the command of the leader Seve Ballesteros had five points ahead of the Americans, but he just achieved victory at the end with the lowest possible score, with 141⁄2-131⁄2 victory.
“Man constantly reminds us that we had a lot of advance in Valderrama, we had a lot of advance in Brookline where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, but just right then,” said Bjorn, who is seen here in the picture, after watching the 2018 vintage, works 5-3 both on Friday and Saturday and takes the lead 10-6 at Le Golf National well.
History will show me and everyone in the team that it's not over.
We'll do all the work tomorrow.
Let's go do everything right.
This has not been completed until all the scores are on the tablet.
We have our goal, and it's trying to win this cup, we're focusing on it.
I've always said this, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we're very conscious of our other team-best golfer in the world."
Bjorn was delighted with how his players had stood in a difficult field and added: “I never go out of this to myself.
Tomorrow's gonna be different.
Tomorrow it is the performance of the individuals that matters, and that is another thing.
It's great to play with a partner when everything's going well, but when you play one, you try every man's talent as a golfer.
It is the message that must be sent to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and he also has to play his best game himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, will strive for his players to do better in individual games than with partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points of four.
Furyyk himself has experienced both sides of this great transition on the last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brookline but ended up losing when Europe carried out the “power of Medinah.”
“ I remember every fucking word, ” he replied, “how Ben Crenshaw, the president of 1999, had encouraged his players to continue last day.
“ We have to play 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start fast as happened in Brookline and Medinah.
As the creep grows closer to building up, it exerts a lot of pressure on the game that is in the middle.
We ordered our players according to it and let them play as we feel we'll be doing best tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defense and against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half of the games.
“ I chose these players in this row because I think they’re going all the way through, ” said Bjorn about his choice of players in the individual competition.
A new German battleship is being postponed again
The latest German Navy ships should have been built in 2014 to replace an old battleship from the Cold War period, but it will not be ready until the first year of next year for a broken system and an ever - increasing cost, according to local news reports.
The building of the “Rheinland-Palatinate”, the leadership of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the sources of the military spokesman who spoke to the Die Zeit magazine.
The ship was supposed to have been taken into service by the Navy in 2014, but serious problems after the launch of the mission.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to replace the Bremen class ships that have arrived in their years.
They should be equipped with a more powerful cannon, numerous anti-aircraft and marine missiles, as well as low radar infrared and sound signals.
Other important features are longer use times - the latest ships should be possible for up to two years away from their hometowns.
On the other hand, a constant delay means that these ships of the latest type - which are said to enable Germany to show its strength at sea - will be obsolete when they are finally taken into account, says Die Zeit.
The F125 army came to the news last year when the German army officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss the drop in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons behind the divorce, but the German media spoke of a number of women seriously “flaws in software and hardware” that would render the battleship useless if it were sent to a military campaign.
Software deficiencies were particularly important because Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be managed by 120 men's crew, which is half the size of Bremen class ships.
It was also shown that the ship was too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the capacity of the Navy to make improvements in the future.
The 7,000 tons of “Rheinland-Palatinate” ships are estimated to be twice the weight of ships similar to those used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from faults in hardware, the cost of the whole project - including training - is beginning to cause problems.
It is said that he reached EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), but originally it was supposed to be EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems that affect the latest ships are particularly important in view of the warning that the German superiors at sea are decreasing.
Earlier this year, Mr. Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the German Defence Committee, acknowledged that the Navy was actually becoming a “catalyst with a functioning ship.”
The officer said that the problem had spread over time, for older ships had been taken out of service, but no ships were in their place.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg orders could be taken into use by the Navy.
The National Trust Nature Protection Association is spying on the secret life of the leather bats
A new study conducted in the highlands of Scotland aims to find out how bats use the landscape when fishing for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will help guide future nature conservation operations.
The study, which scientists at the National Trust for Scotland nature conservation organization will monitor different kinds of leather stains in the Inverewe landscapes in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be installed at key locations around the site to monitor the behavior of the leather trays over the period.
NHS and volunteer staff will also be on surveillance trips with handheld senses.
Experts will track down all the recordings to find out the frequency of the calls made by the bats, and what kind do what?
A map of farmland and report will then be published to produce an accurate picture of their geographical behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a nightcaping counselor for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important type of housing for the bats and how they are used by each type.
This information will help to determine the benefits of management of rural areas, for example by creating meadows and how best to maintain forest land for bats and other related species.
During the last century, the number of bats has decreased considerably in Scotland and all over the United Kingdom.
They are at risk from construction and development projects that affect their nests and reduce habitats.
Windmills and lights can also lead to risks, including fly - paper paper and certain chemical treatments on construction materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their ears do much better than their eyes when it comes to catching prey because they are used to fishing at night.
They used high - tech mining techniques to locate insects and objects on their flight path.
NTS, responsible for maintenance of 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
In the organization, ten experts who carry out regular inspections, nest surveys, and sometimes rescue operations are involved.
The organization has even set up the first and one of Scotland’s bats at the Threeave ranch in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of the ten Scotland’s bat types have homes.
David Thompson, manager of the ranch, says he is a perfect area for them.
“ The area here at Treave is great for bats, ” he said.
“ We have old buildings, plenty of grown trees, and lots of good living areas.
But there is still a lot of ignorance about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to understand what they need to do."
He stressed the importance of checking bats before maintaining accommodations, since possible accidental destruction of one nest can kill up to 400 women’s bats and young people and destroy all the bats in the area.
Bats are protected and it is forbidden to kill them, attack or interfere, or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have much to learn about bats, and we don’t know how well many of their species are going. ”
Ronaldo denies the accusations of rape when lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called accusations against him about the rape of “fascist news ” and says that people want to“ draw attention to themselves ” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which reported the accusations.
The army of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rapeing an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is said to have paid her $375,000 left for the incident, according to Der Spiegel's report on Friday.
A few hours after the charges were made, Ronaldo, 33 years of age, said in Instagram Live video on 142 million of his followers that they were “fascist news. ”
“ No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today is false news," said the world champion five times the camera.
“ These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and everything's fine," added the player to smiling.
According to Reuter’s news firm, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the accusations that they have called “unconceived disclosure of suspicions relating to private life. ”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that Ronaldo would demand a replacement for “the pain of the same amount and severity of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years. ”
The alleged incident has taken place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and the casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he should have raped her in the rectum, according to documents submitted for Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell on his knees and told her that he was a “99 percent good man” who fell into temptation because of “1 percent."
The documents say that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex but that they had consented to both.
Mayorga claims that she went to the police to take pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but finally agreed to settle outside the courtroom because she was “deaf of revenge ” and was concerned about becoming“ debased in public. ”
She now says that she wants to quit her sweets because she is still in shock after an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was near going to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape was due to take place, and this summer he went over to Italian giant Juve with 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain would “see for ever” to lose car manufacturers
Britain would ‘ regret it forever’ if it lost its position as an international leader among car manufacturers after Brexit, says Minister of Business Greg Clark.
He added that it was “anxious” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a contract, the company would temporarily cease production in its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a contract," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effect of the delay in the border would be if Brixit, without a contract, was to be a reality.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactured Toyota Auris and Avensis cars, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European Union countries.
“My opinion is that if Britain falls out of the EU by the end of March, we will see production sites in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concern about EU exit without the agreement on the conduct of inter-country trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that it will close its Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is that what car manufacturers say is a chain risk if Brexit becomes a reality without a contract.
Toyota’s manufacturing line is based on the reception of “the last moment”, where parts are delivered every 37 minutes from the supply of both British and EU cars produced after booking.
If Britain withdraws from the EU without a contract on 29 March, there could be some disruption to the borders that the industry believes can lead to delays and lack of participation.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's store in his factory in Derbyshire, said the company, and therefore the production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that the Chequers Program Theresa May for Future Relations with the EU “was designed specifically to prevent these views from the border.”
"We must have a contract, we want the best deal that will enable us not only to enjoy success in today, but as an opportunity that we can use," he said on the BBC Radio 4 radio show.
“ The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we must be able to continue in a very effective way.
Toyota could not tell us how long their production would be stopped, but warned that to a longer time, increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnston for 24 years and is a confidant of the trade union at the factory, said that his colleagues were ever more concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs go away, they never come back.
The president of the government said: “We have presented a detailed and comprehensive plan for our future relations with the EU.”
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein might be delayed again, according to the White House.
The White House announced on Sunday that an important meeting between Donald Trump and Dr. Rosenstein, assistant attorney of the state, could be “restrained again about a week,” now the dispute with Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court judge, continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor investigating Russian conflicts in elections, connections between Trump’s and Russia’s assistants, and possible obstacles to the progress of justice by the President.
For many weeks, history has been taking place in Washington as to whether Trump will put an assistant attorney and thus put Mueller’s independence in jeopardy.
Earlier that month, the New York Times said that Rosenstein had discussed bringing up a recording device to settle talks with Trump and the possibility of questioning the president by using the 25th additional section of the constitution.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
But last Monday, he visited the White House, among other things, news that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, then with the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that he “does not want to run Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed so that he was not at the same time as the hearing of the judicial committee of the body of elders, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who has accused him of sexual harassment, witnessed both.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week - long investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which delayed the vote of the Senate.
Sarah Sander, Trump’s media representative, was on the program Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein, she said: “The date has not been set for him, it could be this week, and I think it is possible that he will be postponed for another week because of everything else that is going on at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and it's always my pleasure to inform the media."
Some reporters disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The Participant Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not because of the dissatisfaction that TV reporters had “visited people, ” but she said:“ I don’t disagree with the fact that they have virtual people. ”
She then indicated that a direct relationship between Trumps and the media would increase.
“ The president answers more questions to the media than any other president has done before, ” she said, without referring to the authority, “We have reviewed these figures. ”
“ If the media have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, ” said Sanders, “it is much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of it, and you've seen us do a lot of it in the last few weeks, and it's gonna take place in the media, when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or media meetings with other visitors who visit him.
Media meetings with him alone are rare.
The president may have shown why in New York this week, when he displayed unrestrained and timed behavior in front of a group of reporters.
Minister of Health writes EU staff within the health system in Scotland for the concern of Brexit
The Minister for Health has written to EU staff working within the health system in Scotland (NHS Scotland) to express their gratitude for the nation and to wish it to continue to work after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months of leaving the EU.
The Swedish Government has already promised to meet the cost of the job authorisation applications for EU staff working within the public service sector.
In his letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “For the summer, discussions between Britain and the EU are ongoing due to statements and decisions are expected in the autumn.
The British Government has also worked to prepare if there is no contract possible.
I know this must be a lot of uncertainty for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the work of all the employees, regardless of their nationality.
EU and non-EU partners have valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves the work of health services and is beneficial to the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is indeed your home, and we want you to stay here very much."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a lineman for Tennessee State Tigers, had to undergo emergency surgery after having had a head injury to the 31-27 team of Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, as reported by Mike Organ, Tennessee magazine.
Dr. Rod Reed, Sergeant Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury had occurred shortly before a half.
“ He came to the sideline and fell down there, ” said Reed.
Coaches and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on a bar and carried for further inspection.
An agent from Tennessee State told Chris Harris, a radioman WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had completed surgery at the hospital in Vanderbilt.
Harris added that there was “no information about the type or severity of the impact yet” and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the accident took place.
Abercrombie, who is last year at school, plays his first period with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five of them all on Saturday before he left, which raised the total number of cars he had up to 18.
Foreign buyers will be robbed of higher stamps when buying real estate in Britain
Foreign buyers will be robbed of higher stamp fees when buying real estate in the UK. The surplus will be used to help the homeless, according to a new plan of the National Team.
The action will do away with Corby's campaign to attract young voters
Increased stamping fees will be imposed on non-taxors in the United Kingdom
Government funds are estimated to raise £120 million a year — to help the homeless.
Theresa May will report this today.
The operation will be considered an attempt to put an end to the campaign of Jeremy Corbyn in order to attract young voters by promising accommodations at a more affordable price and taxing insurgents more.
Subjects and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom have to pay higher stamp fees, and the excess will go in government operations to help the homeless.
The increase - which is in addition to the current plunger fee, including the increase that was made two years ago in an extra home and a mortgage purchase for rent - could be up to three percent.
Government funds estimate that the increase will bring up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new buildings in London are bought by foreign partners, which is a result of price increases and makes it harder for those who want to buy real estate for the first time to enter the market.
Many chemical areas in the country, especially in the capital city, have become “dream cities ” because of the number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamps to help other young people get their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by buying land but not using them, and urged May to abandon household quotas on a suitable basis to fix the “housekeeping tables ” of Britain.
Mr Corbyn has reported a number of significant improvements to housing, including rent monitoring and the end of rentals without cause.
He also wants to give more authority to build a new home.
Theresa May said: “In the past, I said that I would devote myself to the restoration of the British dream during my first period — that each new generation should enjoy better quality of life.
And that includes fixing our unutilized property market.
Britain's door will always open those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it cannot be right for foreign partners to be as easy as companies with foreign headquarters to buy homes and for British people.
For many, the dream of their own house is far too far off, and the reproach of the houseless is yet too real."
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to train Scotland"
Jack Ross, Hiderland’s coach, says that it is his “first goal ” to become Scotland’s Coach sometime.
This 42-year-old Scott now enjoys the challenge of blowing a new life at the North-East Club, which is now in third place in the first division, three points from the top.
He moved to Sunderland for the summer after coming back to St. Mirren in the Scottish Superstance Department during the last season.
“ I wanted to play for my people as a player.
I got hurt on my knee and that's it,' said Ross in an interview with Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
“ But I grew up watching Scotland often in Hampden with my father as a child, and there’s always something that has pulled me back.
But that opportunity would only be possible if I was able to successfully train the department."
The predecessors of Ross who coach Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of the Alloa Athletic Club said he felt no fear of following in the footsteps of such famous names at such a large club, but he had previously rejected training stations at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“ As I am, I will measure my success by thinking, “Can I bring this club back to the high school? ”
This club is definitely at home in the prime department because of his structure and position," he said.
“ It’s not easy to get him there, but I’d probably only consider myself successful here if I came back up there with the club.”
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a period as an auxiliary coach for Dumbarton and 15 months as part of a coach for Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from falling to the third division, and changed St. Mirren, who was about to fall to the division, to the branchmaster the next season.
Ross claims to be more confident now than he was ever in his acting career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkrk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“ It was probably a real time gap, ” he says about the time when he became a coach of Alloa.
“ I really believed that the coaching work was right for me, even more than playing.
It sounds amazing, because I was doing well, I had a decent income from it and enjoyed a meticulous success.
But changes can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot every week.
I still go through it with stress and pressure from the job, but the coach service just seems to be right for me.
I always wanted to train, and now I do. I've never felt better about myself in all my adult years."
The whole interview can be heard on Sunday, September 30, at Radio Scotland, between 12 a.m. and 1 p.m., at the British placetime.
The best time for beer is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays, according to a poll
The heat exchange rate in the summer has been very rewarding for British bars that have a blaze, but the pressure on restaurants has increased.
Pop and bar sale increased by 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurant sales decreased by 4.8 per cent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, from the business counselor company CGA, who summarized the figures, said: “The continued sunshine and unexpected success of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to June, when barsala increased by 2.8 percent, except what the hosts sold even less.
Salan fell by 1.8 percent at restaurants in June and got worse again in July.
Puppys and bars, which aim primarily at the sale of drinks, stood the longest with more upsurgence while restaurants went down.
Men who sold food also had difficulty in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out to drink.
Drinks are to be sold to poppers and barbs increased by 6.6 percent before the month, but food salesmen decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, from the diagnostic company RSM, said: “These results remain on the swing that we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of important social events or sports events are still the biggest factors in the retail sector.
It is not surprising that food business groups still have difficulties, although sales reductions of 4.8 percent between months are particularly painful over continued cost pressure.
This long and hot summer could hardly come at a worse time for food sales, and only time will reveal whether a temperate temperature, as we have had in August, will improve the situation."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened sites, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow openings.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the surveillance company with sales in the British pub bar- and restaurant store, collects and analyses data from 47 business groups, with a combined roll-over of 9 billion pounds and is the industrial benchmark for the geir.
One of five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents.
One in five children, down to 11 years of age, has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to the results of a survey.
A survey of 20,000 students showed an increase in the “gervi Insta” pages.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual material
Twenty percent of students say they have a “numbered” account they show parents
One in five children, down to 11 years of age, produces secret accounts on the social media that they keep secret for adults.
A survey of 20,000 students showed a large increase in the “gervi Insta ” account - a reference in the Instagram website.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual material.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a pure “total” account to show parents, as well as a secret account.
One mother, who fell on her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret website, found a youth who urged others to “sacrifice me. ”
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and HMC showed that 40 percent of children aged 11-18 had two accounts, and half of them admitted to holding private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: “It is a concern that so many youths are tempted to create an area on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them. ”
Eilith Doyle will be the Scottish Athletic’s “Red of Sporters ”
Eilith Doyle has been appointed by the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual General Meeting of the Government.
Doyle is the happiest free sport woman in Scotland and Ian Beatie, the chairman of the committee said that the nomination was a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from its extensive international experience in the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys a great deal of respect within sports communities in Scotland, Britain, and internationally, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would make a lot of money to get it on the committee, ” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I’m very interested in speaking on behalf of athletes and I hope that I can work on my part and help to lead the sports ahead in Scotland. ”
The U.S., who worked among ants 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, while a total of four Olympic gold, and now a regular person in the BBC, was paralysed after a transient ischaemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would reveal whether I would like to be compared to how much.
This has been a hard job, but I’ve usually done my best, learned to walk again, and do sports practice today!
Thank you for your encouragement!"
A breast pump advertisement that compares with cows produces a network conflict
Companies manufacturing breast - pump are now reported on the Internet because of advertising that carries lactating mothers to cows that are milked.
The company Elvie published a custom advertisement to highlight what is said to be “the first silent breast pump in the world that can be carried out outside of it”. The advertisement is inspired by music videos and is to display the freedom that the new pump provides to mothers who are breast - fed.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay, and we cook a song with lyrics such as: “Yes, I milk, but you see no tail on me” and “If you didn’t notice it, it’s not a Jew but my breasts.”
The attachment continues: “Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I pump milk from the jingles. ”
However, the advertisement that appeared on the Facebook page of the company has led to online publicity.
The video has a 77,000 audiences and hundreds of comments, and it has received a dissenting reaction from the audience, which says many people that it boasted of the “crying ” of the milk industry.
“ A very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just as we do, they have to become calfy and bear to produce milk, unless the calves are taken from them only a few days after they are born," said one reference.

Another observer wrote: “In fact, it is difficult for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added: “This advertisement is completely out of line with time.”
Others came to protect the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she was part of the song “a little bit. ”
“ I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought this if I had a baby.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping milk out of me.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
It's a genius," wrote one of the audiences.
Another said: “It’s a fun advertisement that is directed to mothers who pump milk (often at work or in a toilet) and feels like “cubes. ”
It is not an advertisement that commends or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the advertisement, the women ’s group shows that they all danced with the breast pumps hidden in their breast care.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is that many women say that they feel like cows when they pump milk.
However, the Elvie pump is perfectly silent, has no wires or wires, and fits comfortably into a bra, which allows women to move, hold their child, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, a co - owner and boss of Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is so revolutionary that she understood a prominent presentation that would attract publicity.
By being like women to cows, we wanted to direct the cast light to breast - pumping and all of her challenges, and we even showed in a fun and familiar way how much freedom the new pump would give.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump's been in the news.
At London’s fashion week, two children were presented to the designer Marta Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved quietly to a camp near the Texas border
The number of immigration bars in custody has increased suddenly, even though the number of those crossing the border has remained almost the same every month.
Usually, the foster parents have been unregistered immigrants themselves, and they have been afraid to put their chances of remaining in the country at risk, by offering themselves to foster a child.
The risk increased in June, when the public authorities announced that possible foster parents and other adults in the home had to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration control.
Last week, Director Matthew Albence of the immigration and customs authorities witnessed in front of the Senate and said that his organization had arrested a number of people who applied for the birth of a single child.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not in a criminal record.
“ Nearly 80 percent of those who are either fosterives or in a home that fosters children are illegal in the country, and much of them are illegal immigrants on a criminal record.
“ Therefore, we continue to search for their individuals, ” said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to improve the speed of their children’s affairs, representatives announced new rules requiring some of the children to appear in court within a month after they were placed in custody, rather than after 60 days of the previous deadline, by personnel working in the field.
Many of them will be present through a video meeting, rather than in their own personality, to give evidence to their legal position before judges in immigration matters.
The children who are condemned as unfit for entry are sent out of the country quickly.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent or escape attempts, according to the locals and reports published by the system over the past few months.
A spokesperson said that these problems were even more likely in a larger institution, such as Tornillo, since no one is likely to notice that a child is having trouble because of the number of them.
They added that the transfer of children to their tents without giving enough time to prepare them spiritually or to say good - bye friends could increase the shock that many of them are already dealing with.
Syria says the United States, France, and Turkey “strengthening back immediately”
Mr. Walid al-Moualem, Foreign Minister, also said in his speech to the General Assembly of the United States that Syrian refugees should return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays the role of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign troops were illegal in Syria, under the false assumption that they fought against terrorism, and that “they will be treated accordingly. ”
“ They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions, ” he said at the council.
Moualem firmly claimed that “the war against terrorism was almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have had to flee their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred struggle until we cleanse all Syrian territories ” of both terrorist groups and“ all illegal aliens. ”
The United States has about 2000 soldiers in Syria, where most of them train and advise both Curmanian troops and Syrian Aröbs who fight against the President of Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war - torn country.
On the subject of refugees, Moualem said that circumstances are good enough to return, and he taught “some Western countries ” to“ spread a senseless fear ” that encouraged refugees to stay away.
“ We have called on international society and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return, ” he said.
“ They make politics from something that should be purely humanitarian. ”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funding for reconstruction in Syria unless the political agreement exists between Assad and the resistance to end the war.
The British S.D. says that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up an area of neutrality at the last great dedication of the resistance has created an opportunity to continue political dialogue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a major attack by the Syrian troops, supported by the Russians, in the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had “a definite final period” and expressed the hope that military action would target Jihadis, including the fighters from the Nusra Front, who are connected to Al-Qaeda, and that they would“ be destroyed.”
The Staff de Mistura, Secretary of State, hopes to be able to come in the first meetings with a new committee, composed of members of the government and the opposition, to prepare a constitution for Syria after the war and to provide the street for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee, and said that her work should be limited to “crossing the existing government’s regulations, ” and warned against any intruder.
Reasons for Trump's going to win another election period
According to that argument, Mr Trump would win the re-competitions in 2020, unless the charges and scandals end his presidential career, as many liberal observers are likely to hope for.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end of the presidential career ever! ”
At present, the audience has no sign of fatigue.
Since 2014, ratings at the best time have more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN, with almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million audiences at the best time, which is an increase from 1.7 million audiences four years ago, according to Nielsen, and a feature of MSNBC, “The Rachel Maddow Show” has peaked at up to 3.5 million audiences on important news nights.
“ It’s a fire that people are attracted to, because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the member of the ABC drama factor “Designed Survivor” about a member of the government who will be president after the Congress House is destroyed in attack.
Nell Scovell, an experienced columnist and writer of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has a different conjecture.
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the elections in 2016.
The cab driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?
“ He said, “Because he makes me laugh, ” said Miss Scovell to me.
There's fun in the mess.
On the other hand, unlike television, stories from Washington could determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether the families of immigrants can be united and the health of the global economy.
Only those audiences who enjoy the greatest privileges can afford to stop watching.
And yet this is more than being an enlightened citizen when you watch over the sixth time on a group of experts reasoning the use of Bob Woodwards on “the very near” sources for their book“ Fathers,” or $15,000 jacket from the ostrich that Paul Manafor wore (“the garment that is fed with pride, ” said Washington Post) and the consequences of the accurate biological description of Stormy Daniels on Mr. Trump.
At least I'll never see Super Mario again.
“The end of what he does dislikes you to feel like a reality factor, is that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, manager Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the "Pawn Stars", when he discussed the employee feat in Trump's exhibition and daily changes in history thread (e.g. starting a fight with N.F.L. and commendation for Kim Jong-U).
You can't miss one thing, or you lose your desire.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss, 26 degrees of temperature and sunshine were outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he stayed indoors and watched MSNB while he picked up CNN.
He could not tear himself away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to witness before the Committee of the Civil Service, and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“ I remember when we were creating all these crazy things in the old days, and people said, “This is the beginning of the end of Western civilizations,” said Mr. Fleiss to me.
“ I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out that people were right. ”

Money outside of the middle season's most recent elections
It is not surprising that the 17th quarter of Pennsylvania sees the money flowing, thanks to reorganization in the field of interest, which led to two representatives competing for the same seat.
The newly reorganized Pittsburg area sends forth the democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a different region in special elections last summer.
Lamb offers himself to other representatives, the Republican Keith Rothfus, now representative of the 12th - grade area in Pennsylvania, which is much in the new 17th - century area.
In January, after the Royal Court of Pennsylvania ruled that the old ones were organized into the benefit of the Republicans and that they were breaching the constitution, the map of the chosen area was reorganized.
The race in the new 17th Starfield has begun to compete for campaign funding between the main funding partners of both categories, the Democratic Commission (DCCC) and the National Republics Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a special election in March before the 18th century in Pennsylvania, but many watched them.
In the past, the Republicans had been holding that seat for over a decade, and President Trump, the President of the United States, won his victory in the region at 20 points.
Political experts have given a little advance to the democrats.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for support for China, but then stopped.
Kingdom stories noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already accepted Beijing, with small objections from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama in June 2017, and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the partners took off the Trump team.
The U.S. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs decided to call back the U.S. ambassador of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama for “renewal of the decision not to accept Taiwan no longer, ” said Heather Nauert, the Secretary of State in a declaration early this month.
However, penalties were considered only against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received 140 million dollars from the United States for relief work in 2017, including drug monitoring, development and financial support.
The penalties, which included, among other things, a reduction in financial support and restrictions on the publication of dormancy, would have been painful for the Central America, with a high unemployment rate and a high mortality rate.
As internal meetings continued, U.S. and Central American representatives postponed a conference on security and economic success and were to follow a similar meeting held last year, which was considered to be a step forward in measures to prevent people from moving to the United States.
In the middle of September, however, high - ranking representatives made it clear that they wanted the convention to be held, thus ending up with all the problems of punishment against El Salvador.
Mike Pence, Vice President, is now going to address the conference, to be held in the middle of October, as a symbol of how important it is in the eyes of the government, the ambassadors said.
The three American ambassadors also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr Bolton refused to discuss the discussions of the three American representatives, including two ambassadors, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion against being anonymous.
Their description was confirmed by an outsider who works closely with the government and also spoke of the matter against anonymity.
Learn History
The next scandal could be the report by Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor, on possible actions by Mr Trump to prevent justice, for which there are numerous official evidences.
It is also said that Mr Mueller is also turning his study into whether Mr Trump's campaign was working with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Congress is controlled by another group, Trump may have to be responsible for it, in the mouth that he prepares to meet his voters again, and perhaps his appointed equal.
However, this is very uncertain, and I do not want to suggest that Trump's fall is clear, nor does his colleague in Europe.
We all have to choose, both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, which will affect how long the battle will be.
In 1938 German rulers were prepared to rob Hitler of power, only if Western lands had opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years that followed.
History revolves around such important points, speeding up or slowing down the unstoppable process of democracy.
The Americans are facing a few such important sentences now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump runs the charge of Mr. Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this magazine reported that last year he had made a secret recording of the president and discussed whether he was incompetent.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times story is wrong.
“ How will we react if the recent investigation by the FBI on Brett Kavanaugh is not thorough or reasonable, or if it is confirmed in the seat of the Supreme Court, despite religious accusations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote for Congress in the middle period that will give Mr Trump responsibility?
If we fall upon these tests, democracy will have to endure long winters.
But I don't think we're going to fall because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia and was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government, who was previously in my ambassador’s residence.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with the cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I but look positive to our future?"

Graham Dorrans, Ranger's officer, vision of the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory against the Austrians will put them in a strong position to get out of the G Group of the European Union. Rangers made a magnificent draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month.
A knee injury prevented the middle guard Graham Dorrans from playing his first game in the game until the game against Wilderness, which ended with a 2-2 draw, believes that Rangers can make use of the finals as a jumpboard for better results.
“ It was good to have this level for us, because Willarreal is a strong team, ” said Dorrans, 31 years old.
“ We started the game in the belief that we could achieve something and ended up taking one step.
Perhaps we could have come forward with victory at the end, but in general, the outcome was probably reasonable.
They were probably better in the first half, and we got strong into the second half and we played better.
Thursday is another important night for the European Department.
I hope we can reach three points, but it's gonna be a hard game because they did well in their last game, but with the audiences who support us, I'm sure we'll have a positive result.
The last year was difficult, both because of my injury and the changes that occurred in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling in the place.
The team is good, and the boys are enjoying themselves. The training is good.
I hope we can move further now, put the last season behind us and achieve success."
Women lose sleep because of the fear of losing retirement savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few of them discussed it with their family members.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide survey said that they discussed the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent claimed to discuss this with their children.
“ People want family members to care for it, but it does not take the right steps to have those conversations, ” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide insurance.
Here we go.
Talk to your spouse and your children: If you do not make your wishes light with good notice, you cannot prepare your family to care for them.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and when you will receive care, since these options can change a lot about costs.
Please include your financial advisor: Your counselor can also help you find a way to pay for this cost.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care are standard life insurance with long-term care, mixed life insurance paid out in cash, to help pay costs, or self-security with your own money -- as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: Avoid legal differences in advance.
Get your healthcare provider to appoint someone you trust to supervise your healthcare provider and to ensure that healthcare professionals will respond to your wishes if you cannot say them directly yourself.
Consider, too, the cost of obtaining a fee for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your accounts are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your aged father or mother is in an emergency and is on his way to a hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please provide them with detailed information in a written schedule so that you are ready.
“ It’s not just about finance, it’s also who the doctors are,” said Martin.
“ What are the medicines?
Who's gonna guard the dog?
Have that plan ready."

Earthquakes and floods in Indonesia
At least 384 died after a powerful earthquake and a floodwave in the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, said representatives, and it is expected that the dead will increase.
Since all communication is down, relief workers have not been able to provide any information from the Donggala County, a region of northern Pala, near the center of the earthquake, which was 7.5 in Richter.
Over 16,000 people were left behind in Pala after the indisputable rage.
Here are some key facts about Pala and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the bottom of a narrow flea on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The estimated number of residents was 379.800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40 - year - old when the earthquake and the flood storm were coming.
Doggala is an county that covers more than 380 km of shoreline in the northwestern part of the island of Suawesi.
The country’s territory had estimated population numbers up to 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main industries in the Central Sulawesi region, especially in the Dongaga coastal area.
Nickel courses are also important in the province, but they are mostly in Morowali, which is on the beach in the face of Sulawesi.
In Indonesia, flood waves have swung on Pala and Doggala several times during the past century.
In 1938 more than 200 people died when floods and hundreds of Dongola houses were destroyed.
There will also be floods on the west of Doggala in 1996, where nine were killed.
Indonesia sits on the active circle of the Pacific, where earthquakes are regular.
Here are the main earthquakes and flood waves last year:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh district in northern Sumatra struck the 26th of December, triggering a flood wave that fell in 14 countries and killed 226 000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, of which more than half were in Aceh.
2005: The row of strong quakes crossed the west coast of Sumatra late in March and early in April.
Hundreds of people die on Nias Island, from the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Earthquake up to 6.8 on Richter ride over the southern part of Jöva, the largest island of Indonesia, causing a flood wave to fall on the south coast and nearly killed 700 people.
2009: Earthquake up to 7.6, Richter rides near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Suumatra.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: Earthquake up to 7.5 on Richter rides over one of the Mentawai Island, near Sumatra, and raised up to 10 feet [10 m] high waves that destroyed many villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: Due to the earthquake of Pidie Jaya County in Aceh, people remembered the destruction of the deadly earthquakes and flood waves in 2004.
There was no floodstorm this time, but over 100 died when buildings fell.
2018: Large quakes ride over the tourist island Lombok, Indonesia, and over 500 people died, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stuck on the island.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for the charge of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of Sarah Palin, former Governor of Alaska and Presidential candidate, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29 - year - old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, for trying to prevent the announcement of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report from the Alaskan State Police Department, published on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin took the phone off her friend when she tried to call the police to report an alleged crime.
Palin is held at the Mat-Su station where he awaits the hearings for judgment, and he is held against $500 insurance, according to a KTUU report.
He came to judgment on Saturday, where he declared that he was “not guilty, unconfirmed ” when asked to declare guilt or innocence, according to the news station.
Palin is accused of three crimes in Class A, which means that he could be sentenced to prison for up to one year and had to pay $25,000 a fine.
He has also been charged with a class B crime, which is punished with one day in prison and $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been accused.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is now under treatment for the Supreme Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, for preventing the announcement of domestic violence, and for carrying drugs under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend has claimed that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of donors in 2016 after she taught shock - stress disorders about the violent behavior of her son, his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and waver in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - year earthquake on Richter started a flood wave and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication systems are low and are expected to increase in the next days.
The earthquake was right in the middle of Sulawesi Island, due northeast of Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia.

Prosecutors seek a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attacker in New York City
People in New York want death sentences on Sayfullo Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for a breach of federal law since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is thought to have taken Home Depot truck on rent to hit people on a bicycle path along the street West Side Highway in the lower part of Manhattan, where he drove down walking and riding road users in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “willfully” and caused serious physical injuries “willingly, ” according to the will - decree to use the death penalty, which was recorded in the South District Court of New York.
Both of these accusers can lead to possible death sentences, according to the court record.
Several weeks after the attack, Saipov’s federal court accused 22 people, including eight charges for murder for criminal purposes, which are generally used by prosecutors in the prosecution of organized crime organisations, was also accused of violent crime and of destroying the automobile.
The attack involved “a relatively planned plan,” the accusers said, and described Sapiov’s actions as“ horrific, cruel, and immoral. ”
“ Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov became the source of physical injury, injury and loss for families and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, ” says the Willy Declaration.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It was a decade ago since the South of New York, the last death penalty was treated.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, who were eventually sentenced to life in September 2009.
In 1953, the death penalty was carried out in court in New York, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were killed after being convicted of spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, the couple were killed in the electric chair.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no evidence of repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to the legal documents.
He told an investigator that he was doing well with what he had done, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he had the idea of the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, as stated in the charge.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, said the police.
He has declared his innocence in all 22 cases of the charge.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s public guards, said that they were “unwittingly disappointed ” by the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to ask for a death penalty instead of agreeing to a declaration of guilt against life incarceration without the possibility of an experiential solution will only extend the shock due to this event for all the property owner, ” said Patton.
Saipov's guardians had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek a death penalty.
Congressman says NIGEL FARAGE should conduct negotiations on Brexit.
Nigel Farage promised to "act the army of the people" today in protests at the conservatives ’ conference.
This former Ukip leader said that politicians must “see for pressure” from skeptics across the EU, at the same time as one of Theresa May’s congressmen suggested that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
In his protesting campaign in Birmingham, jailer Peter Bone said that Britain “is going out” now if Mr. Farage was the leader of Brexit.
However, the challenge that May faces in making a deep difference between her own staff was even more evident when perpetrators who want to remain in the EU took part in other protests against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is in difficulties in keeping Chequer's plan in the right direction and is under criticism from those who are favored with Brexit, those who are opposed, and the EU.
The allies claimed that she will continue to fight to reach an agreement with Brussels in spite of opposition and forced those who are opposed to Brixit and the Workers' Party to choose between her plan and her “distress. ”
Mr. Bone said to the Leave Mean Leave protester in Solihull that he wanted to “be rid of Chequer's plan”.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been allowed to take part and shoulder responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“ If he were in the government, we would have gone out now, ” he said.
The Senator from Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit, but we must get rid of the Chequers plan.”
He explained his opposition to the EU and said: “We did not fight in world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own law in our own country."
Mr. Bone pointed out that the public opinion had changed from the 2016 elections: “The idea that the British public had changed their mind and wanted to remain is completely untrue.”
Andrea Jenkyn, a persuasive supporter of Brexit, also in the protest campaign, said to reporters: “I simply want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unfriendly among the public and opposition will not choose with it.
Please, quit Chequer's plan and start listening."
In direct messages to May, she added: “The prime ministers keep the job as they fulfill their promises. ”
Mr. Farage said that the politicians would have to be “seeking pressure” if they were to compromise the decision that was taken following the vote in 2016.
“ This is now about trust between our peoples and political parties, ” he said.
“They want to try to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell them “we won’t let you get away with this.”
He added in his messages to the crowds: “I want you to put pressure on your political party, which is about to get out of Brexit.
We challenge the forces of the public in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we have become independent, self-controlling, proud Great Britain."
At the same time, EU supporters were protesting in Birmingham, which ended with two hours of protesting in the middle of the city.
A small group of proselytes waved a flag of constituencies against Brixit after the group was set up this weekend.
Lord Adonis, of the Workers’ Party, made fun of perpetrators because of security issues raised in the group’s phone program when the conference was opened.
“ This is the people who tell us that it can have all the computer systems in place and all the technologies for Canada plus, for borders without barriers, for free trade with Ireland without borders, ” he added.
“ It’s a complete scandal.
There's nothing to call good Brixit," he said.
Warren is going to “think seriously” to make himself available to the Presidential Office.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the elections in November, he “will consider a serious offer to the Presidential Service. ”
A report from Boston Globe says that the Massachusetts democrat discussed his future at a civil meeting in the west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has unravelingly criticized Donald Trump President of the United States, is presenting himself for the re-competition in November against the Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-leader of the Trump election campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
She has been the center of a misappropriation that she could volunteer against Trump in 2020.
The meeting at Holyoke on Saturday was her 36th meeting in the form of a civil meeting with residents in her favor, since Trump took office.
At the meeting, one person asked her if she was about to offer herself to the president.
Warren replied that it would be time for women “to go to Washington and get our government together, and then a woman will also need to be a leader."
Arrested after fatal shooting of Sims from LSU
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that she had arrested one suspect in LSU's basketball player Wayde Sims, who was shot to death on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police reported an arrest at Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old at a news conference at 11 o'clock in the morning.
She had previously published a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a person who was seen on the tape.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot to death near Southern University University University University in the early part of Friday.
“Wayde Sims had a gunshot wound in his head and died because of it, ” said Murphy J. Paul, chief of police, at the media on Saturday, according to a report from 247sports.
Wayde came to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed that he had been in the field, with weapons on his way, and acknowledged that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested with no embarrassment and put in custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was two feet high and grew up in Baton Rouge, he played 32 games, of which 10 at the start of the last season played an average of 17.4 minutes, scored 5.6 points, and achieved 2.9 withdrawals in each game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after Sebastian Vettel gives him the victory seat after an order from their team.
It was evident from the fact that Captain Bottas reached his seat in front of Lewis Hamilton before the launch on Saturday, that orders from Mercedes would play a big party in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to fight against his teammate.
Vitel went first to the pit and let Hamilton drive into the traffic at the end of the group, but it should have been able to decide the finals.
The Mercedes car went into the pit one round later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton came forward after a short conflict where the driver Ferrari was forced to leave behind the inner gate after having had the risk of staying behind, after defense attempts in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started in the back of the group and was in seventh place at the end of his first ring, on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the race when he tempted to change the tires to try to finish quickly and get out of Kimi Raikkonen and reach the fourth place.
He finally went to the pit to the 44th round, but couldn't speed up the eight remaining rings, and Raikkonen took a fourth seat.
This is a difficult day, for the Vatican stood magnificent all weekend and was a true gentleman to let me go.
The team has stood wonderfully to achieve this success," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body expression.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Fenstein at a meeting on Saturday, because of her claim that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, with accusation of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed Supreme Court Judge, on sexual harassment.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but did not speak directly of the Ford testimony before the Committee of Representatives, but instead said that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were “bad and cruel and untruthful.”
“ The only thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has been going on in the past few days in the body of elders, when you see the anger, when you see people who are rich and mean and cruel and untruthful, ” he said.
“ When you see the appearances and leaks and then tell them, ” says one youth, “we, I didn’t.
I didn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you just milk this?
Remember her reply... did you just read the document - “Oh, what?
Oh, no.
So I'm not laying."
Wait a minute.
Let's say, "No, we don't lain," he said, and we imitated the senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where the charges from Ford against Kavanaugh were raised, and it was leaked early in September. Feinstein refused that the leak had come from her office.
“ I didn’t hide the charges made by Dr. Ford, I didn’t close her story,” said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill’s report.
“ She asked me to keep it confidential, and I did as she asked me to. ”
But her denial did not seem to go well into the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday: “I'll tell you, this was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't leak, but this was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued his defense for Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women, and suggested that Democrats were taking advantage of the accusations.
“ They are determined to regain power, no matter what method they need to use.
You see the ferocity, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to choose to gain power and control," said the president, according to Mediaite's report.
Elite League division: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two limits for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars added his loss on Friday in the Elite League Department against Belfast Giants by winning in the next game, 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants first received a two-point advance after a line from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were the same for locals, but Dwyer then came over Giants.
Francois Bouchard, usually for Dundee, and two lines from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen, then secured their victory.
This was the third loss in the season for Adam Keefe of the Elite League division, who had won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
This was the fourth game between the teams during the season, and Giants had won the three before.

Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will welcome Milton Keynes to their next game on Friday.
A flight director gives his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on an aircraft escape from earthquakes
After he gave his life to make sure that a hundreds of passengers could take off the boat safely, a flight director in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero.
Over 800 people have died, and many people are missing from a big earthquake on Friday, following which a wave of floods began.
Large afterquakes continue to plague the area, and many people are trapped under ruins in the city of Pala.
The 21 - year - old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave, despite the fact that his associates had fled the tower of command that was very swinging at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pala.
He remained to ensure that the Batik Air aircraft number 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake struck, could certainly be taken off.
He then jumped out of the tower when he thought he was falling down.
He later died in a hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesperson Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision has potentially saved hundreds of lives, as reported by ABC News, Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, this morning, before the helicopter reached Pala, he died.
“We’re very sad about this,” he added.
The authorities fear that the speech of the dead could exceed a thousand, as the national disaster agency says that access is limited to the towns of Dongulla, Sigi, and Boutong.
“ It is estimated that the number of deaths is still increasing, as many dead bodies are still under ruins and cannot be reached, ” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, director of the Agency.
Up to six feet [6 m] high, there will be a mass funeral on Sunday.
The army and passenger aircraft are working to provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said in an interview with Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance comes with a body.
There's little clean water.
The small markets have been robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said in an interview with CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross strives to find survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it might get worse."
Joko Widodo, president of Indonesia, came to Pala on Sunday, and said to the army of the country: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the missions related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" said a story from CNN.
Earlier this year earthquakes over Lombok, Indonesia, killed over 550 people.
Accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that there is a lack after a plane crashed into the zone
The airline, which had a plane that crashed into a zone in Micronesia, now says that one person is missing, after saying in the past that all 47 passengers and crews had been rescued from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini announced that from the afternoon on Saturday it was not known about the death of one male passenger.
The airline said that they worked with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped save the other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed into the water when she tried to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, U.S.A., U.S. agents said that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in a hospital on Saturday and that all of them were stable.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and the exact order of events.
The U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy said that both the aircraft had been hit by a lot ahead of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had gone too far over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the flight of the plane was very low.
"That was really good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others could water down the water and reach emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the pilots were afraid and crying and that he had a small head injury.
The U.S. Marines said that, before the plane sank about 30 feet [30 m] of deep water, seamen who were at work were also helping rescue by using an insurgent boat.
The Air Safety Agency's data show that 111 people have been killed in aircraft accidents involving PNG registered aircraft in the last two decades, none of which were related to Air Niugini.
An expert describes the timeline of the night that a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors closed their case on Saturday in a re-uptake against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert from the U.S. Department of Justice, was in the courtroom for hours as a specialist in information analysis.
He described the way he used cell records to blend the journeys of the accused, 29 - year - old Quinton Tellis, and the 19 - year - old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said that she had received location data from several cell phones that showed that Tellis had Chambers's evening that she died, contrary to his previous claims, as reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When evidence showed that his cell phone was with Chamber at the same time as he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said that she had not been in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said it was “a lie, for my car was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said she knew Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Mobile data showed that they had only known them for one week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chamber's death, Tellis had deleted text messages, phone calls, and her contact information from her phone.
“ He destroyed her from her life, ” said Hale.
It is estimated that the outsiders will make their final speech on Sunday.
The judge said that he would expect the matter to be brought before the abdominal court later that day.

Another black person?!
Nanny in New York lawsuited a married couple for the expulsion of a “prejudiced” text message
A Nanny in New York’s lawsuited couple because of an illegal departure after she received an accidental text message from her mother, who complained that she was “a different black person. ”
So the couple refuse to be prejudiced and liken the lawsuit to “destruction. ”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, declared dissatisfied when she learned that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work for the first time in 2016.
“NEEEIIII OTHER WRITING MANNESKY” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in text messages.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
After discovering their mistakes, Plasco-Flaxman, Ms. Maurice, said that their former father - in - law had done a bad job and that she had been expecting a Filipino woman, according to a New York Post report.
Miss Maurice was paid for one of his workdays and then sent home to Uber's car.
Maurice is now prosecuting her husband and wants to make up for theft, that the amount of 350 dollars a day for the six - month job she had originally been hired, even though no contract was signed.
“ I wanted to show them that you shouldn’t do this, ” she said in an interview with Post on Friday, adding, “I know this is a difference. ”
The couple have objected to the accusations that they were prejudiced and say that running Maurice was the right thing to do, for they felt that they could not trust her after insulting her.
“ My wife sent her messages that she didn’t mean to say.
She's not prejudiced.
We're not prejudiced people," said the husband Joel Plasco to Post.
“ But who would trust their children for someone after showing such rudeness, even though it was a surprise?
The newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco likened the lawsuit to “destruction, ” and said that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in“ a very difficult situation. ”
“ Are you going to attack someone in this situation?
It's not very nice done," said Plasco, who works in the investment company.
The matter is still on trial, but the public has spoken harshly about the social media group, and it is a shame for their conduct and reasoning.
Paddington’s publishers feared that readers would find it difficult to like a talking bear, says a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the adoption of the book, said of the letter: “It is difficult to follow someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
"It's very funny now that we know of the enormous success of Paddington."
She said that her father, who worked as a member of the BBC before he was inspired to write a children’s book about a small toy bear, had accepted the rejection of his work in a calm manner, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book was “beloved ” after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, which is described as “a very important member of the family, ” she added that her father had been silently proud of his success in the end.
“ He was a very quiet man and not used to bragging himself, ” she said.
“ But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child who does something, and you are proud of it even if you haven’t really done anything yourself.
I think he just looked at Paddington's success that way.
Though Paddington was a work of creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington the credit."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye through the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but without success.
“Nad called me regularly and told me that the situation was very bad, that she wasn’t expected to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Since then, Nad called me and said that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine given to her by her doctors to maintain her heart rate was gradually losing its activity and leaving her body.
She had died shortly before, and this was the body giving up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing it was all happening.
I could not groan or cry, for I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned her dead daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the difficulties she experienced.
“ Nobody knew anything,” she said.
“ I killed my head, and tears fell all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but during the flight, I felt much compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Debilitating women hang a message to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who had loved ones who killed themselves now try to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted messages on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers that people can call and get help.
Tyler, a son of Miss Davis, was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide when he was 18.
“ I don’t want any parent to feel like I have to suffer every day, ” she said.
Miss Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a successful cook with a contagious smile.
“ He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could light up any room."
He stopped working before he died, for “he was sunk into a very dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, 11 years old, found his brother dead after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said: “I am constantly concerned that there will be an exaggeration of it. ”
Miss Davis made the message “to let people know that you can go and talk to others, even a friend.
Don't sit and say nothing--you need to talk to someone."
Miss Humphrey, a friend of Ms. Davies for years, lost Mark his mate to 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“ He didn’t talk about his suffering or feeling depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“ Some days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He was on his worst Christmas day, when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look in their eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a great shock to them, but that they had to work out: “This tears a hole in the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we must endure and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on blue fiber when the FBI has its investigation
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for - a limited time and scope - we could perhaps reach a slight agreement,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was “crossing” in the middle of a conflict between the divisions where everything was in the back.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his republic supporters want the FBI to investigate the case?
They are slowed down because of the timing.
After just five weeks, November 6, when the Republicans do bad, as expected, this weakens their serious efforts to get their husband elected to sit in the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush has been calling U.S. Senators to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and met his wife Ashley through him, who was the secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI reports?
A vote will be held at the assembly of elders, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting right now.
It is not yet certain that Mr. Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, but it would enable Mr. Mike Pence, Vice President, to break the balance and confirm him in the office of the Supreme Court.
Number of people fleeing North Korea “decreases” under Kim
The number of those fleeing North Korea and going to South Korea has decreased from the time Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a Senator from South Korea.
Park Byeong-sug, quoted data from the South Korea Community Council, and said that 1127 people had fled last year, compared with 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that more stringent border guards between North Korea and China and higher charges were ruined by smugglers with people as key elements.
Pyongyang has not issued a public declaration.
The vast majority of those fleeing North Korea are invited to the Civil Rights of South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 people from North Korea have been crossing the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people flee to China, which has the longest border of North Korea, and it is easier to cross them than it is to maintain a neutral area between North and South Korea.
China sees the refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return to their homeland.
Communication between North and South Korea, which is still at war, has technically improved substantially over the past few months.
Earlier that month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for discussions that were mainly about deferred nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This was a historic meeting in June between President Trump of the United States and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work together in a rough manner towards a nuclear-free Korean disaster.
On Saturday, however, Mr. Ri Yong Ho, Foreign Minister of North Korea, taught American business prayers about the lack of progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about the safety of our country, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to take one-sided down our nuclear weapons first,” said Ri in his speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “the Mothersick” and says he is incompetent to perform the post of Supreme Court Judge
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the council, called Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court judge “motherly sick ” and told him that he was too moody to be able to serve in the Supreme Court.
On Saturday, at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas, Pelosi put those words in the interview.
“ I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had ever done so, she would have been called a mother’s disease, ” said Pelosi about her reaction to the testimony of Kavanaugh to the committee of elders on Thursday.
Kavanaugh rejected the accusations that he had attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when he was both teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and at times he ran up and got a cake in his neck when he discussed his family and school years.
Also, he publicly condemned the Democrats on the committee and called the accusations upon him “unfortunately organized genocide, ” organized by liberals who were angry at the loss of Presidentialism of Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not work at the Supreme Court, for he showed that he was partial to the democrats.
“I think that these statements and how he attacked the Clintons and Democrats show that he is incompetent for the job,” she said.
Pelosi did not answer when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh fired if he was confirmed and if Democrats reached the majority of the council.
“ I’ll say this: if he’s not telling the Congress or the FBI the truth, he’s not only incompetent to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he’s now,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is now a judge at the Washington D.C. appeal court.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about the possible decisions made by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or abortion law of Roe v. Wade, where he is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing, Kavanaugh turned his attention to questions as to whether he would turn aside certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“ This is no time for a mother - ill, partial person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say, “It’s wonderful. ”
And women need to take advantage of it.
This is a righteous proverb, a month and a year of rage, and so it does not come out without crying.
“ We we weep when we get angry, ” said Miss Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon, but you?"
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was the manager somewhere and said that she was crying too when she was angry, but she had developed technology so that when she was angry and started crying, she said to her householder,“ Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Because they are essentially misunderstood, anger is allowed to be expressed in part.
One of my most clear memories of my former job with men in the majority, where I began to cry out of anger that I couldn't express, came an older woman and took my head in the face of me. She was a cold boss that I had always feared a little bit and she pulled me into the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
They don't know you're upset.
They think that you are sad and rejoiced at having come in on you."
Patricia Schroeder had been working with Gary Hart when he was on a presidential commission, who was then the representative of the Democrats from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught with a glimmer on the board of a boat named Monkey Business (Apaplay) and withdrawn his offer, Ms. Schroeder felt that there was no reason why she could not consider offering herself to the president.
“ This was not a well - thought - out decision, ” she said, laughing at me, 30 years later.
“ There were already seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone named it "The Whites and the Seven Dwarves."
Since the campaign was long over, she was behind what was involved in funding, so she promised not to volunteer unless she could collect $2 million.
There was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters, who gave it only $20,000 to men, gave it only $250.
“ Do they think I’m getting a discount? ” she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not formally present herself, she was so overcome by emotion - gratitude to the people who had supported her, an resentment to the system, which made it so difficult to raise money and direct their vision to voters instead of representatives, and anger into the gender divide - that she burst into tears.
“ I might think I had a nervous breakdown, ” said Ms. Schroeder, remembering how the media responded.
“ It might be that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what's going to be written on my femur?
"She cried?"
Reasons for a trade war between the United States and China may be good for Beijing
The first rounds of the trade war between the United States and China were excruciating, and even though the war is far from over, it could be beneficial for Beijing for a long time, says experts.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, shot the first warning shot earlier this year by taxing China’s major export goods, including solar wires, steel, and aluminium.
This week, most of the score came with new customs duties that cover goods worth $200 billion ( £150 billion) and tax as well as half of all the goods that are imported into the United States from China.
Peking has responded in the same way each time, adding 5 to 10 percent of U.S. customs duties to worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to customs adjustment in the United States, and it is unlikely that another world’s largest economy will be coming to an end.
In order to get Washington to jump away from demands, but it would be far too degrading for Xi Jinping, President China, to bow down publicly from the United States.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing holds the cards correctly, pressure from the trade war with the United States could have a positive impact on China for a long time, by reducing the mutual need for both sectors.
“The fact that an accelerated political decision in either Washington or Beijing could lead to a situation leading to economic collapse in each country is, in fact, much more dangerous than the viewers have previously acknowledged, ” said Abigail Grace, an investigator who focuses primarily on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria is “made ready” for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready for refugees to return to the country and seek help to rebuild the land, which is now in bad condition after seven years of war.
Mr Walid al Moualem, Foreign Minister, spoke to the UN General Assembly, saying that circumstances in the country are improving.
“ Today, ” he said, “the state of the earth is lower and safer, thanks to its success in the fight against terrorism. ”
The government continues to bring about a normal situation by building up areas completely destroyed by terrorists.
Everything is now ready for refugees to return to the country they were forced to leave for terrorism and one - sided economic decisions aimed at their daily lives and jobs.
It is estimated that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country from the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six more million people still live in the country need help.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian authorities would like to accept assistance in rebuilding the land.
However, he stressed that they would not accept assistance on the basis of conditions or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European Union has won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by winning the U.S. team with a final result of 16.5 at 10,5 points on the Le Golf National well outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive losses on a European basis and has not won Ryder Bicycles in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when, under the leadership of the Danish leader Thomas Bjorn, it reached 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had most of the competition, struck his initial blow into the water on the 16th hole, a couple of three, and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone brightly in all his games and became 1 out of 4 players to get the result 05-0-0, since the competition started using its present format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5/4 against Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, who was at the bottom of the ranks of the players in the European team.
Dustin Johnson, at the top of the list of the best golfers in the world, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who played possible in his last competition for the Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times about the Ryder Cup, became the winner of the competition with 25,5 careers.
“ Generally I don’t cry, but today I can’t do anything else.
This has been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to get my cup back.
It's all about the past, and it was a pleasure to be able to help," said Garcia, after Europe's victory.
He gave his countryman John Rahm the legend, but he won the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 at a solo game on Sunday.
“ I was incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him, ” said the 23 - year - old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and is now registered with 13-21-3 in the race for the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange conclusion for one of the best players in history, who has won 14 big titles and is only in second place after Jack Nicklaus.
The American team found it difficult to find themselves on the field, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played a good game throughout the race.
The leader of the United States, Jim Furyk, said of disappointment with his team’s performance, “I’m proud of them, they fought.
It was at some point in the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him.
I'll take off Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 of his players play very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with PGA in the United States and name the Ryder Cup and we'll move on.
I love these 12 men and I'm proud to be their leader.
You have to take off.
They played better than we played."
