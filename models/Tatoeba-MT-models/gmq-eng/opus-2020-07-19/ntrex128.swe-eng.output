AM in Wales is worried to "make a puckon"
Some AM members of the Wales National Assembly are confused about a proposal to change their title to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Wales Parliament).
The proposal is intended to change the name of the National Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
AM across the political spectrum is worried about being ridiculed.
An AM for Labour said his group was worried because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who can't Welsh: Twp means stupid in Welsh and pwp means bajs.
An AM for Plaid said that the group in general was "dissatisfied" and has proposed other options.
A conservative warlord said that his group is "open" for the change of name, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mup.
In this context, W is spoken in Welsh like the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which currently compiles legislation for the change of name, said: "The final decision for what members of the congregation should be called is clearly up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the Wales Assembly Parliament.
While the title of AM was in force, the Commission proposed the Welsh Parliament Members (Members of the Wales Parliament) or the WMP, MWP received the highest support in a public consultation.
The AM apparently proposes other options, but problems in reaching consensus can cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the amendment within a few weeks.
Legislation for the amendments also includes other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules on disqualification of an AM and the design of the comitology system.
AM may vote on what to call them when they debate legislation.
Macedonia shall conduct a referendum on the amendment of its name.
On Sunday, the voters will vote in case they change the name of the country to the North Macedonian Republic.
The referendum is an attempt to close a dispute that has been going on for decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the neighbouring country's name represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempt to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonia's President, Gjorge Ivanov, opposes the referendum on the change of name and has said that he will disregard the result.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells in St Martin's silence when the churches in Harlem encounter problems
"Elder people I'm talking to said there was a bar and a church on every corner of the year before," said Mr. Adams.
"Now there is neither. "
He said it's understandable that the bars are gone.
"People hang out in other ways now," he said.
"Barer is not like the living room of the area anymore, where people go on a regular basis."
The churches in question are concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not go as far as the leaders expect and that "before or later they will end up on the square again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with ownership apartments filled with people who do not help the remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to the closure of all the churches, because those who move into the apartments will probably not become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist Assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of stores on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who refused to employ or promote black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when the Pastor Johnson Assembly planned the renovation they also built the clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St Martin's, proudly called the music game "the clocks of the poor".
The expert who played the clock game in July had a different name for it: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first watch game played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the major watch game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
The events of recent months at St. Martin's are a complicated history of architects and entrepreneurs – some of which have been served by church playmates, others by the Episcopal Foundation.
The Church Meeting – the governing body of the church made up of laymen – wrote to the Foundation in July and expressed concern that the Foundation would "try to transfer the cost" to the Church Meeting, even though the Church Meeting had not been involved when the Foundation hired architects and entrepreneurs.
Some congregation members complained about a lack of transparency from the foundation.
Shark hurts 13-year-olds who dive after lobsters in California
Last Saturday a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who appeared after lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack took place just before seven o'clock in the morning, near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy call for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy was only happy to have found a lobster, but then he realized that the boy screamed, "I've been bitten!"
"I've been bitten!"
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he noticed that all the key legs had been torn up.
"I cried out to everyone to get out of the water. "It's a shark in the water!" told Hammel.
The boy flew to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is stated to be critical.
It's unclear what a shark it was.
The janitor Larry Giles told the media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been established that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said the victim had trauma damage on his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but that most people are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's entering Britain's beauty market
Sainsbury's taking on Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with departmental-like beauty walks with beauty specialists.
As part of a significant push into Britain's beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the fall of the fashion and household market, the larger beauty channels will be tested in 11 stores across the country and implemented in more stores next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the supermarket's attempt to fill the shelves that used to be taken up by TV sets, microwave ovens and household products.
Sainsbury's said they would double their beauty offer to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing offers from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain greater space with marked areas, as in shops like Boots.
The shop chain also re-launches its boutique makeup brand so that most of the products are vegan – something that more and more young customers require.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will test stand in two Sainsbury's stores – the first stand opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend to buy smaller amounts of food every day in local shops means that supermarkets need to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their stores will look more and more like department stores in an effort to fight cheap shops like Aldi and Lidl with more services and products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos-stands in hundreds of stores and has also obtained a number of Habitat-stands since they bought both chains two years ago, which according to them has increased the sale of food and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The quick purchase's previous attempt to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a face lift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a cooperation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended after a dispute as to how the revenues from Boot's sales in the supermarket would be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold his pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, who owns the chain Lloyd's Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
They argue that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an extended range of luxurious skin care products, including labels such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial manager, said: "We've given our beauty walks a new look and a new feeling to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can advise customers.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all needs, and with an appealing environment in smooth places, we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "pussing" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the deal of £11 million
Dragons Den-star Peter Jones is "pussing" about the TV representative Holly Willoughby pulling out of a deal of £11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time for their brand Truly, with leisure clothing and accessories.
Their activities have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
This Morning representative, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons The Star Peter Jones furious by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand in the last minute – to focus on their new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources Jones was "raised" at a excited meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire last Tuesday when the TV favorite admitted that her new contract – worth up to £1.5 million – meant that she no longer focused on their brand True, with leisure clothing and accessories.
The operations have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and were expected to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she was leaving Truly on Instagram Jones flew to one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was clearly Holly's prime priority.
It would be her long-term future for the coming decades.
Her decision to pull out shocked everyone involved.
No one could think it happened last Tuesday, so near the launch.
There is a stock full of goods ready to be sold at Marlow headquarters."
Experts believe that this Morning representative's decision to withdraw can cost the company several million because of significant investments in everything from cushions and candles to clothes and the risk of further delays in the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The baby mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, taking the role of Chairman in March.
Couples vacation together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be a brand partner for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as hosting "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source near Jones said last night: "We don't comment on his business."
"And then we fell in love"
He joked that the media would criticise him for a comment that some would consider to be "an unworthy president" and because he was so positive about North Korea's leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a "newscreed" voice:
"I didn't give up."
He said that Kim wants a second meeting after Trump celebrated their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
The negotiations on nuclear disarmament, however, have taken place.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, North Korea’s top diploma Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the UN General Assembly last Saturday that North Korea does not see a “equivalent response” from the United States after North Korea’s first disarmament step.
He noted that instead, the United States continues sanctions intended to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his followers.
"It's going great with North Korea," he said.
"We were on our way to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his attempt to improve the relationship with Kim has had positive results – an end to rockets, freed hostages and returned remnants of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about Kim's relationship.
"It's so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this packed arena we'd have about 200 people here," Trump said and pointed to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake ruin island in Indonesia, hundreds die
After the earthquake on Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population had lost their homes, there was no call for an exemption, which is required for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they do not ask for international help, which complicated everything," said Ms. Sumbung.
Saving the children collects a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear whether foreign staff can work there.
Mr. Sutopo, the natural disaster agency spokesman, said that Indonesian officials evaluated the situation in Palu to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the aid work.
In view of Indonesia's continuing earthquakes, the country is still sadly unprepared for nature's anger.
It has been built tsunami protection in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite the fact that a warning had been issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia's many islands.
Natural disasters further complicated logistics.
A hospital ship that has been anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia's worn infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and rails.
But inadequate funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration before next year's elections.
Mr. Joko is also pressed by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christians and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, elbows and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge signed the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a target in 89 minutes in Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqi around 30 meters from Chelsea's target when his team was behind with 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick against the far chair.
The attempt flew high across the target area towards the top right corner of the grid.
The ball finally fell over Kepa Arrizabalaga's hope and ended up on the net.
"I was just trying to get in a position to get to the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, and I didn't think much of it, but I just kicked it."
Chelsea led by 1-0 after the first half of a goal in 25 minutes from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue string turned a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, spind off near the middle field and sprinted to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic did a quick give-and-go at the middle field.
Then he had a great kick that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard ran away from the defense and got the ball in the net at the farthest pole with a left footed kick past Liverpool Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights Napoli in the group stage of Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 a.m. on Wednesday.
Chelsea is facing Videoton in the Uefa Europa League in London at 15:00 on Thursday.
The death rate for tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death rate for the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people were reported to have been stuck in the ruins of buildings that have broken into the earthquake of 7.5 that struck on Friday and triggered waves of up to six meters, said the office spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The town of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of rapids from buildings that were broken.
The police are arrested, 32 suspects of murder after women are killed.
A murder investigation has been started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 with knife wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested suspected of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who saw or heard something to come forward.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "We're at an early stage of the investigation, but I'm asking everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information that is essential for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived to the place to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police inform the victim's immediate relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment, but the police said no one can get into or get out of the building.
He became speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents in the building have been informed that it takes several hours to get back in.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman showed up at the scene.
She says "it's so awful" over and over again.
At 14:00, there were two police cars inside the lockout and another just outside.
A number of police assistants were inside the detoxification with an overview of the apartment building.
Persons with information are asked to send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell's latest victim of a dispute over the rewriting of history
A ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion "deaf" and "try writing about history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be dragged into the ongoing debate about removing statues."
The iconoclasm during the civil war in England was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the 19th century's views on and is part of the history of a man who many consider should still be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more in the late 1800s than now, believes that Cromwell defended Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case from monarchy.
If this is a proper representation, it is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has undoubtedly affected the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person who represents one side of the matter.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated.
Kidney kills a farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, who was only identified with his last name Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood in a path on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post in Sunday.
A pig breeder is ready to inject the vaccine into pigs in a pig sample on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He is reported to have traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The cousin then found him dead and discovered that the door to a pig's path nearby was open.
He said there was a big pig male in a pig's stew with blood on his mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kilo of heavy pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and distorted," said the cousin who was identified with the surname Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 p.m.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to avoid more attacks while the police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market leaders are reported to negotiate compensation for his death.
It's rare that pigs attack people, but it's happened before.
2016 attacked a pig a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and caused serious damage to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 kilos pig pressed a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "catalyst".
"They're just playful.
They nauseous and are very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
The rest of Hurricane Rosa for extensive heavy rain to southwest United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it travels over cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flooding rain to northern Mexico and southwest America in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind force of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at five EST on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a tree begins to form across the Pacific Ocean and travel east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture north into the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that interacts with the nearing trawl will create vastly heavy rain in the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Locally 2.5-10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, clay streams and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5–7.5 cm of rain per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5-10 cm of rain is expected in some places in the southwest of the United States, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly impaired conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
When tropical rain is expected, it is absolutely not recommended that someone leave the desert on foot.
Heavy rain can make canyons into flowing rivers and thunderstorms lead to strong local winds blowing around sand.
The approaching trawl brings some locally strong rain to parts of southern California's coastline.
It is possible with a total of over a cm of rain, which can lead to clay streams and tail roads.
That would be the first rain in the area during the rainy season.
Some scorched tropical rains will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more extensive later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October can cause intense temperature changes throughout the United States, when the Arctic cools down but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes at short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States on Sunday.
There is almost ten degrees difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the coming days the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to get a warm start on October with around 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about five degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high chance of warmer temperatures than the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million looked at Brett Kavanaugh's questioning
More than 20 million Witnesses from Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault that should have taken place in the 1980s on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political situation continued and the normal broadcast was interrupted for Friday's last minute twist – Arizona's Senator Jeff Flake's agreement with the FBI where they got a week to investigate the accusation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she's absolutely sure that Kavanaugh took care of her when he was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said he's absolutely sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers on Friday was higher than the 20.4 million reported by Nielsen.
They counted the average number of viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other TV networks that showed the interview, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has problems counting people watching from offices.
In comparison, there are as many viewers as for a football match in the playoffs or Oscarsgalan.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown strong support for Kavanaugh’s nomination, had most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long interview, according to Nielsen.
ABC had the second most with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest continued to be high after the hearing.
Flake was the focus of Friday's drama.
After the Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh filmed CNN and CBS demonstrators who screamed at him when he tried to take an elevator to a hearing with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the demonstrators screamed at him, which was shown in live transmission by CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors were closed he said he would have more to say after the questioning with the committee.
The TV networks sent live several hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted if they were to pass on Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the whole Senate.
But Flake said he was going to do it only if the FBI was going to investigate the charges against the nominated person in the next week, which the minority democrats have claimed.
Flake was partly convinced by his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political games" around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" about the future of Britain and to undermine the interest of the nation in an interview with Sunday Times.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that the proposal that the UK and the EU collect each other's customs duties was "completely unreasonable".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: The police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect for the death shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and put in custody for murder, said the police in Baton Rouge.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
The police found the glasses on the spot and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After questioning with Simpson, the police said he confessed to shooting Wayde's death.
His bail was fixed at $350,000, according to Advocate.
The court doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the head and into the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police's refugee force, the state law lab of the police, the Southern University police and residents in the area for helping with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU’s Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their “fight and pursuit of justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98 meter long front grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Last Friday's morning, LSU's basketball coach, Will Wade, said the team was "cryssed" and "chocked" by Wayde's death.
"You're worried about this all the time," said Wade.
Vulcan asks ashes over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatépetl has reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
National Center for Disaster Prevention warned in Saturday Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity had been discovered in the crater and the registered 183 gas and ash emissions over the course of 24 hours.
The center discovered several mullets and scalps.
Social media images showed thin layers of ash on windscreens in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have noted increased activity in the volcano that stands 72 km southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 affected central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police strike together with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after the demonstrators of independence met with the call for police, while thousands of people participated in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalan polarizing vote on delay.
A group of masked separatists held back by the collar police threw eggs and color powder on them, leading to dark dust on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Fightings also broke out later during the day and policemen used their batons to stop them.
For several hours, the independence groups cried out, "Never forget, never forgive" while the Unionists cried out, "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor damage caused by protests, according to local pressure.
The struggle is still tense in the region, which longs for independence one year after the referendum on the first October which was considered illegal by Madrid but was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
A overwhelming majority voted in favour of independence, but participation was low when most of the people who were against the session boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when the police tried to stop the vote at polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped during the night of Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but was forced to take another route.
The electrician Narcis Termes, 68, participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said that he no longer believes that Catalonia will be independent.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry out with joy about being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal profit in regional elections in December, Catalan parties who are for independence have had difficulty keeping the momentum up this year, as many of their most well-known leaders live in self-inflicted exiles or are in custody pending trial of their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his mobile phone, said that the conflict had been fired on by politicians on both sides.
"It gets more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year, announced that he will be running out in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Failure to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the subjugation we have experienced from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving into the house
Three men — 33, 34 and 39 — have been arrested after a car was taken into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Detective Bob Blemmings said that the gates and the building itself were damaged.
An armbrush may also have been fired against the car.
Menga gives Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the prize
Livingston shocked Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss of 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mengas's strike turned out to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was shared with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side has still not got a win away in the Premiership this season and meets Hears, with eight points more, next Sunday.
Before it welcomes Rangers Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
Livingston extends his profit to six games – the main coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since replacing Kenny Miles last month.
Livingston misses chances against cross visitors
Holt's law should have taken the lead long before they scored; their uprightness gave Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his performance across the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot wide after glidit in to measure Craig Hallkett's Necking across the goal.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could attack in certain games.
And that's how the crucial goal was made.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to give Menga a chance, which made goals from the middle of the target area.
In that situation, Rangers had dominated the ball, but the defense of the home team was impenetrable and the goalie Liam Kelly was largely left in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Ranger's goaltender Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot a board from another of Livingston's determined games.
Crossings constantly entered the destination area of Livingston and were handled without problems. Two penalty demands – following the challenge of Hallkett by the replacement Glenn Middleton and one by hand – were dismissed.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal display and results for Livingston.
Each one of them was outstanding and continues to exceed the expectations of the road upwards.
Their playing style and staff have hardly changed since they returned to the upper level, but Holt deserves the honor of having galvanized the team since their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a skilled organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his head straight through.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
They have had their moments during Gerrard, but they did not live up to the standard.
Their last ball did not hold the mat – they only opened the home page once – and it is one of the alarm clocks for Rangers, which is in the middle.
Erdogan receives a mixed welcome in Cologne
Saturday offered smiles and blue sky (29 September) when Turkey’s and Germany’s leaders at breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – to repair the relationship between the NATO allies.
They have become ossified at human rights, freedom of the press and the entry of Turkey into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world's largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed that they prevented 25 000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many followers gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti- Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurdish – also made their voices heard and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German Government's decision to welcome him to Germany.
The duelling protests show the divided views of a visitor who is considered a hero by certain German Turks and is condemned as an unviolable ruler by others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in a crash by car
A cyclist died in a crash with a car in London.
The crash took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-tapped road in Deptford in southeastern London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and the nurse was called there, but the man died on the spot.
The crash takes place a few months after another cyclist died in an infection accident on Childrens Street, about 1.5 km from the crash last Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said they're trying to identify the man and inform his immediate relatives.
Roads have been blocked off and buses have been redirected and drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in tummy
Six prison guards have been injured in unrest at a high security prison for men, according to Prison Office.
The unrest broke out on HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and is still going on.
Specialized Tower Guards have been called there to deal with the unrest, involving eight prisoners on a wing.
The guards were treated in place for minor damage to the face.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: " Specially trained prison staff have been sent there to handle the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those who are behind it will be assigned to the police and may have increased prison sentences."
HMP Long Lartin accommodates over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the prison director was treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the collar police were called to prison to deal with serious unrests in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
The Orkan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (areas with drought can benefit)
It is rare that tropical low pressure reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa’s remaining energy pulls over the desert in the southwestern United States, with the risk of sudden flooding.
National Weather Service has already issued alerts for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and bring rain late on Monday.
National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of Arizona border".
National Hurricane Center's latest models predict 5-10 cm of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwestern United States, including central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to get 2.5–5 cm of rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without risk of sudden floods, Rosa's rain may be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Weaknesses are very serious, but some of the rain is likely to be useful because the southwest of the United States suffers from drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reported weather.com.
The Orkan Rosa will first travel across the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa, still with Hurricane Power in Sunday morning with a maximum wind force of 135 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north for 20 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, which calms it down.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico’s land mass as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico can have heavy rain, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 7.5–15 cm of rain is expected from Baja California to Northwest Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm", reported weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm and reach Arizona's border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert in southwestern USA," said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life - threatening sudden floods and clay streams in the desert, as well as rocky terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three boys in teens and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST last Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the situation is reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in Radstock, said the police in Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking anyone who might have file feeded what happened to the phone to come forward.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "led, meanness, anger" from the democratic party
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the democratic party's carelessness and scandalous tactics," said Trump to his followers in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered from "illuminity, anger" from the democratic party throughout the process of nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before the Congress of Thursday and strongly denied and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he was sexually assaulting her for decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified to the Congress about his accusation.
The president said last Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliant and the quality and the fashion" at Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most skilled legal minds of our times, a lawyer with a first class history of serving the public," he said to his followers in the audience in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of republicans voting in the upcoming midterm equations.
"We are five weeks from one of our lives' most important choices.
I don't know, but I can't. He said I can't.
"That's why I go around fighting for sovereign candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are trying to "fail and hinder".
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to a senior republican leader.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number of rises
At least 384 people died, many were swept away when giant waves crashed against the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities of Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival at the beach in the town of Palu on Friday when up to six meters high waves crashed against the beach at dusk and swept out many to a safe death and destroyed everything in its path.
Tsunamine came after an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami warning came yesterday, people stopped on the beach instead of immediately running away, and they fell victim to tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of Indonesia's disaster agency GDPB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"Tsunamine was not alone but dragged cars, logs and houses. It hit everything in its path," said Nugroho. He also said that tsunamine had been traveling on the high seas for up to 800 km/h before the affected coastline.
Some climbed up trees to escape tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
The aerial photographs released by the Emergency Bureau show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and have collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
Afterscalves still hit the coastal city last Saturday.
The line of earthquakes felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia’s agency for the evaluation and application of technology BPPT stated in a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake last Friday was 200 times as large as the nuclear bomb released on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city is at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made tsunamine bigger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the devastation as "wide" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found on the brink of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and injuries could be even worse along the coast line 300 km north of Palu, an area called Dongaga, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication from Donggala "was completely paralysed without any information," said Nugroho.
"There are more than 300 000 people there," said the Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
The firm was criticized on Saturday for not having informed that tsunami had fought against Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had appeared within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man upstairs is heard in a building screaming frenetic warnings about tsunami to people on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water crashes against the beach and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to an extensive power outage that interrupted all communications around Palu, which made the rescue work difficult for the authorities.
The military has begun to send cargo flights with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated persons are still in great need of food and other supplies.
The city airport has been opened for the relief work and remains closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of persons killed in tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Members of the World Vision in Donggala have taken to Palu, where they seek protection during tarpaulins at the farm outside the office, but they saw destruction along the way, according to Mr. Dosaba.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Aid groups have started the most important aid work, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and staff from abroad may only be used if an exemption permit is issued after a disaster.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the authorities say it's a national disaster, we can let international aid in, but that status has not been announced yet."
When the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of missing persons still hoped that their loved ones would prove to be the miracles that light up bleak natural disasters.
Last Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, the rescue workers saved a woman who has been stuck under a hurry for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesia's national flight team trainer, had trained two of the missing flights before the Asian games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others stuck at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mondayi, were his students.
"As a screen flying vet, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told me that the hours after the screen flying heard that Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who attended the beach festival.
But his messages only got one gray bock, instead of two blues.
"I think it means the messages weren't delivered," he said.
Twenty takes $26,750 during ATM refilling at Newport on the Living
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26 750 from a Brink's employee who filled a ATM at Newport on the Living, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had emptied a ATM in the entertainment facility and had to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the message.
While he was busy "Put another man up behind Brink's staff" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
The Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the site, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the perpetrators should contact the police in Newport on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The Rapper Kanye West changes the name – to Ye.
He announced the change of name on Twitter last Saturday and said, "The creature who is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41,has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title of its eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the program, who set up for "emotional reasons" according to the programme's creators.
Ye is a shortening of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious significance to him.
"I think 'ye' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he talked about the title of his album with the radio values Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, we are.
It went from Kanye, which means 'the only', to just Ye – a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, all.
The album is like a mirror of those we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who's changed names.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with West, has previously written his name with and without dashes and capitals.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the military against civilians now that the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody retribution against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza last Saturday to "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Ripper fired weapons against a peaceful demonstration in the square of October 2, 1968, and killed up to 600 people during an era when left-wing student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans with monthly contributions to students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and inadequate educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double AI funding
Now that China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in the field, according to the inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment comes after several parts of the US government have made statements about AI, despite the fact that the US does not have a comprehensive formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of becoming a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
A double budget can double the chance that the next big AI breakthrough will be made in the United States, Lee told the CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published earlier this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most outstanding AI companies – Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest rated American Othello player, and later he was in charge of Microsoft Research and was CEO of Google's China department.
Lee mentioned previous technology competitions from the US government, such as Robot Challenge from Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what the next would be to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government, said Lee.
"It is not China who takes the academic leaders from us, but companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired leading personalities from universities to work at AI.
Lee said that new immigration policies can also help the United States with the AI innovation.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctoral students in AI," he said.
State Council in China issued its development plan for next generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation provides grants to persons at academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organisations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
US legislation that would create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has made no progress in several months.
Macedonia's referendum on change of name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum to change the name of the country to the North Macedonian Republic, which would resolve a number of decades of old dispute with Greece which has prevented the country from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that its neighbour’s name in the north represents a requirement on its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change of name would undermine the identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Ivanov has said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has led to doubts as to whether the 50% minimum participation required for the referendum to be considered valid will be achieved.
The question at the roll-off in the referendum is as follows: "Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
However, the name-exchange supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth changing names if that means that Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia was split, can join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means safer lives for all of us," said Oliver Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but sufficient Members of this House have said that they intend to follow the outcome for it to be considered decisive.
The exchange of names requires a majority of two-thirds of Parliament.
According to the State Electoral Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 13 p.m.
But participation was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the latest parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in the Macedonia referendum on the country's change of name, which would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Outside Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a small stage and place chairs in front of the tents set up by those who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and Europe, but we want to go with our heads in the air, not sneak through the back door," said Kavardarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership of NATO would lead to well-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe that the absolute majority will vote yes, because over 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev when he voted.
He said that a "Yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a study published on Monday by the Macedonian Policy Investigation Institute, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters were voting in the referendum, which is below the minimum participation required.
Another study by Telma TV, Macedonia, said 57 percent of the participants were voting on Sunday.
70% of them were going to vote yes.
For the referendum to be counted, 50 per cent of registered voters plus one vote must be taken.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious setback for the Western-oriented government policy since it took over in May last year.
Look at: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero gets through Brighton's defense to make goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling struck Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's profit of 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored in 65 minutes.
The Argentine striker got a pass from the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and stepped out in the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around a defender and ran from several others at the edge of Brighton's target area.
Then he pushed a pass to Sterling to the left.
The English forward used its first kick in the target area to give back the ball to Aguero, who used the right foot to beat Brighton's goalie Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero has a problem with his feet," said City's manager Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
"We talked about him playing for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial take-over in the Premier League game.
The target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's revir on that game.
He sent off a nice kick along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the farthest post.
Sky Blues forwards kicked the ball into the net moment before it ended up out of reach.
City meets Hoffenheim in the group game of Champions League at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies
Nationals have been removed from the playoffs, so there was no reason to force one to start.
But competition-oriented Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies, which is a game before Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still has a chance at the end game.
Rockies got a wild card place with a win of 5-2 over the Nationals last Friday night, but is still looking for their first division title.
"We play about nothing, but we can get a chance to rub the rubber in knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the other team would play at a higher level than any other team I would face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be there?"
Nationals have not announced their start on Sunday yet, but according to reports they are inclined to let Scherzer throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, heated up in the bullpen last Thursday and would throw on his normal rest day.
Washington's right-hand chest is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 barouts in 200 2/3 interiors this season.
Trump holds speech in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of republicans voting in the coming midterm elections.
"All that we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of our lives' most important choices.
This is one of the big, big... I can't, but I can't. That's why I go around fighting for sovereign candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see a terrible, terrible group of radical democrats, you see it happening here and now.
They are determined to take back power whatever it takes, you see their badness, their terribleness.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take over power and control, that's what they want, power and control.
Democrats, he said, fights to "fail and hinder".
"You've seen that in the past four days," he said and called the Democrats "Arga and evil and terrible and false".
He mentioned the democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Judicious Committee, which was met by a high bowing of the spectators.
"Do you remember what she said?
'Did you read the document?'
'Eh, eh, huh?
No, no, no, I'm waiting for a...' It was really bad body language, one of the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They do not tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a series of MPs from Labour who hear that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament Joan Ryan was treated in a similar way when she stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on the security of the nation, on Europe – ironically similar topics for which Jeremy criticised former leaders.
The notice of the meeting with Nottingham East Labour last Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be welcoming and productive".
For most of my eight years as Labour's local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been exactly that.
But unfortunately many meetings are not, and the promise of "friendly, gentler" politics has been forgotten a long time ago, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly apparent that divergent views are not tolerated within Labour, and any opinion is judged on the basis of whether the leader of the party accepts it.
This began just after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues who I once thought had a similar political view that I expected to make a whole reversal and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed on – whether it was national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I speak publicly – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – follows a tened of the ovet on social media that requires me to be set aside, criticise my policy and say that I should not even be in Labour.
And this isn't just going to hit me.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues when they face a stream of sexist and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the greatest disappointments with this policy of yours is the level of insults that are now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour will promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, however, we are no longer this broad church and with every distrust and change in the rules of selection, the party becomes increasingly narrow.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years about flying under the radar and not being too straightforward, so "it's getting right".
But that's not why I became a politician.
Ever since I joined Labour as a school student 32 years ago, provoked by thatcher's government neglect, which literally caused my elementary school classroom to collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – both at local level and as Minister of Government.
I've never hidden my political views, and that includes the latest choice.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused by my views on policies and topics where I do not agree with current leadership.
To those of you who promoted the request on Friday, I would just like to say that as the country approaches a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services, I do not understand why anyone would like to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour party leaders.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency – both Labour Members and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threat of depriving me or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Unslagna Ayr on top
Two trials in the last minute may have distorted the result a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this lovely entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They are now at the top, the only unfurnished side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, which gave home team profits, and the coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested during our games so far and are still unbeatable, so we are of course happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's trial in 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card for Scotland's Captain Rory Hughes, released by Warriors for the match, let Melrose let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a penalty, and at the end of the first half play he scored and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead of 17-5 in the pause.
But Melrose got a good start on the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempts, which were converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
It was then a long wait for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was worn by the plan, and after the restart, Ayr increased the management again with a try from Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
Ayrs acting captain Blair MacPherson then got a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of heavy pressure.
But the home team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the penalty-line out of behind Ayr's maul.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent off the flanker Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth attempt.
Set Game star seems ready for new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiern seems ready to enter the restaurant business after it is discovered that he has been designated as CEO of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays together with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
Duon has announced that the coming ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's CEO of Afakmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow's "florious restaurant industry".
"Havet belongs to us": Coastless Bolivia hopes that the Court of Justice will open the way to the Pacific Ocean again
Seafarers patrol a rigged headquarters for the fleet in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue flag.
The fleet's bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazona's bear motto: "Havet belongs to us.
It is our duty to recover it."
In coastal Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that was lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 1800s is still strong – and it is also longing to sail again on the Pacific Ocean.
This hope is higher than for decades now when Bolivia awaits a decision of the international court on the first of October, after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia has operations, a atmosphere of unity and peace, and clearly awaits the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the international court's decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the Court of Hague will judge in favour of Bolivia's demand that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, have to negotiate with Bolivia to allow them to enter the sea.
Monday's decision also has great importance for Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president, who faces a controversial struggle for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is incredible that the Court of Justice should judge for Bolivia's benefit, and that not much would change even if it does.
The Court of Justice of the United Nations, based in the Netherlands, does not have the right to assign Chilean territory and has pointed out that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision is announced only six months after the final arguments suggests that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the past four years, it may have hurt rather than promoted Bolivia's chances.
"The question of access to the sea has been raised by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
She claims that Morale's aggressive rhetoric has worn out Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Prior to this, President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, did not consider that the Court's decision had been taken unusually quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia "an outstanding opportunity to start a new era for the relationship with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the issue of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he said.
"The decision is a chance to realize that we must move forward from the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament requires trust in the United States
North Korea's Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong Ho says that the nation will not disarm its nuclear weapons until they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly last Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the two rival leaders.
His comments came when the US Minister for Foreign Affairs Mike Pompeo seems to be on the border to solve the death situation of the nuclear weapon violence more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a "want dream" to continue sanctions and the US protests against a statement to end the Korean war will ever tame North Korea.
Washington hesitates to agree to the statement without Pyongyang first initiating significant nuclear disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread scepticism against Pyongyang really going to get rid of a weaponry that the country probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump Summit.
Paris fashion views reveal the latest line of huge headbands on the way to shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we'll have the right thing for you.
The Valentino and Thom Browne designers have revealed a range of sloppy, oversized headbands for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which dazzled the stylists at the Paris fashion week.
Incredibly unpractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designers have sent off their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino's main creation was an exaggerated beige hat with a feather-like wide hat board that took over the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a magician hat and even an pineapple – but they are not intended to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre worms, in just time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful worms had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a wet suit with snorkel and dive mask, and another looked like a melted glass hat.
And if you continue the enormous courage, you'll be lucky.
Mode experts predict that the huge verticals can be on their way to stores near you.
The oversized hats come shortly after La Bomba – the straw hat with a cut of 60 cm that has been seen on all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the incredibly unpractical hat that has taken over social media sent out yet another great creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the model in the bathing suit that held it.
The Raffia bag in terracotta, featuring electrofiafrans and a white leather handle, was excellent in Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris fashion week.
Kändistylisten Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores next summer – the designer has had such a huge impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills crucial to global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain outstanding academic results and this continued in 2018 with yet another set of outstanding test results, which are only reinforced by individual and collective progress in sport, art, music and other societal engagements.
With up to 30 000 students in Scotland, schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As an education sector capable of designing and implementing adapted curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and inquired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's test results show that languages are at the top of the list, with a maximum number of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received A in the final higher grade.
Data collected from SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 per cent of students who studied mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French, and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills such as children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as a subject selection is now considered as important as natural knowledge, technology, engineering knowledge and mathematics on curriculum in independent schools and beyond.
A study carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 concluded that employers were unable to fill their vacancies for various reasons, by 17 per cent, which was attributed to a lack of skills in languages.
With this said, language skills become all more necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With an increasing number of future jobs requiring language skills, these skills become necessary in a globalised world.
Whatever their career choice, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries, a multilingual person automatically gives a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of over 4,000 adult British published by YouGov 2013, 75 percent said they could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that came up in a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
Therefore, it is so important to invest in language education for our children.
To be able to speak multiple languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance of finding meaningful employment in the future.
In Scotland, each school learns different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach in languages considered most important for the United Kingdom for 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a teaching environment that will prepare children and have them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In a global economic environment, it is undoubtedly language that continues to be crucial for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered as "international communication capacity".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut been le faire.
John Edward is head of Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron does Lakersdebut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to watching LeBron James make debut for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers Coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play on Sunday's first season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he plays has not yet been determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Laker's official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' pre-season schedule.
"I don't need preseason games in this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia Promotion Event, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is making his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five planned performances next week, including events in places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Pending a confirmatory vote by his candidate at the post of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming interim elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress before the current elections in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trumps Wheeling, West Virginia campaign events are scheduled for 19:00, tonight Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trumps West Virginia-rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to deal with this week's questioning of the candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, who was excited after accusations of his sexual abuse, with an expected delay in the vote from the Senate of up to a week while the FBI's investigation of the case is ongoing.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help the Republicans get some meat on their legs before the November elections.
Thus President Trump said that these five conventions next week are aimed at "engaging volunteers and supporters as Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority in Senate and Representative House", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the hectic campaign period," said a spokesperson for the Trump campaign who did not want to be named Reuters.
Night events scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can pull fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh's media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisy, who has been following in the public opinion polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisy that the president must come there to try to give him an increase in his opinion polls," says Simon Hader, a state scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is struggling to keep hopes alive before Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the couple competitions in Saturday afternoon could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The mood’s swinging pendulum is a fully invented sports concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before competitions like these.
So what momentum is this now?
"They had a six point lead and now there are four, so we carry it as a small moment I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he finished the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points advance with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have a little wind in the sail, but they have a lot to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and came home three points out of four each.
Spieth has been vase from tea to green and is set by a good example.
The wine strap scaled even higher when his round continued and he lowered a decisive pit to take the game four all-square when he and Thomas had been looking for two after two games.
His boy who won them the game of 15 met with a similar wreath, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
That's all that all these players have left now.
18 holes for victory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's unquestionable story.
Europe's odd but charming couple are four from four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bowy on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bowys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These achievements and audience reactions determine that they are the players to beat on Sunday and there are no more popular players who could come home a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Mostly both, at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, along with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two doubles on front nine lowered the Spaniard and the Swedish in a hole that they never even came near to crawl out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are so fascinating to look closely at because of the interplay between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and how a strategy can be changed in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead before the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team United States has a struggle that some, especially on the side of the United States, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage on Ryder Cup's last day after coming out from Saturday's four-ball and foursomes matched with a 10-6 lead across the United States.
The inspired duon Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over a besieged Tiger Woods and came home four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European law, which fought to keep the bag that they lost at Hazeltine two years ago dominated an American law that never really started in the morning's fireball with 3--1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursome and won two games, but it didn't go for victory.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single games to keep the bag.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, baptized to "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are just the second couple to win four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup's history.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they beat an exhausted Woods and American rooke Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphasizing 5 & 4.
Woods, who settled through two games on Saturday, showed a few moments of brilliantness, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball and foursome, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested in the morning four-ball and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 & 1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe did not co-wind all the way, but it was a nice, windy day just south-west of Paris.
Threefold winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They captured the victory with 2 & 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball and later returned to beat the Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history has one team come back from a four-point underscore in single matches, however, Furyk's side only needs an undecided result to keep the bag.
After being second best for two days it looks like a counterattack on Sunday could be difficult to get through.
North Korea says that the "never" will disarm unilaterally without confidence
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations last Saturday that continued sanctions deepened their mistrust towards the United States and it was not possible that the country would surrender its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's annual General Assembly that in recent years North Korea had taken "meaning measures to show its goodwill", for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the installations for nuclear tests and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to an approach divided into stages for the nuclear power that would lead to North Korea being rewarded when it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant, because it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution entirely as Pyongyang has previously done.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a seated American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work towards "the decommissioning of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the Korean war in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first remove its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused negotiations to alleviate severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "destruction first" and increases the pressure by means of sanctions to achieve its objective by coercion and even object to the "declaration to end the war", says Ri.
"The idea that sanctions can get us on our knees is a wishful dream for those people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second Kim/Trump Summit, which was highlighted by the US leaders in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added: "If the party to this issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a deadlock."
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's future ability to reach the USA's mainland with rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocketman" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "all destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take measures to disarm, but it said that much work still remains and that sanctions have to remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months", doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The maintenance of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with force and without failure until we realize a complete, final, verified disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stifle funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programme.
Pompeo met Ri at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made. However, North Korea accused him a few hours later of setting "gossler-like requirements".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile plant and also a nuclear reactor complex if the United States took "the corresponding measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "equivalent measures" he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and moves towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take the course of getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has made all doctoral students improve their sleep habits in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-filled "dives".
One academic study found that students at the world’s leading universities are often waterless when it comes to the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first in his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deficiency on learning.
"At the end of that, a girl came up to me and said, "Why don't I know this until now, in my last year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was organised for the first time this year, explains to the students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improves their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University’s Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after having discovered that the students suffered from severe sleep deficiency during the week.
The hourly course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In part of the course there is a picture of a student room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleep failure and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deficiency can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know - just as one has the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "deep" still exists, he says and added that modern technology and ever increasing pressure on the students meant that sleep deficiency was a growing problem.
To ensure that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain because sleeplessness puts the brain in starvation and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course and has read one of his courses last year at Harvard in his first year.
He said the course was an eye opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before starting their studies at the high-performance institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students consider setting an alarm for when to lie down and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" issued by electronic screens and LED lighting, which may cause you to turn around 24 hours a day, leading to inhalation problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengas targets lower Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Mengas struck Steven Gerrard's uneven side to a 1-0 night team in Livingston.
The Ibrox page was looking to bring its first victory on the road since February 4-1-triumf on St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his team eight points after Ladbrokes Premiership leader Harts.
Menga struck seven minutes before half-time and Rangers never managed to smooth out the result.
While Rangers now fall down to the sixth place, Livingston climbs to the third and lies only behind the Hibernian on target.
And there may be more problems on the lute for Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a main year after an object has been thrown from the far end.
Gerrard made eight changes to the semifinal in Betfred Cup.
Holt on the other hand, with the same Livi 11 who took a point of Hearts last week and he would have been happy about the way his well-dead games overcome the opponents every time.
Rangers must have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball controls they had.
It should have been goaled already two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass released through Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle fielder missed his great chance and shot outside.
A free kick in the depths of Keaghan Jacobs then reached the captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the rear bar.
Rangers took control of the game, but it seemed to be more hope than faith in their games during the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelo probably felt that he should have been punished when he and Steven Lawless collapsed, but Judge Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian call.
Rangers only managed to make two first half goals, but the former Ibrox goal guard Liam Kelly easily received the Lassana Coolias nick and a tam kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Livis opening shots for 34 minutes may have gone against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their kneeling deserved it.
Again Rangers failed to handle Jacob's fixed situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fit Scott Robinson, who kept calm and chose Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the switch gave almost immediate effect when the outside struck the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block the attempt.
But Livingston continued to get the opponents to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Hallkett that swept up long passage after long passage.
Holt's side could have strengthened its leadership in the final stage, but McGregor did well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow nodded outside the corner.
Rangers replacing Glenn Middleton had another late demand for punishment when he was tamed with Jacobs, but once again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: The Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now one page from Sunday's calendar: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today...the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the manikin called Geigermeter.
Geigermeters have become a foundation for science since then and also form large in pop culture, as well as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with the leading role of the seemingly unlikely cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
MAN "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geigermeter used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms produced by the radioactivity in the minerals."Evans:
Evans: "Yes, it's popping now!"
"Hans" Geiger died 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancer forms and then re-injected
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer, saw her ovarian cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancer forms called HER2 and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of multiple types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung and large intestine cancer, Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "learning" them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA cap, after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was built out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a sloping appearance where he praised the President of the United States Donald Trump and said he would run for the post in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, where he wore a Make America Great hat, he railed against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to a white person they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon where the Hollywood Star made fools of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee on the accusations of sexual abuse made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not sent, the replay of West's exhibition was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock was trying to drive with West with the post.
West had also besieged himself before the audience that he had been harassed backstage for his main residence.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They bullied me!
And then they say I fell low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Would you also like to sink low?" and said he would "put my supermancape on, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Test with love."
His comments attracted more burop at least twice from the audience and employees from SNL seemed generated, reported Variaty. One person said: "It became deathly in the studio."
West had come in as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with its appearance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: AGAINST YOU STOP AT YOU TO THE MOBBEN."
But the protshow's host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West simply "was itself and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") whom I believe embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
So are we, she added.
Before the show the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the creature previously known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapparkolleg, Snoop Dogg has been called Snoop Lion and of course the deceased music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Judgment for attempted murder for knife cutting at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been accused of attempted murder after a man stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackmore, said the police.
The defendant is expected to arrive at the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington beats against toxic masculineity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-changing role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has said negatively about the stereotype of the macho hero and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be tough to be respected.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thinks "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity under the #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his fellow player in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he knows "gian strong" to deal with the problem.
"I personally feel pretty strong, right now--where have we gone wrong with masculineity?" he said.
"How have we raised men in the light of the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that TV can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculineity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued "What's native and what's learned?
What is taught on television and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they must be in a certain way to be a man?
I think it really is one of the big questions in our time - how do we change that?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not make any Game of Thrones follow-up when the series comes to an end next summer and says that he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
From November Kit will play in a new recording of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thought the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife thanks to the series, so that way it gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, which Kit's character Jon Snow is in love with, in the Emmys-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family owners in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820 000 people have been affected in the country, says health authorities.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases were transmitted via sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spread through certain parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected by HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000 from year to year.
HIV infection through intercourse is an emergency in China's HBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in 1997 in China, but discrimination against HBT individuals is said to be widespread.
Because of its conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men sooner or later will marry women.
Many of the cases of infection are due to insufficient protection in the event of intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denys that staff leaked the GOP senator's tasks, conceals "hazardous lies" and "conspiratory theories"
The US Congressman Maxine Waters condemned on Saturday allegations that one of her employees had posted personal data on three Republican U.S. Senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these claims were disseminated by the far right-wing extremist websites.
"Lights, lies and more deplorable lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The released information contained home addresses and telephone numbers of the Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information came online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing about the accusations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Water's office and released information about a member of Water's staff, reported Hill.
"This unexpected claim is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims - were in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Water's statement quickly got criticism online, including from White House's former press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," wrote Fleischer.
"This indicates that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they can't be angry.
They can't be defiant.
They must not question the motives of the questioner.
They must be calm and sensed."
Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water's reaction to the democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of having seemed angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was able to set aside Waters in the middle of his term of office, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Largely if true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities for these fraudulent demands.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed," she continued "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again - powerless spy parody of Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit benefits in every new film with British tilt, and the same seems to apply for this new recording of the latest Johnny English action comedin - a series of spy havens that were kicked off in 2003 with Johnny English and got new life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will vass satir about how manifestly bad we are to become the nation's new export commodity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has been given its license to cling to things renewed for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation intended for the bio-public even in non-English-speaking countries.
He is of course the crazy secret agent, who, despite his bizarre claims on smoothieglamour, has got a little bit of Clouseau, a grunt Mr Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man who Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There are one or two fine moments in the latest JE film
I loved when Johnny English approaches a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the rotor blades for a short time struck his helmet.
The talent of Atkinson for physical comedy is displayed, but the humor feels rather low and strangely redundant, especially because the "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Imposible themselves now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The Humor feels as if it is adapted for children instead of adults and for me Johnny English is not as curious and focused as Atkinson's silent movie bravader in the role of Bean.
The constantly current issue is now that Britain is in serious problems.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all Britain's agents out in the field, to the agent in the service's great dissatisfaction - an extremely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last straw of a Prime Minister who is a pompous and hard-earned figure, who already suffers from a complete collapse of his political popularity: Emma Thompson does his very best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but the script does not offer much to work with.
Her intelligence counselor informs her that when each individual active spy is busy, she must use someone who has retired.
And that means the stuttering Johnny English in its own high person, now employed as a teacher in a well-deserved institution, but who offers unofficial lessons in the art of working undercover alongside.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with its former long-lived sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, a jolly-hockey-sticks-roll where Vicki Pepperdine is close to the town.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so horribly wrong at Her Majesty's Secret Service and bumping into Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister will fall hard on the charismatic tech billionaire, who claims he can solve the British computer bridge: the unfortunate Jason Volta, which is played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssé of farssed riots: dressed as waiters, they set fire at a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos when smuggled on board Volta's luxury boat; and English triggers pure anarchy when trying to use a VR headset to get to know the inside of Volta's house.
There is certainly a lot of work behind the latter sequence, but despite the fact that the film is both charming and speedy, it has an air of children's TV around it.
Pretty moderate everything.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I can't help thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies drawing up a plan for Brits to work for a four-day week but getting paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's party Labour is considering a radical plan that means that the British work for a four-day week - but gets paid for five.
The party wants business leaders to transfer savings made through the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but keep the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would be "fit" with the party's economic agenda in favour of the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by trade union organisations Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A representative from Labor told The Sunday Times: An examination of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen in one day, but a four-day work week is an effort that fits into the party's attitude to balance the economy in favour of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, even the party The Greens who promised a four-day work week during his election campaign in 2017.
However, this objective is not endorsed by Labour as a whole.
One speaker for Labour said: "A four-day work week is not the policy of the party and there is nothing that the party agrees on."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "faceless leaders" and "snylter" on state corporations.
The shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies cannot get their entire stake back, because a Labour government can do "deductions" because of what they perceive has been wrong actions.
He also confirmed plans to put employees into corporate boards and to create so-called "Including Ownship Funds" where 10% of the private company's own capital is transferred to its employees, which then stands to receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell the TV program "60 minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their opinions.
The FBI's investigation of allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether the investigation by the Agency could have some Republican Senators change their position on the matter.
In an interview sent on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelly asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal something that would lead to a change of opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went into the hearing, I've been talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, the statement came out, and said, "Have you done it?"
He was firm, convinced, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, seems unbearable.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamic bill of thought," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all her names couldn't verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a hugely impressive display of stars that appear and an equally impressive mission; to combat world poverty.
During its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people walking to Central Parks Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event: to combat extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, according to a 2012 statement, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to combat poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you were not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, email a world leader, call or in other meaningful ways contribute to raising awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just so called "clicktivism" - people who feel that they make real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen states that more than 19 million "actions" have been registered from its supporters who have fought for a variety of goals.
It is said that these measures have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than $2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid out or financed.
The group estimates that so far the accumulated assets have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the UK between investors and actors who are engaged in "helping children to develop to their full potential", promising to give Rwanda 35 million dollars to help combat malnutrition in the area after receiving more than 4 700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, like you, we can make social injustice as malnutrition is to a footnote in history," said the ambassador of the Tracey Ullman partnership to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 measures were taken which require the United Kingdom to improve the diet of mothers and children, the government announced financing of the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes dietary programmes aimed at 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the common questions on its website: "What makes you think we can combat extreme poverty?"
Answered Global Citizen: "There will be a long and difficult way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-Apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who appear at this year's event in New York, the hosts of which are Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use its fleet in a "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports indicating the Minister of Home Affairs
The government can "if necessary" resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy players from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, the US Minister of Home Affairs Ryan Zinke has revealed, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it appears at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, Europe's southern parts," he said.
And according to him, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the waterways are kept open and, if necessary, apply blocked, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants in the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, and he noted that they are indeed the same.
"The economic alternative towards Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "day-long" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come after the Trump administration has had the aim of increasing the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, the Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2-pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the "capture of Moscow".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
They argue that Washington's opposition to the project is only driven for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers will be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was rejected by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I strongly disapprove that a third party disrupts our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Putin of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "ordinary thinker" if she is going to stand up in the Presidential elections in 2020," says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a "ordinary thinker" about her participation in the presidential election after the US interim election.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider setting up as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and it includes a woman on top," she said according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I'm going to take a big thinker to get to the president's post."
Warren weighed into President Donald Trump at the council meeting and said that he "took this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does for our democracy," she said.
Warren has been eloquent in his criticism of Trump and his candidate to the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday Warren said, "We obviously need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote that was released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own supporters did not believe that she would edge 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "faithful" Massachusetts have said that the senator should not run, according to a study by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The study showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% for a potential candidacy and 48% against it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidature include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont's Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after taking military service in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my own son goes through, what he goes through now when he is back, I can relate to other families who have experience with PTSD and some of the trauma that our soldiers return with," she said to the audience at a meeting of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back like other people, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was accused of domestic violence against a woman, attempted to prevent a report on domestic violence and gun possession in drunk state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Columbia support the questioning of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial trial against a new American policy that denies asylum to victims who flee gang-related or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and district submitted a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the defendant in Grace v. Sessions submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the policy has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and his violent gang member sons" abused her, but American officials refused her asylum application on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The state lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries that produce a large number of asylum seekers, as nations facing major problems of gang and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy amended a decision of the immigration authorities of 2014 which enabled illegal immigrants to apply for asylum to escape domestic violence.
The District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a provision is contrary to that principle", according to the friend-of-the-court report.
Lawyers further argued in the report that the policy that denies immigrants' entry harms the US economy and argues that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary labour".
In June, the Minister of Justice of Jeff Sessions ordered judges in asylum cases no longer to grant asylum to victims who fled domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asyl is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a certain social group or political opinion" said Sessions when the policy was announced June 11th.
Asyl was never meant to alleviate all problems - including all serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperata rescue efforts in Palu when the death rate doubles in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation looked increasingly bleak.
"It feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted his brigade boy in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"The ambulance collects dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is a flaw."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their ruined homes, rotting through water-damaged possessions and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, who were injured in the 7.5 earthquake were crowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who was affected by a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the hospital Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continued strong resorption.
With tearsful eyes, he told us that the violent earthquake shaken the room on the fifth floor of the hotel that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't run.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," told Haris for Associated Press and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of "mobling" with "propaganda ads"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four - page advertisement in an American newspaper about the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the American ambassador accused China of Peking using the American press to spread propaganda.
The President of the United States Donald Trump pointed out last Wednesday that China Daily paid an extra in Des Moines Register - the best selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accused China of trying to participate in the 6th Congress elections in the United States, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in American elections marked what American officials told Reuters where is a new phase in an escalating campaign from Washington intended to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war with high tariffs on each other's imports.
China's retribution tariffs early in the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states such as Iowa, which support the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador in China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and companies.
China, wrote Branstad in a debate article in Sunday Des Moines Register, “now doubles the bullying by posting propaganda ads in our own free press.”
"The Government of China uses America's dear tradition of freedom of expression and a free press to spread propaganda to by publishing paid advertising in Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, in the newsprint on the street here in Beijing you will find a limited number of different voices and will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's troubled economy, because the media is controlled by the iron hand of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most outstanding newspapers nobbed the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans scare off female voters for the interim elections through Kavanaugh-fiascot, warn analysts
Since many top republicans defend the nominated Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court, which faces several accusations of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a setback, especially from women, during the upcoming elections.
The feelings of this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the elections.
It is not possible to turn the clock back, says Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published last Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)' last attempt at an FBI investigation will be enough to calm down angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November", says Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to Washington, DC.
On Friday morning, they scanned the demonstrators "November comes!" when they demonstrated in the hall to the Senate Building when the Republicans who control the Court Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go to the ceiling," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, to the news site.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among still indeterminate women voters in suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony with charges for sexual abuse against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a setback could follow if the Republicans pushed through the confirmation.
"This has become a confused mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the Committee's vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh comes through, it is also about how Republicans have handled it and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, head of Priorities USA, a group helping democratic election campaigns, to the news channel.
But the Americans in general seem to be divided over who they should believe in in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, and the latter seems to be the one they believe most in.
A new opinion poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during their testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, as well as those of at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford witnessed to the Senate court committee last week that Kavanaugh violently attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court exposed his sex organs to her while attending a party during their time as a student at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of World Wide Web plans to start a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology expert's latest project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lees open source Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people get access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up company.
"It's an historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data great" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, to do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all are available in a browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it is up to the user who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization through data."
The idea with Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some programme developers to work with the project and a group of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are placed on the high edge overnight.
"We're not asking them for permission."
In a post at Media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994 Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an influential vote in the debate on net neutrality in recent months.
Also during the launch of the Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about this new era on the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: Priest rewarded with Victoria Cross during the First World War is celebrated
The only priest in the Church of England who was rewarded with a Victoria cross during the First World War is now celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vand received the award for his action during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a poacher four days later and never learned that he had been awarded the British military’s most prestigious prize.
A memorial was covered by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his granddaughter, Michael Van, said that it was "brily symbolic", that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded with the prize.
According to London Gazette Lt Col Vann, on September 29, 1918, led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the line of fire and led with "great bravery" the line forward before he alone decided the battle.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German poacher on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I'm very humble before."
He and his brother Dr. James Water also laid down a crane after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "a true hero's against demonstration is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and instead saw Greta Gris
Imagine this, you've stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 just to be denied watching the main event.
The show from San Jose included 13 games, including sex on the card and was displayed live at night in Britain on channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., just like Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the program suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were not impressed after they had stayed awake until the early morning hours to watch the game.
A fan on Twitter described the program change to a drawing children's program as "a sick joke".
"It was the government's decision that the content was not appropriate so early in the morning, so they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's Vice President for Marketing and Communication when asked about the broadcast.
"Greta pig, yes"
Bellator's CEO Scott Coker said they're going to work on their schedule to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we'll be able to find a solution in terms of reprice, said the Coker.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to solve this to Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the program change upset a lot of people.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was actually a government issue.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We will show five games instead of sex - as we normally do. We took water over our heads in our efforts to satisfy the fans.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "underlying" due to sexuality
The Olympic divers Tom Daley says that he felt inferior to his comrades during his childhood because of his sexuality - but it also encouraged him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize he wasn't like everyone else until he went to high school."
When he spoke in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne he said that he spoke of the rights of homosexuals to give other "hop".
He also said that he cared less about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The popular show's regular programmer, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off because of illness.
During his one-time appearance on Lavene's first program, Daley tells us how he felt "less worthy" than others during his childhood, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said: "This feeling of feeling less worthy of me and feeling different has been a real source of power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so he didn't betray everyone when they eventually found out his sexuality.
The twofold Olympic bronze Medal has become a high-profile advocate of HBT rights and took advantage of its appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to convince more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he took the floor because he felt lucky to be able to live open without any restrictions and wanted to give others "hop".
The threefold world champion said that his in love with a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - came as a surprise.
Dr. Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much in such a young age" - he participated in his first OS as a 14-year-old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Dalley, and Daley said his whole life perspective had changed.
"If you'd asked me last year, it was just about winning gold, he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that Dad did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if they got their tickets to the Olympic games in London in 2012 - where he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him: you won't be able to sit on the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally admitted he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at OS 2012 and won the bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - to dive in front of a home republic on an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song - Proud of Heather Small - a song that had followed him to the Olympics and still gave him Russians.

Mikkelson in the form of the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will record Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he has to fix the shape to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he has often been to the United States, the fivefold winner spent his day between acting cheerlead and practicing on his game in the hope of getting a chance to show off his ability.
He has never been the best of drivers, not even at the top of his career, and the 48-year-old is not in the shape of the tough track at Le Golf National, where the long ruff often misses hard.
It is not just the course that discourages, in the ninth game on Sunday, the Mikkelson Master Francesco Molinari, who, together with the novis Tommy Fleetwood, won all four games this week.
If the Americans, which are four points below the 12 single matches, have joined the wind at first, the Mikkelson match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not because he could say much else.
"He completely understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on his back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"His self-confidence is nothing wrong.
He is a celebrities and he has added so much to these teams during previous seasons and during the past week.
I probably didn't think he'd be able to play two games.
I thought he'd make it any more, but now it's what it is, and we'll have to settle for it.
He wants to be out there, like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson passes Nick Fallo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never fully lived up to the heights of his individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk said that his presence brought other qualities to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, quick, likes to joke with people and he's a good guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds so much more than just games."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can soon be a memory but:
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in last day's singles in Ryder Cup can quickly change into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a team under Seve Ballestero's leadership held a five-point advantage over the Americans but who finally won with the least possible margin with the result 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You are reminded that we led great on Valderrama, we led great on Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with distress and fist," said Bjorn (on the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and lead with 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow we'll give it all.
Go outside and do everything right.
This isn't over until we see the score on the board.
Our goal is to try to win this bag and that is where our focus is.
I’ve said it all the time, I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re well aware of what’s waiting on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Björn was pleased with his players' performances on a tough golf course and added: "I would never manage this myself.
Tomorrow, new challenges await us.
Tomorrow it is the individual achievements that apply and it is a completely different matter.
It's fun to be out with a partner when it goes well, but when you're out there on your own, your capacity as a golfer will be tested in full.
It is the message that you need to convey to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he must also go and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Björn, the opponent Jim Furyk will want players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who came home three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of great conversions during the last days of a contest, both in the winning team in Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe drove "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in response when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, Captain 1999, had gathered his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but one would like to go out as quickly as at Brookline, as at Medinah.
When the pace gets started in one direction, there will be a lot of pressure on these mid-term games.
We made our stand and placed the guys that we wanted to, you know, create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight and meets Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I joined this group of guys in this order because I think it's enough all the way," said Bjorn about his single choice.
Germany’s new warships are being delayed again
The latest frigate of the German fleet would have been launched in 2014 to replace warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will not be launched until at least next year due to incorrect systems and high costs, reported local media.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Palatinate", led by the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg Frenchmen, has now been launched up to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit magazine, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery were disastrous for the ambitious project.
The four vessels in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the fleet ordered in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen French.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a range of airborne and marine missiles, as well as certain smug technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to post the newest frigates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships - which allow Germany to project power abroad - are already obsolete when they are put into operation, says Die Zeit.
The fateful F125 Fregatt created headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
A little was known about the causes of the return, but German media indicated a number of important "mjuvaru- and hardware errors" that made the warship worthless if used on a battle mission.
Weaknesses in the software were particularly important because ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a manning of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older frigates in the Bremen class.
It was also found that the ship has a significant overweight, which leads to a deterioration in its performance and limits its ability to perform future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons heavy "Rheinland-Palatinate" is assumed to be twice as heavy as similar vessels used by the Germans during the Second World War.
Apart from incorrect hardware, the entire project's price tag - including training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have risen to a cheating EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - compared to EUR 2.2 billion in the start-up phase.
Problems affecting the latest frigates become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the German Parliament Defence Committee, acknowledged that the fleet actually "starts to lack fully equipped vessels".
The official said that this is a growing problem, because old ships are being decommissioned but no replacement vessels were provided.
He regretted that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust potions for the secret life of the bat
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunting for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help to control future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow south and dwarf pipel as well as brown lending and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special players will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using hand-held detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bats and the species that do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS nature conservation advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest fields for bats and other related species.
Fladdermuse populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have decreased considerably in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects bon and loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as aircraft and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as head tax attacks.
Fladder mice aren't actually blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts who regularly conduct investigations, examine bon and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve on Threeave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bats.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here at Treave we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of vintage trees and a variety of favourable habitats.
But there is much about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other property helps us to understand more about what they need to enjoy.
He stresses the importance of searching for bats before performing maintenance in real estate, since it is possible that the accidental destruction of a single nest could kill up to 400 females and young people, and possibly wipe out an entire population.
Fladder mice are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, trouble or disturb them or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are."
Ronaldo refuses rape while his lawyers threaten to sue the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape charges against him "False News" and says that people "won't market themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been accused of rapeing an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He claims to have paid her $750,000 to keep quiet about the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a Live video on Instagram, Ronaldo (33) turned off the reports as "falsy news" when he spoke to his 142 million followers, only hours after the requirements were reported.
"No no no no no.
What they said today was fake news," said the fivefold Ballon d'Or winner of the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all is well," said the player and log.
Mr. Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel on allegations, which they have called "an unauthorised reporting of suspicions of integrity", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged event is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he said he should have raped her anal, according to actions filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent" a "good guy" betrayed by the "last percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was in agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed on a settlement because she felt "feared for retribution" and was worried "be humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old says she's now trying to cancel the settlement because she continues to traumatize the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: Great Britain "will forever regret" to lose car manufacturers
Britain "would regret it forever" if one lost its world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, business minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "irritant" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without agreement they will temporarily cease production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event of no agreement being concluded could result in lost jobs.
The Burnaston factory - producing Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if the United Kingdom leaves Europe at the end of March we will see production stops in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that it will close its Mini facility in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems with regard to car manufacturers are risks to the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without settlement.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If Britain leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, it may lead to disruption at the border as the industry says can lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's consumption in stock in its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and hence the production would have to be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequer's plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid border checks".
"We need a settlement. We want the best agreement that will allow, as I say, not only the success at present to be appreciated now, but for us to take hold of this opportunity." he said to BBC Radio 4's programme Today.
"The statements from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we must definitely be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supplier chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term it warned that increasing costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnston for 24 years and is the leader of the Unite trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly worried: "My experience is that these jobs never come back.
A government official said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again," says White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be "shooted in another week" while the fight against the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continues, said White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of Special Counsellor Robert Mueller, who examines Russian interference in the elections, relations between Trump and Russia and the president's potential obstacle to justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, has provided fuel for Washington gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing interception equipment to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of setting aside the President via the 25th supplement of the American Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, and reports that he was due appeared.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said that he would "advise" not to kick Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate legal committee questioning where Kavanaugh and one of the women who has accused him of sexual irregularity, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date for that has not been fixed, it may happen this week, or a delay of a week, considering all the other things that happen at the Supreme Court.
But we will see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would challenge that statement: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to anything disliked against TV reporters as "playing for the gallery," although she said, "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president holds more questions than any president before him," she said, adding without citing evidence, "We've looked at these numbers."
Conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and it will replace press conferences, and you can then ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump responds regularly to questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances before the assembled reporters.
Minister for Health writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland, taking into account concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and desire for them to remain behind Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of phased-out status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public sector.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on exit have continued, for decisions expected to come in the autumn.
But the British Government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know that this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to repeat how much I value each employee's contribution, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after he has suffered head injury
Tennessee State Tiger's lineback Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after having suffered a head injury on Saturday with 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennessee's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State's main coach Rod Reed told the reporters that the damage happened just before half-time.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed," said Reed.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on a stretcher was carried out for further evaluation.
One representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operating at the Vanderbilt Medical Center hospital.
Harris added that "there is no information about the type/extent of the damage yet" and Tennessee State are trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a reshirt second year student, is in its first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which gave him a seasonal total of 18 tackle.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp taxes when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers may pay higher stamp taxes when buying property in Britain, and the extra money is used to help homeless people, according to the Tory Party's new plans
The measure will neutralise Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters
The increase in the stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom.
The UK Ministry of Finance expects to receive up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help homeless people, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of housing at more affordable prices and aiming at high-income earners.
The increase in the stamp tax will be taken out by individuals and companies who do not pay tax in the UK. The extra money will give a boost to the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
In addition to the current stamp tax, the extra charge is added, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in recreational dwellings and dwellings purchased to be rented out. It may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will raise up to £120 million per year.
An estimated 13 per cent of the newly built properties in London are bought by people living outside the UK. This drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially the capital, have become ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new play will only come a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the stamp tax to help more young people buy their first dwelling.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to refrain from quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain's "bad housing situation."
Jeremy Corbyn has launched an up-to-date range of suggestions for housing reforms, including rent ceilings and an end to eviction without the tenant's model.
He also wants to give municipalities greater opportunity to build new housing.
Theresa May says: "I said last year that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, that life should be better for each new generation.
That means solving the problems in the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who do not live in Britain, and also for companies based abroad, to buy housing as for hard-working residents in our country.
The dream of owning a dwelling has too many people just become a distant dream, and homelessness is still an unworthy fact."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to train Scotland"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says that his "final goal" is at some point to become Scotland's trainer.
The 42-year-old shots look forward to the challenge of blowing life in the club from northeastern England, which is currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light last summer after leading St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a game in the B-land team and that's all," says Ross to BBC Scotland Sportssound.
"But when I grew up I looked a lot at Scotland on Hampden with my father, and it has always drawn me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage a club."
Among Ross representatives are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he was not concerned about succeeding so established names in such a large club. He has previously refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Just now I assess success based on the answer to the question 'Can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
This club is definitely home in the Premier League, considering its structure and its talents," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably just see myself as successful here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a period as an assistant trainer in Dumbarton and a 15-month schedule as a member of the Hearts trainer team.
Then he helped Alloa get back from the descent to the third division, and lifted St. Mirren from being close to the descent to becoming the winner of the championship title season next.
Ross says he's more satisfied now than ever during his player career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a crossroads," he remembers and refers to when he took command of Alloa.
"I really thought leadership was right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had all the results and I could live up to it, and I also had some great success.
But playing can be tough.
There's a lot you have to go through every week.
There is still stress and pressure at work for me, but training feels quite right.
I have always wanted to practice and now I do. I feel better than I have ever done in my adult life."

A study shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
The summer heat wave has produced increased revenues for the country’s struggling pubs, but the restaurant chains have gained greater pressure.
Figures showed that pub and bark groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of the business advisory company CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "Continued beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in the World Cup longer than expected meant that we saw a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the pubs rose by 2.8%. However, restaurants got even more difficulty.
The fall in restaurant turnover by 1.8% in June was only worse in July.
Pubars and bars that primarily offer beverages showed the very best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pubar offering food also had difficulty in the beautiful weather, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink something.
The output of managed pubs and bars went up by 6.6% that month, and food sales down by 3%."
Paul Newman at the service and entertainment industry analyst RSM says: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and major sporting events are still the main factors for sales in the supermarket.
It is no surprise that the restaurant groups still have difficulties, although a sales reduction of 4.8% per year is particularly difficult to deal with in addition to current cost pressures.
The long warm summer couldn't have come any more difficult for companies run by food sales. The time will have to show whether the more moderate temperatures we've had in August give a well-needed respite."
The total sales increase in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July. It reflects the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
The industry sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyses information on how 47 active groups are involved with a total turnover of over GBP 9 billion, and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One in five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents.
A study shows that one of five children, sometimes as young as 11 years of age, has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey among 20 000 students in high school and high school shows an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
The result has increased the concern that it is sexual content posted there
20% of the students said they had a "main account" that they showed to their parents
One of five children, some as young as 11 years of age, creates accounts on social media that they keep secret to adults.
A survey among 20 000 students in high school and high school showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta accounts", a reference to the image-sharing service Instagram.
The result has been to worry about the sexual content being posted there.
20% of the students said they have a cleaned "main account" that they can show to their parents, and then they also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled over her 13-year-old daughter's secret page found a teenager who told others to "kill me."
According to the study, carried out by the organisations Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of children between 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted that they had private accounts.
The president of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to create places on the internet where parents and teachers do not find them."
Eilith Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" on the board of the Scottish Statutory Association, Scottish Athletics
Eilith Doyle has been elected from the board of Scottish Athletics as an external member of the Board of Directors at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most praised free sporter, and the President Ian Beattie describes the choice as an outstanding opportunity for those who lead sport to benefit from her wide experience at international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh has gained great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that the sports in Scotland would benefit greatly from her becoming a member of the board," says Beattie.
Doyle says: "I would like to be a voice for the athletes and I hope I can help and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, has a total of four Olympic gold and is now an expert commentator on the BBC. He lost the ability to go after a mini-stroke.
He writes on Twitter: "Today a month ago I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time was allowed to deport if I was to recover, and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I have recovered completely, learned to go again and now I am doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!"
Advertising for breast pumps comparing mothers with choir parts internet
A company that sells breast pumps has caused disagreements on the internet with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers with cows being milked.
In order to draw attention to the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent portable breast pump", the consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video inspired advertising film with humorous appropriations to show what freedom the new pump gives mothers who pump breast milk.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with cows to a song with lyrics like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I don't have any tails" and "If you didn't know it, this isn't a udder, but tits."
"Pump out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the advertising film, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused battle on the internet.
The film has received 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, and has met mixed reactions from the viewers. Many say it throws light over the "phases" of the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Just like we have to get pregnant and feed in order to produce milk, but their kids are taken from them only a few days after birth," says one person.

Another comments: "It is understood that it is traumatic for both mother and children.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another person adds: "What a reality-avoided advertising film."
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is "hysterically fun."
"I think this is brilliant.
I should have gotten one if I was still breast-feeding.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product," writes someone.
Another comments: "This is a fun advertising film that addresses mothers who pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like a kiss."
This is not a film that celebrates or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, the women reveal that they've all danced with the discreet pump stuffed in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely quiet, has no cables or pipes and can be worn discreetly in a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin is a partner and ECD on Mother, and she says: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By pulling a parallel between women pumping breast milk and milk cows, we wanted to put light on breast pumping and the challenges of it, while at the same time we in a entertaining and readily recognizable way demonstrate the incredible sense of freedom the new pump gives.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump creates headlines.
During London's fashion week a baby mother appeared on the catwalk with clothes from the designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrants moved in silence to a tent camp near the border in Texas
The number of children who are deprived of liberty has increased, even though the number of people crossing the border every month is relatively unchanged, partly due to the fact that the gay rhetoric and tough policies introduced by the Trump government have made it more difficult to place the children with reference people.
In the past, most reference persons themselves have been paperless immigrants, and are afraid of putting their own opportunities to stay in the country at risk by declaring themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult household members would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration agencies.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to be reference persons for unaccompanied minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested were not known by law enforcement authorities in the past.
"Almost 80% of those who are either reference persons or family members of reference persons are illegally present in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to pursue these individuals," Albence said.
In order to deal with children's cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to enter the court within one month after they were deprived, rather than after 60 days, as was previously the practice, according to staff at the offices.
Many of them are present on video link rather than personally to bring their case of legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not deemed to have the right to protection are quickly deported.
The longer children are deprived of liberty, the more likely they are suffering from anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to staff on the premises and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Proponents say that anxiety rises at larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs of a child’s being severely ignored, due to the size of the facility.
They add that if children are moved to the tent city without having enough time to prepare themselves emotionally and take the goodbye of friends, the traumas that many already suffer can worsen.
Syria requires the withdrawal of the US, French and Turkish "ccupational forces" immediately.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem underlined that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that the Government of Damascus would continue "to fight this sacred battle until we have freed all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war - torn country.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances are good for them to come home, and accused "some Western countries" of "dispersal of irrational fear" which is causing refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They police something that should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a fresh agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold Idlib has created an opportunity to proceed with political talks.
The Russian-Turkey agreement ruled out a large-scale seizure of Russian-supported Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had 'clear deadlines' and expressed the hope that a military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaida-connected Nusra Front, which will be 'decommissioned'.
UN Commissioner Staffan de Mistura soon hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government members and members of the opposition, in order to draft the post-war Constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem put the participation of the Syrian Government into the Committee and said that the work of the Group would be limited to "overview of the articles of the current Constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the election in 2020 unless his presidency ended in advance through national law and scandal, which many liberal viewers probably hope for.
In what would undoubtedly be the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!
At present, there are no signs that the viewers have grown tired.
Since 2014, the ratings at best transmission time have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and are almost three times as high, 1.6 million, on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on best transmission time, which is an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has peaked the cable list with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
"This is like a fire that people are drawn to, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC's drama "Designed Survivor", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club". She has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the elections in 2016.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Donald Trump.
Why?
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh'," says Nell Scovell to me.
In chaos there is a entertainment value.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, reports from Washington can determine the future of the case of abortion, Roe vs Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the well-being of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one has suddenly sat and looked at a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" to his book "Fear", Paul Manafor's bomber jacket of ostrich for $15,000 ("a garment filled with hybris", as Washington Post said) and the meaning of Stormy Daniel's macabre descriptions of Donald Trumps, hm, anatomy.
I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Some of what he does that makes it feel like a reality series is that he comes with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the rotational role crew and daily initiation of the Trump season (puddle argument with NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).

When I spoke to the TV producer Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sun and 27 degrees outside his house on northern Kauai at Hawaii, but he sat and owld indoors and looked at MSNBC while he recorded a broadcast from CNN.
He could not wear himself, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be faced with the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in the wavecap.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning to the end of Western civilization'," said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was some sort of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from currents into the most regular race ever before the interim election
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th Congress district receives a lot of money. It is thanks to a restructuring of a congress district that has made two members now compete for the same place.
This newly rewritten suburbs of Pittsburg are represented by the Democrat Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb campaigns against another member, Republican Keith Rothfus. He currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned after the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January that the old territories were constitutionally changed to the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a campaign financing dispute between the major parties’ economic sections, Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee, (DCCC) and National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a button win in a widely guarded special elections in March to Pennsylvania’s 18th Congress district.
That place had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts had given some advance to the Democrats.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for China aid but then backed up
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already acknowledged Beijing, with some resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama, until the partners vowed the Trump organisation's leadership team.
Officials of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs decided to call the heads of the U.S. missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for the "new decision to no longer recognise Taiwan", said the department’s spokesman Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, which received an estimated 140 million dollars in US aid in 2017. The money would, among other things, go to drug control and development and provide financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have fought hard against the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
While the internal meetings progressed, American and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
In mid-September, however, high officials in the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which in practice put an end to the consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now going to speak at the conference, which is now due to take place in mid-October, which is a sign of how important the Presidential Administration considers the meeting to be, said the diplomats.
And the three American ambassadors returned quietly to the El Salvador, Panama, and Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
One spokesperson for John Bolton of the Vita Huset declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by the three American officials, two of whom agreed to discuss the internal proceedings against the promise of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also expressed himself anonymously.
Study History
The next inevitable step can be the special investigator Robert Mueller's report on Donald Trump's alleged legal abuse, for which there is now considerable evidence in public records.
Mueller is also reported to control its investigation against whether Donald Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in its attack on the American election.
If Congress were to change majority, Trump would be held accountable to that congregation just when he was preparing to stand up again in the elections, and perhaps finally before a civil court.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not wish to claim that Trump will inevitably fall, nor his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to meet different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how the outstretched struggle can be.
In 1938 German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the Western countries had resisted him and stood behind the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbaths that followed.
History revolves around such crucial events, and the incomparable emergence of democracy is either accelerated or slowed down.
The Americans are now facing several of these crucial events.
What are we gonna do if Donald Trump gives Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what's going to happen to Mueller's investigation, fired?
Rosenstein has been in difficulties ever since this newspaper reported that he should have proposed to take the president secretly and wondered whether he would not be suitable for the office.
Rosenstein says The Time's reporting isn't right.
"How are we going to answer if the recently requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he is allowed to enter the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, in the interim elections, will we vote for a Congress that holds Donald Trump responsible?
If we fail in these trials, democracy is facing a dark period.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi line that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to the United States and 60 years later, she sent me off to light the Sabbath light on the table that was decorated with the pecks.
With that as an inheritance, how could I be anything but an optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is optimistic for the meeting with Rapid Wien
Rangers will receive Rapid Wien on Thursday. They know that victory against the Austrians after the impressive Spanish game against Villarreal that ended definitely earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of Europe League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, up to the 2-2-matchen against Villarreal. However, he believes that Rangers can use the result as a crackboard for greater success.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," says the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game in the belief that we could get something, and went from there with a point.
Perhaps we could have gotten it in at the end, but in general, it was probably a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half, and we came back in the second half and we were the better team.
Now on Thursday, it will be an important night in Europe again.
Hopefully we can score three points, but it will be a tough match. They got a good result at their last match, but if we have the audience with us, we can probably pull out and get a good result.
Last year was very tough, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The troops are good and the guys are having fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put the last season behind us and succeed well."
Women sleep badly because of fear of pension savings
Although the participants in the study had a clear picture of how they want to be taken care of, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the nationwide study said that they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the step and talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how you can begin.
Talk to your husband/wife and children: You can’t prepare your family to give you care if you don’t talk about how you want it in good time.
Work with your advisor and family and discuss where and how you want care. Your choices may have a major impact on the costs.
Take help from your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance solution, a cash-value hybrid solution to cover costs, or self-insurance with own resources, if you can afford.
Establish legal acts: Avoid legal conflicts from the outset.
Create a healthcare authorisation so that you can appoint a trusted person who looks over your medical care and ensures that the healthcare professionals follow your wishes, if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a warrant for your economy.
You then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in your place and make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so yourself.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that you have an aged parent who ends up in an emergency medical condition and is on your way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready.
"Not only the economy is at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What drugs are they?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure the plan is ready."
Ilfracombe was shot several times with air guns
A man was shot several times with air rifles when he walked home from a night out.
The victim, who is in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon when he was shot in his chest, abdomen and hand.
The police describe the shooting, which took place about 02:30, as a "single incident".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The damage is not life-threatening, and the police call on witnesses to hear from them.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the town of Palu in Indonesia on Friday. It states officials. The death figure is expected to rise.
The communications are out, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to get any information from the Donggala Management Area, an area north of Palu that is nearing the epicenter of the earthquake. The earthquake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16 000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Centrala Sulawesi, and is located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city population was estimated at 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a management area which extends over 300 km of the north-west coast of Sulawesis.
The management area, which is an administrative region under a province, had a population estimated at 299 200 people in 2017.
The pillars of the province of Central Sulawesi's economy are fishing and agriculture, especially the coast region of Donggala.
Nickel mine operations are also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times in the last hundred years by tsunamis, according to Indonesia's disaster management authority.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, western Doggala was also hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the circular seismic fire ring, which is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake at the western coast of the Indonesian Aceh province on northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries. 226 000 people died along the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit Sumatra's west coast at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale hit south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that struck the south coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with magnitude 7.6 struck near the town of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1 100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with the magnitude of 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten meters was triggered. Thousands of villages were destroyed and around 300 people were killed.
2016: A shallow earthquake affected the management area of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, when people were reminded of the devastation of the mortal earthquake and tsunami 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok. More than 500 people died, most on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists became temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaska Governor and Vice President Sarah Palin, have been arrested for abuse.
Palin, 29 years old and from Wasilla in Alaska, was arrested suspected of domestic violence, for having committed himself to a notification of domestic violence and for resisting arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska's state police.
According to the police report, he should have taken the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin is detained in the Mat-Su district and is held against the 500-dollar castle to be paid if the suspect violates the terms of the bail, according to the KTUU television channel.
He appeared in the court of Saturday and declared himself "guaranteed not guilty" when asked to give up his position, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected of three cases of less serious crimes of Class A, which means that he can be imprisoned for up to a year and $25,000 fined.
He has also been accused of a case of less serious crime of class B, which is punishable by one day in prison and 2,000 dollars in fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been accused of crimes.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now being handled by Alaska's veteran court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of having committed himself to the notification of domestic violence and of possession of weapons under the influence of that event.
His girlfriend accuses him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she had linked her son's violent behaviour to post-traumatic stress syndrome, which comes from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity supply and communications are down, and death figures are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside the centre of Sulawesi, which lies northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Movies showing when it hit the scene are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palu when tsunami struck over the coast.
Federal prosecutors claim rare death sentences for a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutor of New York is calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. It is a rare punishment that has not been executed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, should have used a rental car from the building and interior construction chain Home Depot to perform an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway on the lower Manhattan. He mean down pedestrians and cyclists in his way at the attack, which took place in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, the prosecutors have to prove that Saipov "willfully" killed the eight victims and "willfully" caused serious body damage, according to the declaration of intent on the death penalty lodged in Southern District in New York.
Both points of accusation may involve a death sentence, according to the court order.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged with a 22-point federal jury, including eight cases of murder to support protection activities, which are often used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as abuse and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "wide planning and purpose," the prosecutors said, and described at the same time the way Saipov carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and inhuman".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage and loss", says the declaration of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The southern district of New York has not been charged with a case where the death penalty is claimed for a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug addicts, but was finally sentenced to life in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced to spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The couple Rosenberg were executed both in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbek, showed a lack of repentance in the days and months that followed the attack, according to the court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was pleased with what he had done.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack after watching IS films on his phone.
He also asked to put the IS flag in his hospital room, reported the police.
He has not declared himself guilty of the 22 charges in the prosecution.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov. He stated that they are "givenly disappointed" on the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to claim the death penalty instead of agreeing to live in prison without the possibility of conditional release if the accused admits guilty merely prolongs the trauma that these events have caused for all those involved," said Patton.
Saipov's team of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Member of the House of Tories says that NIGEL FARAGE should be given responsibility for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the army of the people" today during a protest at Tories' conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must "know the heat" from the EU sceptics, when one of Theresa May's own Members proposed that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
At the March in Birmingham, the Conservative Member Peter Bone said that the United Kingdom would have already "strike out" if Nigel Farage had been British Minister.
However, the challenge facing Theresa May in getting the deeply divided supporters to be reconciled has been exacerbated by EU-positive tory members, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers agreement, alive under attack by Brexitan supporters, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU itself.
Her allies have insisted that she should press and try to reach an agreement with Brussels in spite of the setback, and force EU sceptics and Labour Party to choose between her packaging solution and "kaos".
Bone said at a mass meeting organised by Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "spola Chequers Agreement".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been made equal and that he should have received responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stood at the helm, we would have been out by now," he said.
Peter Bone, representing the Wellingborough district in Parliament, added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to flush the Chequers agreement."
He made clear his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world war to be subjects.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Bone dismissed the allegations that the public opinion would have changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British would have changed and now want to stay is totally untrue."
Brexitan hanger Andrea Jenkys from the Tory party also attended the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say: 'The Prime Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in the party and with our election workers who are on the streets and make sure that we are elected.
Put the Chequers deal away and start listening."
And she added a sharp message addressed to Theresa May: "Premier ministers are allowed to keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that politicians would have to "know the heat" if they were to betray the decision taken with the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is about the trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, 'We're not gonna let you get away with it.'"
In front of the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to get our political class, which is close to betraying Brexit, to feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain."
At the same time, EU followers marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the central city.
A group of activists waved with tracks with the text "Tory Members vs. Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
Labour parliamentarian Lord Adonis from the upper house mocked the conservatives for the security problems they encountered with a party note when the conference opened.
"It is these people who say that they can have IT systems in place and all technologies for Canada plus plus the plus agreement, for frictionless borders and free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a pure father's.
There's no good Brexit," he added.
Warren is planning a "Peaceful Wonder" to run for president
The U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to make a "ordinary thinker about running to the president's post" after the elections in November.
Boston Globe reports that the Democrats from Massachusetts talked about their future during a city house meeting in Western Massachusetts last Saturday.
Warren has often criticised President Donald Trump, and now stands up for re-election in November against the Republican state representative Geoff Diehl, who was Deputy Chairman of the Donald Trump campaign in Massachusetts 2016.
She has been the subject of speculation that she may be taking on Donald Trump 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th city house meeting with the voters since Donald Trump.
One person asked her if she was planning to run for the president's post.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government.
A person arrested for the death of the basketball player Sims from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge in Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the death shooting by LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The police in Baton Rouge announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 p.m. for ET.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to get help identifying a man who appears on the pictures.
20-year-old Sims were shot to death near Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and finally died of this," told Sheriff Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday via the news site 247 sports.
Wayde walked apart to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he had been on the scene and had a weapon, and he admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any incidents and was taken to the police in East Baton Rouge.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm long and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 starting last season, and cut in 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world championship after team orders gave him profits over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start and almost hung out Hamilton on the drought as he defended his position during the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pit first and let Hamilton drive into the back of the club, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes went into the pit a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after a little wheel-to-wheel-action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free with the risk of offering on the spot after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in the back row and lay seven at the end of the first shipyard on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race and held the tires to reach a fast finish and drive around Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
Finally, he came into the pit of the 44th shipyard but failed to speed up during the remaining eight shipyards when Raikkonen went up in fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me go.
The team has done an exceptional job and got a one and a two," said Hamilton.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday because she maintains that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as Judge of the Supreme Court, is accused of sexual abuse.
The President, who spoke at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly raise the Ford testimony before the Senate Justice Committee; instead he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "ilaka, nasty and lying."
"The only thing that could happen and the fine that has happened in the past few days in the Senate, when one sees anger, when one sees people who are angry, mean, nasty and lying," he said.
"You see press releases and leaks and they say, 'No, I haven't.
I didn't do it.'
Remember?
Have you leaked, Diane Feinstein?
Remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it.'
Wait a minute.
"If we've leaked, we haven't leaked anything," he added, and imitated the senator.
The letter with details of Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have come from her office.
"I have not darkened Ford's accusations, I have not leaked her story," said Feinstein to the Committee according to The Hill newspaper.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential as she wished."
But her dementi doesn't seem to have passed the President, who, during the Saturday night's meeting, commented on this: "I'll tell you one thing, that was really bad body language.
She may not have, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continues to support the candidate to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual crimes of three women, and he suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power by all necessary means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to gain power and control," said the president according to the Mediaite digital news site.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars zoned Friday's loss in Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return game with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Belfast Giants received an early two-way lead through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie signed up for the home team before Dwyer restored Belfast Giant's leadership.
Francois Bouchard gave a receipt to Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season of Adam Keefe's team, which came from behind and struck Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season for the two teams, and Belfast Giants had won the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening case came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave assistance when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
During the intense first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie who gave a receipt at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Belfast Giants was in charge at the first break when he made his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again acknowledged with a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen give Dundee leadership for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, and he secured the prize with his team's fifth half way through the end period.
Belfast Giants, who has now lost four of their five latest games, will play at home against Milton Keynes at his next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died for hundreds of people on a plane to escape from earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is now hailed as a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane of hundreds of people on board could lift safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a great earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful reverberations continue to plague the area and many are stuck in the brink of the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could safely lift.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died later in a hospital.
The spokesperson of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of people's lives, according to the Australian television channel ABC News.
"We arranged with a helicopter from the Balikpapan on Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
We are crushed to hear this," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the death rate may rise to over a thousand people. The country’s disaster relief authority says that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"Death figures are believed to continue to increase as there are still many bodies in the ruins, and many have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson of the authority.
Up to six-foot-high waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in help and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: "Every minute comes an ambulance with dead bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Minimarkets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross fights to help survivors, but we do not know what they will meet there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" According to CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes on Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing after an aircraft crashed in a pile
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific Ocean now states that a man is missing. Previously it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated from the sinking planet and were in safety.
Air Niugini stated in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said that it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed in the water as it tried to land at the airport of Chuuk Islands.
On Friday, officials indicated that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and how the course of events looked.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane slipped past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew in very low.
"It's extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to wade through waist - deep water to the emergency exits of the sinking planet.
He said that the cabin crew panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor baldness.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who worked nearby to develop a shipyard also helped rescue by using an inflatable boat to drive people ashore before the plane sank into the 30 - foot - deep water.
Data from Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have been killed in accidents involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analysts draw up a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's side ended on Saturday her patching in the second trial against a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
For hours, U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used mobile phone lists to puzzle the 29-year-olds appealed to Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber's movements on the night she died.
Rowlett said that he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, which contradicts his earlier claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber's cell phone during the time he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed last Saturday and said that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "juger, for my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone lists showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis some time after Chambers' death deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He pushed her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its finalisation on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hiphop?
A hiphop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that hip hops have come far away from their origins in political messages and to attack social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently gained a boost in Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
A black one again?!
A nanny in New York fits a couple because of a "racial" text message
A child girl in New York answers a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a miscarriage from the mother, who complained that she was "a black again".
The couple deny that they would be racists and compare the mood with "expression".
The two-children's mother, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed horror when she realized that the new nanny Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived at her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEELY NOT A WRITTEN IGEN", wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to his husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "like to fashion", and gave Maurice the fire, claiming that their former African-American nanny had done a bad job and that she was expecting a Filipino woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and sent home in a taxi.
Now she is correct for getting compensation for the dismissal. She asks compensation for the amount of 350 dollars per day for the job she was hired to do, which would be six months and where she would live with the couple. However, she had no contract.
"I want to show them you don't do that," she said to New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple reject the accusations that they would be racists and say that the only reason was to terminate Giselle Maurice's employment, and they were worried that they could not trust her once they had offended her.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said the husband Joel Plasco to New York Post.
"But would you confide in your children to someone you'd been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously."
Plasco compared the mood to "expressing" and said that his wife would give birth two months later and found herself in a "very difficult situation".
"You're supposed to go to such a person?
It's not very nice done," added the investment bank Plasco.
The legal process is still ongoing, but public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticises them for their behaviour and reasoning.
The Paddington publishers didn't think the readers could relate to a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Paddington author Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, commented on the letter as follows: "It is difficult to imagine what it was like for a person who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun, considering what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She told me that her father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the first edition was "bitterljuvt" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family," and added that her father was proud of her final success.
"He was quite silent by himself, and not any awesome person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds in something. You become proud of the child even if it is not you who has accomplished it.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little that way.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he used to give Paddington himself credit."
My daughter would die, and I had to say goodbye to the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that you didn't expect her to make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad who said that she would die within two minutes and that I must say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my darling.
I'll be back to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The drugs that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly ebbed out and left her body.
She had died shortly before, and now everything went out.
I just had to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I couldn't budge or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the difficult trial she was going through.
"No one knew about it," she said.
"I bent my head down, and the tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt an overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Emerging women set up postcards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have placed cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that you can call for support.
Sharon Davis's son Tyler was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression, and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to have to feel as bad as I do every day," she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney. She tells us that her son was a promising chef who had a contagious smile.
"Everybody knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smile lit up the room."
But he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his siblings after he had killed himself in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I worry about consequences all the time."
Sharon Davis created the cards "for people to know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't shut up, talk about it."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, has lost his partner for 15 years, Mark, some time after his mother's death.
"He had not said that he felt depressed or depressed or anything," she says.
"Some days before Christmas we noticed that he behaved differently.
On Christmas day he was at the bottom, and when the kids opened their Christmas gifts, he didn't have eye contact with them or anything."
She says his death was a very hard blow for them, but they have to get through it."It tears up a wound in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to fight on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI initiates investigation
"I thought that if we could achieve something similar to what he asked for - an investigation limited in time and scope - maybe we could get some agreement," said Jeff Flake on Saturday. He added that he feared that the Committee would be "split" due to deep-rooted party disagreements.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican followers want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their resistance depends entirely on the time.
The interim elections will take place in just five weeks, on 6 November. If the Republicans make a bad choice, which is expected, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the one they want to choose to the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called Senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was personal secretary to George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and confirm his election in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean shoppers "snives" under Kim
The number of North Koreans who jump to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, who quotes data from South Korea’s Ministry of Reconstitution, says that 1 127 people jumped off last year, compared with 2 706 in 2011.
Park says that tougher border controls between North Korea and China and higher charges to human smugglers are important reasons.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Finally, the vast majority of North Korea shoppers are offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30 000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most are fleeing via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Korea states.
China sees them as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back by force.
The relationship between North and South, which is technically still at war with each other, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met for talks with a focus on the permanent negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work for the Korean peninsula to be free from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the American sanctions of the lack of success since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances we cannot disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Ri in a speech in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric", and says he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
The Head of Minority of the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric" and said that he was temperamentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosis comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like that, she would be called 'hysteric'," said Pelosi on her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the charges of having sacrificed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotionally touched, and occasionally he almost screamed and the voice staggered when he spoke of his family and his years in high school.
He also expressly condemned the democrats in the Committee and said that the accusations against him were a "grotesque and co-ordinated character murder" organised by liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton losing the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as it showed that he is partial to the disadvantage of the democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way in which he attacked the Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to introduce Kavanaugh to national law if he was elected, and if the Democrats were given a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this – if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he's at now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the appeal court in Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about what decision Kavanaugh might take against the Health Insurance Act Affordable Care Act or the abortion case Roe vs. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmatory hearings, Kavanaugh avoided asking whether he would amend certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not the time for a hysterical and partial person to sit in court and expect us all to applaud," said Pelosi.
Women have to stand out.
It is a righteous criticism, months and years of anger that boils over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Ms. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual.
And she continued: "I got good help from a woman who was CEO somewhere. She said that she also cried when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying she said to the person she spoke to: 'You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry.'
And then she went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to partially vent anger because they are often misunderstood in the ground.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs in a mansdominated office, where I once cried out of indescribable anger, was that I was taken into the collar by an older woman. It was a cold boss that I had always been a little afraid of, and she dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and they're happy they managed to push you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
1987, when Hart was caught with an extramarital deal on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason to examine the idea of setting up the President himself.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, the last they needed was one.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Since she was out late, she was behind with the money collection, and promised not to go in as a candidate if she didn't get $2 million.
It was a project doomed to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1 000 to men just gave her $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in a speech that she would not launch a formal presidential election campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect money and target voters rather than delegates, and angered against sexism, that the voice staggered.
"You could've thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schröder remembers the press's reactions.
"You could have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, "What are they going to write on my gravestone?"
She cried?
Why the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The opening line in the trade war between the United States and China was ear-deaf. The war is far from over, but the gap between the countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by laying down important Chinese export products such as solar panels, steel and aluminium with customs duties.
The most important escalation came this week, with new tariffs on goods for $200 billion. In practice, that means that half of all the goods entering the United States from China are subject to customs duties.
Peking has every time responded with the same coin, and he recently sold a fee of between five and ten percent on American goods for 60 billion dollars.
China has promised to match the US's actions. The world's second largest economy is probably not going to step down in the foreseeable time.
Making Washington back means bending for demands, but publicly crawling for the United States would be way too brilliant for China's President Xi Jinping.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing plays its short right, the press from the US Trade War can give positive support to China in the long term, by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"A rapid political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic panic in either country, and it is actually much more dangerous than the viewers have previously wanted to acknowledge," says Abigail Grace, research assistant focusing on Asia at the thought tank Center for New American Security.
Syria "redo" for returning refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that it is ready to accept voluntary return refugees and calls for help to build up the country, which is in ruins after the more than seven years of war.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister, Mr Walid al-Moualem, said that the conditions in the country are now improving.
"The situation in place today is more stable and secure, thanks to our success in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build up the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian aid.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that it did not receive conditional support or assistance from countries that have supported the rebellion.
Europe departed with the victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team U.S. with the finish of 16,5 against 10,5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team achieved the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mikkelson, who had to fight hard during most of the tournament, ended up in the water at the impact of the 16th hole's par 3-track, and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari gleamed in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever done 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten out 5 & 4 by the European team's lowest rated player, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest rated player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have made his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanjore Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cup behind him, became the tournament's most successful European ever with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win back the victory.
It is about the team, and I am glad that I could help," said a touched Garcia after the victory of the European team.
He handed over the stick to his countryman John Ram who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2/1 in single on Sunday.
"What an incredible pride to beat Tiger Woods. I grew up looking at him," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four games in France, and has now the result 13-21-3 for his career in Ryder cup.
A strange statistics for one of the world's best players ever, who have won 14 major titles, which has only been exceeded by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA fought all weekend to find fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
The American captain Jim Furyk said after the team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
It was time this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the fight.
Hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played really well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the U.S. PGA tour and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going to move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to bow and puke.
They played better than we did."
Algflower: The tails decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
