Crying the World
The Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign has gone well and shouted and called out in nature has begun to pull people wide and wide across the world.
“ Your own collage, I need Iceland,” says one woman out in the big world commenting on an advertisement from the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign on YouTube topic.
Another observer will keep Iceland in her heart for all eternity, and a young woman says that she will have to get to Iceland as soon as possible, as if her fiancées were living there.
Unfortunately, however, it is in the United States, which assumes to have to wait another month.
Another observer asks if the walking path to Iceland is possible, because there are no aircraft.
Don't follow the story if he comes from another time zone.
Eric Thordson of the advertising facility Peel, who came to the advertising work together with the international advertising facility M&C Saatchi, says that there have been more hopes.
“ I came to a number of Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well, but this new campaign has already come to an end.
It's basically about creating PR values, it's getting foreign media to talk about the campaign, and it's been amazingly successful.
In a relatively short period of time, we have had a worldwide coverage of about seven hundred media outlets, reaching a total of over two billion people.
The value of that review is valued at $1.8 billion.
That's not bad."
The main market is the United States, and the campaign has gone very well there, even though the United States is not on its way to the country as soon as possible.
According to Egil, well - known areas such as Denmark, Britain, and Germany have also welcomed, such as Russia, which is a pleasant surprise.
Then there were reactions from foreign areas, such as India, which were not specifically addressed.
“ These commercials have traveled far beyond our expectations, ” says Egill, perhaps more than four million people may have watched YouTube.
“We couldn’t have wished for a better start. ”
The pictures on this page were taken by Dr. Saeberg, photographer of the morning paper, by means of an advertisement with the title “Let It Out” in the middle of the month.
The curtains went on wide and wide, such as on the paths of School in Reykjavik, in Reynisha, at Skogarfoss, at Sólheimah, and in a cave by the head of Hjorlein.
The director was Samuel Bjark Petersson, and Gunnar Paul Olaph the son of Olaph at the Scots of productions and the taker of Ottar the son of God.
Roles included the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cartenas, from Cuba and Hungary.
While dozens of Iceland’s commercials were being made, while recordings were being made in South Africa, there was another group in West and West Africa.
According to Egils, "Let It Out" is only the first part of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but it is aimed at the winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
“ This is only the first phase of this work for Iceland’s Office, ” says Egill, adding that the cooperation with M&C Saatchi was very successful.
“ Working with them is great.
In these tasks, it is important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the limits we are talking to."
Bombards: Report the position on the labour market, the funding for life, and many more

This is how she looks 25 years later
Elisa Donovan’s actress had a successful career in all aspects of his teens.
However, she had a world fame for her game as Amber in Clueless’s movie 25 years ago.
Then she also played in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch along with Melissu Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married to one child.
She has looked at it lately, but she was moved to look over the road and express herself about Clueless on a lovable TV on the day.
She talks nicely about Brittany Murphy, who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she was a great person.
“ I must admit that I built the person most of the girls I met at school who did not like me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who that person was," said Donovan about his game in Clueless.
Couldn't leave the police station at night.
About fifty cases came to the police at the capital area today, saying in the police journal that the matter was varied.
The day at the local police station began with the fact that the police had to interfere with a man who had recently been released from prison after staying there because of drunk driving.
The man would not leave after he was released and did not obey the orders of the police who told him to leave.
The man could see a continued stay at the police station because of his progress.
Then a man was arrested in the morning, suspected of a burglary in a company in Copavogi.
The police also had to interfere with two men in Breytholti because of reports of an assault.
Then, too, a woman who was serving as a snowman at a shopping center in Copavogi was unable to pay for the postprandial bill and was therefore called to the police.
Stunning was also reported on the car in downtown town this morning.
The driver of a white Renault van took off her for a while, and she was then taken out of her hand.
The car hasn't been found.
The curse of the Glory - The Horrible Destiny of the Glee Stars
The theory of the Internet is that a curse rests over the series of factors of the League of Glory, but Naya Rivera’s actress drowned in California on the days and thus became a third major player in giving life long before age.
The evidence of the Glee is a popular series of songs, dances, and joy.
They discussed the so - called joyous group of youths in high school, their love, and their fate.
Being in the joy band was not always taken out, but through singing and dancing the characters of the play seemed to overcome any situation that arose in their lives.
But outside the scenes, there have been a lot of disasters over the players and the employees of the show, so much that theories have arisen that curses are on the show.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez, a cheerleader who did not call his grandmother.
After the series of factors had broken, Rivera went to have his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and then separated them.
Dorsey refused to file a complaint, however, and the domestic violence was dropped.
On July 8, last, Riveru was reported missing after her four - year - old son was found alone in a boat on Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found sleeping in a lifejacket on board the boat and was able to tell the police authorities that he and his mother had stabbed themselves to a swim, and then Rivera would have brought him back to the boat and never returned there.
Extensive search for Rivera grew.
The day after the search began, the chief of police in the area reported that we had been searching for Rivera’s drowning.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially ruled dead.
It is thought to have been very heavy in the water and to use its last requirement to save the Son.
Cause of death was reportedly drowned by accidents.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson, the American footballer with the angel voice, who played the key role in bringing the Glory team to the way and respect.
However, outside of the factors, Moneith grappled with personal demons.
From 13 years of age, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape.
In 2013, his fellow workers felt that there was enough to do so, intervened, and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went to treatment and seemed to all look better.
Only two months after completing the treatment, Moneith was found dead in the hotel room after having gone out to have fun with friends.
Banamein was found to be a lethal mixture of drugs and alcohol.
It was not thought that there was a will.
Moneith had been treated and his tolerance to high - dose administrations had been reduced so much that the dose he had previously tolerated was fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was heavy on his associates, but under the influence of his adversarial wife, Lea Michele, was determined to continue taking the part and dedicated them to the complete memory of Moneith and Finn’s person.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah “Puck” Puckerman in the performances, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the Glory band, or all the way to his courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested in his home in Los Angeles suspected of child pornography.
At his house, we found a huge amount of child pornography, and soon the matter went public.
It was clear that Salling had finished.
He was subsequently accused and convicted of his transgressions.
He had four to seven - year - olds in prison, as well as having to be on the record of sexual abusers and seeking treatment for childish greed.
Prior to the decision of a judge, Salling, who was then released from insurance, was found near his home.
Cause of death was suicide.
It was not just the actors who fell from a long time ago.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
He soon fell asleep in 2013, only 41 years old.
We also worked with a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was a younger sister of the Great Star, Julia Roberts, and she did not carry her sister’s beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of great control and disrespectful conduct.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she struggled with severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiancé, where she gave her mother and sister the responsibility for her actions.
“ My mother and my so - called siblings will have nothing to do with me except the memory that they were the ones who caused my worst depression. ”
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of using her fellow player’s sole and superior position and with a superior star drive.
Jesse Luken took a guest role in the 2012 program.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which felt a lot of scandal.
The actress Heather Morris played a major role in the program.
In 2010, she became aware that unpractitioned computer ferrets came into naked pictures of it and published it on the Internet.
The actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner played both in the show and had an affair outside the show.
Benoist later reported that Jenner used violence in his relationship.
You can put flowers on almost everything
It increases children’s maturity when they are allowed to play in the garden with their parents to grow flowers and to watch them grow and grow.
It is also endlessly possible to make with flowers as the Swedish photographer Anna Kumel points out.
Just having time with the children in the park is something that never forgets.
They will remember the flowers, the aroma, and, of course, the precious time they received with their parents.
Acquired a boat by the tenth grade
“I don’t think we’re many sailors who work in the plaything schools of the country,” says Axel Örn Gudmundsson, who conducts beach fishing in summers but learns psychology at the University of Iceland over the wintertime.”
Beach fishing is a very comfortable summer work when you are studying.
If you fish well, you can make good money, and I find it great to be able to let it go.
The teapots also do me well into the winter," says Axel Örn Gudmundsson, 25-year-old psychologist, who is engaged in beach fishing for summer like the last summer.
Axel was new to a dock at Tálknafir, when a journalist later spoke from him at night at the beginning of the week."
“ In my tenth grade, I took the ship’s rights for boats less than 12 feet [12 m] long, and I bought my boat the summer after completing my elementary school.
I've been doing beach fishing on my boat all summer ago.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Jonathan the son of Jon, and I named the boat his name.
Hartmann was grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea, and he was very happy when he saw that the boat had his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat," said Axel, adding that he bought the boat in three million.
“ I signed a contract with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer, and the other half at the end of the summer when I had already fished.
So at the end of this first summer of my life, I had the boat without debt."
How, though, could a boy have one and a half million to pay off in a boat when he had just finished elementary school?
“ I had put up and collected money, I had been working with my father to sea when I was a boy, I had all summer fishing with him, and I got my share.
I also put my transport money in my boat fund."
Axel was born in Isafird, from where all his mother's; but he has lived in Copavogi since he was a boy.
“ I can hunt here in the west because I have a legal home at my grandmother’s house in Isafird.
I learned in this area west of my dad's rowing.
I move between the distances depending on how I feel, because this fishing area is all over the West Province.
Although I feel like I'd better be in the West, I've also given around the Snowflakes and other parts of the world.
I've also provided south, but most of all a gauntlet," says Axel, who always steals one flame in the morning and says sometimes to the sea and sings to the sky, in the alone for hours out in the ball sea.
“ The Internet in the ocean is good, so I can call you, listen to interphone and music.
I don't think it's a problem to be alone.
Of course I try not to fall into danger, but certainly, sometimes something has been weathering, but never great danger," says Axel, who is lucky that he is never seasick.
He says that the length of the working day depends on how fishing takes place each time.
“ In the beach I’m never more than 14 hours fishing at a time, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, such as in the taxi, but then I’ve been on my way to the sea for one and a half days. ”
The arrangement in shore fishing says that he can hunt 770 pounds [770 kg] a day, which he thinks is an obstacle.
“ Another restriction is that I must not hunt Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and I may only hunt twelve days a month, those four months of shore fishing, in May, June, July, and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their hunting days in the weather and nothing else.
Instead of having 48 days over the entire summer, this unnecessary pressure is to be calmed down and can be chosen for its head.
So could the land change also go for me, and a sea salmon that is well located at the fish farm should enjoy it," says Axel, who reduces most of the cod from the salty sea on his beach fishing, but also only a few other species of rivers.
Axel works over the winter with the university at Nupi High School in Copavogi.
“I don’t think we’re many sailors who work in the plaything schools of the country,” says Axel proudly, adding that he was only going to work temporarily at the high school.
“ I get stuck there because I feel like a great job.
I hope that my psychology School will take advantage of me in the future stage," says Axel, who has also studied in business science.
Error registering prevented return mitism
An error in a registration sheet that people fill out when they arrive in the country led to a person living here in the country not being called back to a tour.
A registration number is not required if the person fills the form in English, as is the case when it is made in Icelandic.
“ This will be examined in the week, ” says an expert in the field of a surgeon.
Three internal infections were identified at the National Hospital's Virological Department yesterday.
One of those who proved positive came to the country on July 15, two days after the rules on so - called home disease took effect.
The residents of Iceland are then screened at their arrival in Iceland and again announced four or five days later.
RUV’s lunchtime news revealed that the person had applied the old system.
The visa on the border was negative, and it was not called back for the virus.
Camilla Rut Sigfusdóttir, an expert in the field of a surgeon, says in a conversation with a news office that this may be attributed to a mistake in the electronic record sheet.
If you fill out the registration form in English, you do not have to insert a identifying number as in the Icelandic version.
For the first time, it had been thought of by foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person was not automatically invited to take a sample.
However, Kamilla says that many people have followed the rules on transit, even though they have filled the registration form in English, and in some cases employers have also been alert to send people back to a visa after they arrived in the country.
“ This will be checked in the week how to facilitate access to people to draw their attention to the process. ”
The man is in isolation and six have been hospitalized.
They all go to a demonstration, but two of them were starting to show symptoms.
The three infections detected yesterday are now being affected, mostly closed due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, a sequencing of the Icelandic genetic analysis has revealed that there are variations of the chronic fusion virus that have not been identified here.
In the second case, the bond has focused on Israel, although the person who moved the virus to the country has also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be past tomorrow when the other virus was coming.
A total of 15 are now in isolation according to COVID. is.
135 are in an illness.
Four out of five non-connected infections
Five internal infections have been detected in this country in the last few days.
Of these, four are unconnected and have not been found the source of the infection that came up at the Rey Cup sports convention yesterday.
Embellishment is still ongoing.
Originally, in the 30 ’ s, they were exceptionally sent to the hospital, which was reduced to sixteen.
A total of 34 are infected with these new infections, which were detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period of time that the event is diagnosed, and it has raised questions as to whether such an event should be observed.
John K. John Jonnsson, Director of Communications at the National Police Department, says it is slow, as long as people follow the criteria and rules.
“ We are constantly stressing for all those who live here that individual contamination needs to be maintained.
We also need to stress that there are certain rules that need to be followed.
Then events can be held," says Jon.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by maintaining personal protection.
In addition, the rules and criteria are subject to a constant review.
“ What needs to be done, and what is constantly being stressed by the General Guard and by the Committee on Agriculture, is a matter of concern to these individuals.
Both at home and also at service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
This prevents contamination from continuing," says Jon.
“ We need to urge people to continue on the good road that we were on, in order to sustain the results that we have so far achieved. ”
40% of the victimamba COVID-19 had diabetes mellitus 2
Devon Brumfield heard the phone in turn how difficult her father was to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes, and she urged him to seek medical help.
The next day, he was dead.
The death was attributed to sudden breathing difficulties due to the presence of a crown virus infection.
Diabetes mellitus was identified as the underlying problem in the death certificate, and Brumfield, who is also diabetic, is terrified that the same thing will happen.
The Reuters Newsman says the fear of Brumfield is not without reason.
The figures of a new study submitted by the US authorities show that less than 40% of those who died had diabetes mellitus 2 as underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached the age of 65 is considered, the proportion increases to half.
The US Disease Control (CDC) study included more than 10,000 people in 15 countries who died from the crown virus during the February to May period.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious expert at the CDC, says the results are striking, especially for those diagnosed with diabetes mellitus 2 and their loved ones.
Was hidden in the slow growth of Reuters had the survey carried out, pointing the answers from the 12 countries that responded to comparable proportions.
10 Kingdoms, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet been diagnosed with underlying diseases.
“ Diabetes was already a slow - growing epidemic.
Now the COVID—19 has broken through like a powerful age,” Reuters, according to Albert Huang, head of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at Chicago University.
Diabetes mellitus is more common among blacks and people of South American origin, who have also gone worse out of the crown virus.
One of the best precautions for people with diabetes is to keep the disease under control with exercise, a healthy diet, and health care professionals.
However, the Crown virus epidemic has made it difficult for many to keep the bus.
In this case, insulin prices have been high for some people to continue to be at work and therefore to be exposed to the virus.
Reuters points out that the US authorities may have been aware of the risks posed by the virus by those with diabetes mellitus 2.
As the SARS crown virus crossed in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease, and in the pig breeding epidemic in 2009, this group was three times more likely to be hospitalised.
When MERS did so in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to intensive care had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because the impact of the COVID-19 virus could longer have removed the cover of a number of previously unknown complications.
“I’m afraid we’ll see a flood of problems when it’s over, ” says Andrew Bolton, president of the International Sugar Association.
Physicians have warned that the crown virus epidemic may indirectly lead to an increase in diabetic complications, including kidney disease and renal excretion.
Similarly, new studies help the crown virus to lead to an increase in diabetic cases.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the link between the crown virus and diabetes mellitus 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many people with diabetes.
In this case, a high glucose and lipid ratio in diabetic patients may induce a true called “cell messenger” worm, as it is called when the immune system responds too hard and attacks the body.
Harmful endothelial cells may also lead to inflammation which may lead to fatal blood clots.
“ It’s all one big puzzle,” says Dela Cruz.
"It's all connected to the inside."
The story has been corrected.
"We were offered champagne, and they came out of the room"
Assún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason met the unusual request from the artist Ragnari Gargamelson to engage in sex in front of a camera for the work the artist was installing in Paris.
“ We loved each other so it wasn’t complicated. ”
So atli Bollason never forgets when he first met his wife and grandmother, Ásún Magnúsdóttir.
“ I was very impressed by her.
It was naturally just the radiation, but so did I find it completely unheard of.
And I'm still sorry," he says.
Assembly remembers this too, the husband regularly revisites the first meeting.
“ I always hear that story.
Last just this weekend," she says, who also attracted to her husband at the first acquaintance.
“ I felt and felt so much excitement around Atla, which I felt.
There's a lot going on and a lot going on, and I was impressed with it."
Atli says that she and her husband have stressed the need to follow their own course.
“ We don’t tie down the same knots as our companions.
"We avoid the ruins we see around us."
It is possible that they took the message from a Ragnari Gargamelson, a sculptor, even though it would be most unusual to say so.
“ Our friend, Christine Anna, is in contact with us and asks if we can come to eat dessert with him, Ragnar’s wife, Ragnar’s Ingibjörge, at Snaps.”
They accepted the invitation, met the trio of Snaps, and obtained a dessert wine, and each one of them dessert.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans for a art show that he thought would be installed in Palais de Tokyo, Paris, in the autumn.
“ He had a multiple - channel information project called Scenes from Western culture.
He described it in a simple way."
Assún says that he described the work as a dead man and a decadent late from the everyday life of the West.
“ He had sketches of all the seasons he was going to shoot, and last time he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating in. ”
Since Ragnar asked her couple to share in showing a young middle class couple to be loved in a minimal room.
“ These are initial and final intercourse, ” says Atli.
Even though Ragnar knew about him and his couple, “they knew us and felt that we fit in with them.
They had said that they did not want to advertise people.
They may have thought that they would not get the right people, but people who would get the sexual education from performing for others."
They urged Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it did not take long.
“ When we got out of Snaps, we said, ‘ Aren’t we just there? ’
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnari as an artist and all his team," says Assún and Atli.
“ It’s about love and neighboring ”
Later it was taken to a nice apartment on the Moor Street.
There was a very rare film team; the filmmaker, Ragnar, and the musician, and the couple.
After a recording, all the rooms left to wait outside in the car except Atli and Assún.
“ We had not decided how we should be.
We received some small instructions, but we tried to forget the time and place.
To be ignorant of what we were doing and for each one.
There was no game, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Assún.
But was it romantic?
“ Yes, it was a bit romantic, ” says Atli and Assún.
“ We were invited to champagne before they left the room.
It was a little like being on vacation at a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was happy with the couple’s performance in the work that moved them.
“ When Tommi looked at it, he cried, and he thought it was so beautiful, ” says Atli.
“ It’s about love and neighbor as much as the actual intercourse, ” says Assún.
The couple’s parents have seen the work and tell Atli that his mother heard the voice of the son of the Museum of Reykjavik and then realized that he was part of the work.
“ Then she turns around and starts to wonder, ” says Atli.
“ Mom and Dad saw it in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone this way, but then my dad just sent me a message and said, "Good to meet the little family in Palais de Tokyo," tears up Asrun.
And do you think the participants in the project have deepened the relationship between Assús and Atla?
“ At least we’re still together, so maybe this deepened something.
At least this deepened my relationship with the related family," says Assún and laugh.
Assún himself saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
“ I felt a little difficult not to be with you but someone else, ” she says, turning to her husband.
“ But it was nice to see this, because it’s just one late in a much bigger job, and when you saw it with the other effects, it’s really cool.
I could get a little out of this, and I was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my stomach," says Assún, who was pregnant by one of the children of the couple when she was taken up.
"It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausn spoke to Ásúna and Atla in love stories at Rás 1.
Swansea with win in the first playoff game
Swansea won 1-0 wins Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game of the past in the final round of the game of getting to the English top of the line.
The game took place at Swansea home in Wales.
The position at half was 0-0.
Homers in Swansea got hell in 64 minutes, while Andre Ayew failed the archist at the war point and gave protection.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, actor Brentford, got the red card.
So Brentford played the rest of the game less, and in 82 minutes, Swansea’s new players took their stand.
Andre Ayew added the vite cloth by cutting its mark and securing Swansea’s 1-0 victory.
Swansea therefore leads 1-0 to the solo battle, but the second game takes place next Wednesday at Brentford's home.
Send Secretary-General for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador in Iceland, is in the flashlight of the media after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard in which he feared his life.
However, the U.S. president’s mandate to serve as ambassadors has not been a real challenge.
Since April 2009, at the end of April 2009, Carol Van Voorst gave up the office of the ambassador of the United States, there has been a total absence of ambassadors on the country for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst gave up in peculiar circumstances, but Kastly reported in 2009 that she should have received the words of Fálkaða.
On the way to a farewell meeting with the president of Iceland, she received a telephone call from the Presidential Office that she would not be honored.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she taught international relations with Army War College.
16 months passed until Van Voorst's successor came to work, in September 2010.
There is some reason why Robert S. Connan had been appointed ambassador, but he refused.
Finally, during the ministry, Loius Ariige had served in the foreign service for decades.
He gave up his post in the fall of 2013 and took over the office of ambassador in Guatemala.
At that time another period of unrestrained ambassadors took place.
Robert Barber received approval from the U.S. Assembly in January 2015 and came to work shortly later, but no ambassador had been there for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed but not diplomate, but had served as a lawyer and supported Barack Obama's campaign fund.
He gave up his duties as soon as Donald Trump took over the presidency on January 20, 2017, as usual with a political ambassador.
Trump’s government was unusual in commanding both ambassadors and high - ranking officials in the Washington regime.
Therefore, two years before the United States Congress, Jeffrey Ross Gunter announced his meeting to ask him about the scepter and to confirm it as a ambassador in Iceland.
In his testimony to the council, he said he never came to Iceland, but often to Western Europe, but his wife who is dead had been broken by Dutch mountains.
Gunter is a politically appointed, formerly a dermatologist in California, and has been prominent in the Jewish League of Republicans, Republican Jewish Coalition.
The gambling owner Sheldon Adelson established them as an organization, while Adelson is a zealous supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but no ambassador had been in the country since the early year 2017, for two years and four months, the longest of which is the country.
The reason is both how long Trump’s regime was to appoint people in key positions, and that in recent years the work of the United States has been very prolonged, including the confirmation of the ambassador.
Since 2009, it has been a total ambassador in Iceland for over five years.
However, this has not prevented developments in the ways of the embassy, which opened up recent headquarters at Engagegeig.
These are considered to have cost approximately 6.5 billion dollars, but the safety walls cover the building and the bulletproof glass is in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have enough to fill the current ambassador’s sense of security, for he is said to be afraid of his life and has wanted a armed bodyguard.
IBV's former player was struck by racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, former IBV player, claims to have suffered racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets coming to the country.
This is stated in an interview with Tonny, which is published on the Ugandan Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC, who played at the top of Uganda’s division.
During the interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny discusses many things, including his time here on land, which he played with IBV, Val, and Development in Iceland.
“ When I arrived in Iceland, I did not play in the middle as I used to play.
The leader of the team was in that position, but he also had the shirt number that I wanted so I didn't get any of what I wanted," says Tonny, who played on the right side of the season with IBV.
Among the things that Tonny discusses is racism that he suffered in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when playing in Europe.
“ This once happened to me, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later, I heard about the matter, and then I asked my friend what the matter was about.
He then told me that after I seduced him, my opponent made a racist speech fall about me."
In 2014, Tonny went from Iceland to Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
There he claims to have made the most of his mistakes.
Tonny had failed to get to the Haugesund initial team, but he wanted to play more to get to the national team.
Then he asked to return to Iceland for a loan, but he came to help Val.
“ Returning to Iceland was a mistake.
I think if I had been in Norway any longer, I would have had the opportunity that I wanted," says Tonny, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway, he'd probably get further.
He wants to mean that the loan to Iceland has lost his dreams of getting to the big world in Europe.
Find a worm in a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found 3.8 a long black snake in the gland of a woman who looked there.
Doctors were able to pull the worm out using a tangle.
A study revealed that parasites were present.
CNN's reporting.
The woman had eaten sashimi a few days earlier, which is the meat of her own.
The woman soon recovered after the worm was removed, but parasites such as these are often in raw meat or fish.
After sushi rowed to bed in the West, cases of parasites that have spread to people have increased, according to CNN.
Fear of the beginning of another wave in Europe
There is now a focus on worrying about the second wave of the crown virus in Europe, where the government has taken action to re-establish the spread of the crown virus epidemic.
In Catalonia all entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelóna where infections are increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action to increase the number of infections in Spain, but in Britain, everyone has to go to Spain for a sickness at home, as in Norway, and French have been warned of travel to Spain.
The number of infections is also increasing in France and Germany, where governments are trying to balance the spread of the virus and the return of economic life.
The situation in Europe, however, is good in comparison with other parts of the world, but the incidence of world infections is approaching 300 000 a day, the most common being in America and South Asia.
Globally, according to John Hopkins University, there is a worldwide confirmed infection of 16 million deaths, and there are 644 thousand confirmed deaths associated with the virus.
Mossial Works Can Enduredly Enjoy Their Fullest
In front of the Tollhuset in Reykjavík is a big deep hole.
There are people with orange helmets on top.
There's also a big grave.
And other smaller machine machines.
The hole is closed before traffic.
But the walker class is capable, and many of us now hold back and respect the art of millions of Moses — just as they have never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least that was not taken into consideration.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, directly in front of it was a parking lot that was always covered.
People put the car there, locked the car in a hurry, and then jumped off to take care of their business in the middle of the city.
"Lively and diverse public spaces" and "attracting city walls" are a guide to the redesign of the present - day Trustplace.
The goal is to please the area and to allow the Mosquisities to be a better view of Helgadóttir at Tollhusen.
Prior to the job, there will be a square and where the area is close to the sun, it is considered appropriate for road users to stay.
The art will be lighted up, and the straw will now be made more enjoyable than before on these 142 - square - foot - long surfaces.
There will also be small “students, ” some kind of water sculptures, which offer a game and give the area a measure of mystery.
In this way, the improvements are described by Reykjavikur, a city that is currently in operation with Vetvi.
Water force, heat and electricity supply will be refurbished.
Many of them have come to their years, but the schools and cold water laws have been since 1925, and so they have served residents and businesses in the middle cities of less than a century.
Once the street is reopened after completion, cars can drive it again.
However, it will become a monogamous street, and at the same time it will create a quieter and accessible space for walking.
According to a paper on Tollhus, the house was put into use in 1971, an architect named Gisli Halldorsson.
Because a rejection skirmish reached through the house, 250 square feet [250 square feet] of windowless ground was formed to the street.
The building committee and architect agreed that such surfaces would adversely affect the overall picture, if no special arrangements were made to adorn the appearance of the house.
So the people agreed to calculate by having a permanent art project installed there.
At that time a great deal of Gerd Helgadóttir, an artist, said in the summary.
If she had worked hard on the masculine work in Germany and elsewhere.
The decision was to contact her first before the decision was made whether to compete for the job.
It was often discussed that the work had to reflect life at the port, since the port had been a life - style Reykjavik since it was made.
When she was talking to the artist, she had to embrace the idea of such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before leaving the country, where she would work with the suggestions abroad.
When she returned home, she made some suggestions for discussion.
It was immediately agreed to ask her to do the job.
Similarly, an overall agreement with her and the famous art company in Germany, the Brothers Oidtmann, had long worked with them for the installation of famous art works in many parts of Europe.
Contracts took place and did the work of art during the work of the brothers, who then saw the installation at the House of Customs.
The whole work was exceptionally well done, both on the part of Helgadóttir and Oidtmann’s brothers, says the summary.
Since then, there has been an unblemished Icelandic weather.
It took about two years to do the work that was done and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Tolhus work was completed, only 47 years old.
Preparing the transfer of more institutions to a country
Minister of Social Affairs Einar Daddarson, reports that in the near future, more public institutions will be relocated.
This was told by a minister in the program Splengissand, at Bylun at noon.
A recent announcement was made that the burning fields of the House and Humanities Institute will be moved north in the fall of the Sheep Crow.
Six fire experts work at the Agency, none of whom intend to follow the institution in the north, and the National Association of Firemen and Medical Transporters has criticised the transport of fuel.
“ I think we should take further steps in this being.
I'm preparing for further steps in this being.
More like moving," said Asmundur.
If he is convinced that the great majority of the nation want to see a greater distribution of public institutions across the country.
“I think it is necessary to make further political decisions on the transfer of public services to a country, as I was doing with the Institute of Housing and Human Resources,” said Asmundur, but he also took examples of other agencies that have been transported to land and were of great importance to communities in the countryside, such as the transfer of the Food Institute to Selfos, Iceland’s Land Goals to Akraness, and unemployment insurance in Skagasträn.
The Greatest From the Second Day of the Master’s Day
94 Iceland’s Free Sports Master’s Convention ended at the Thorsfield in Akureyri today.
A few protests were made on the second race day.
While an exciting competition was calculated for women on the Thors field, in 2014 Vigdís Jonsdóttir of FH put Icelandmet in a slings fall, which stood until Elizabeth Ruth Rúnarsdóttir of IR added the record in May of last year.
Vigdis won Iceland’s valuation earlier this summer and has been in fanciful form lately, but she has tripled Iceland’s assessment of the rest of the summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been struggling with injury and failed to reach a line today.
She had only one valid throw of five, threw 25,69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdis threw the longest of all today, or 60,08 meters in her final attempt, and at the same time set up a countermeasure.
Her land value, set earlier in July, is 62,69 meters, and so she was somewhat different.
Karita’s daughter Hallgrim had the second best draft of the day, but she improved her best performance with a throw of 50,18 feet [5,18 m].
In a gang of men, the FH, Hilmar Örn Jonsson, the Icelandic meth, won a safe victory, but he threw 73,84 metres in his next caste and set a convention.
His assessment in the article is 75.26 meters.
Guðni Val Guðnason, Olympiar and Iceland’s mega in a roundabout, won a ball-ball competition on the Thors field yesterday, but today he competed in the roundabout, which is his main subject.
The land value of Val’s gods is 65,53 meters, but he threw a maximum of 59,13 meters today and secured his victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second long time today, but he had one valid throw that worked in the second seat, a hundred and forty - four feet [49,43 m].
Havdís Victory daughter, Iceland’s long - distance mega, won the long - distance competition, but Havdís jumped the longest 6,25 meters today, nearly 20 inches [40 cm] from the Icelandic mega.
In the 200-metre race of women, the IR-person Godbjörg Jonah Bjarnadtóttir, who was in line for 24.04 seconds, was a 23.45 seconds.
In Akureyri, Godbjörg Jonah won two gold prizes yesterday, in a 100 - meter race, and in a 4 x 100 - meter message race, as well as in a 4 x 400 - meter message race today.
In a male class, Kolbeinn Hödður Gunnarsson was the first FH to mark the 200 - foot race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of the Årmann Olifer Måna Samuelson.
Like Godbjörg Jonah, Kolbeinn won gold for 100 yards yesterday as well as for 400 meters in the race.
Not guilty for $27 million Bitcoin crop
The Overtax Committee has rejected the claim of a tax investigator who demanded a fine over a man for denouncing his financial instruments that were due to the sale of the battery Bitcoin.
The committee concludes that the tax inspector had not given clear reasons why it was necessary to pay the fine.
The Board's ruling states that the tax investigator considered that the man had been responsible for the material wrong tax projections due to the financial years 2016 and 2017.
He would have neglected his financial support, which was due to the sale of the battery Bitcoin of up to 27 million, either on purpose or with a marvelous lack of shepherding.
The guilty bet the man for his behavior.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
However, in 2016, he managed to sell an electric coin for 27 million.
He would have gained with grudges in the years 2009 and 2010 when this would have been both easy and undated by a normal home computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the coins, the tax on such sales would have been very vague and unpredictable.
It would not have been possible to expect citizens to recognize such tax - tax arrangements.
He would not have avoided paying taxes on the harvest and recognized his property as an asset on the currency account.
He would have asked both experts and governors about how this would be done but without success.
Then he felt that he needed to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had lived here for only a few years when he began digging for Bitcoin.
So he would have been in a worse position than others to study complex rules that the tax authorities would not have formed a clear view of.
The man was right to believe that his taxes for these two years of income would be recalculated and pressured, but otherwise not punished.
Then he insisted that he work in Iceland and had paid taxes here in the country since 2012.
He never intended to get away from his responsibilities in an inadequacy.
The debt of guilt was of all importance and would fall into debt.
Jealousy calls out: “This one understands what football is”
Andersen Willumsson's wedding has been quite different between the teeth of people, but also aroused an impression because of his performance of the playtime with Bælllik in the Pepsi Max division.
The flashes will be in the line of fire tonight when they receive the IA on a live broadcast on Channel 2 Sport.
Then, for four reminders during the season, a Brython will take a ban, so he will not show up with a new clipping as in summer’s games up till now.
He had written “Blah, Blah, Blew ” on his head for the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won from 1-0.
“ I don’t know what exactly he was answering with the payment, but speaking of the character, this was rather a better attempt in the game.
He didn't hide.
He wants to get the ball every time and if there was someone going to equal this game then I thought he would do it or make it," said Guðmundur Benediktsson in Pepsi Max's girl, when he thought he was a Brynjolf.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
“ It’s hard sometimes to figure out what position it is.
He's looking out a little on the left when it's going to feel like a game, but he's got a very free roll in the team," said Hjörvar Hafjavnason.
Thorkell Måni Petersson says Brynjälf’s real entertainment power, and he rejoices to have such a colorful man in the department: “No one shares the fact that this is a character.
This is a fun type and I love it with my hair, and always being ready to meet and answer the interviews.
There's an amazing lot of people busy with him, who tell me that this man understands what football is.
“ I’m a entertainer.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it."
People are reading the interviews with Brännjällf, people are paying off and watching what's next on their hair.
This man is just a genius," said Mona.
The player KR says he wants to leave the partner - "I've been in touch with some B-stakeholder."
Tobias Thomsen, KR player in Pepsi Max, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to go back to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to reach the beginning of the period in his country, but to do so, he first has to terminate his contract at the KR, where the Danish branch begins before the Icelandic probability.
The partner knows I miss Danmerk and has shown me a lot of understanding," said Tobias in a conversation with Bold.
“ I’ve been in touch with some B personnel and will probably switch over before the Icelandic period ends.
There aren't many people in Denmark who can afford to pay off my contract at KR."
Then he says that he is likely to have to accept a reduction in wages in Denmark.
“A branch in Denmark has probably felt more of the virus’s economic impact than in Iceland. ”
The Hinder Bjartmar has recovered wheels for millions - now responding after discussing DV
For more than a year, Bjartmar Leosson has had horrendous interests, unlike most others.
He cleans up and saves lost and stolen bikes, bikes, and pockets.
Bjartmar has won the name “the biker ” for the week.
Yesterday, when you published a story about your relationship with Bjartmar, you became a real fantasy.
DV then reported to the Facebook group of Western Beavers that Bjartmar spoke to the man in the Eastfield and said the wallet might be stolen.
There was nothing more to read from the original writings of the electric shuttleman than the fact that Bjartmar taught him to be a thief.
Those texts have now been changed to Facebook and the headline of the original news DV updated accordingly.
Bjärtmar says that the original news of the case does not give an explanation of what really went on yesterday in Eastern Europe.
Bjärtmar said that he had received information from a victim of electrocution that it was indeed his electronics.
That information was the target owner of others, but the information was wrong, says Bjartmar.
“ I saw the guy, and I knew the shuttle, and I found out that there was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and was being searched for.
I sure hesitated first, but when I saw him preparing to leave on the shuttle, I decided to go talk to the man.
The owner was certain of his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I'm very good at things like this, but before I could finish what I had said, the man had taken away me."
Bjärtmar says that the man on the battery has just invited him to show him the receipt for the wheel and has called the police himself.
“ Yeah, great, ” said Bjartmar, “just get it straight. ”
As a result, the owner of the battery proved ownership of his battery and drove away.
Later, as reported in the previous report, the right of the owner of the electrocution reported his history on Facebook.
During this time of the year that Bjartmar has been doing this, he says that he can count on the time that he caught up with people on the fingers of another hand.
“ I’ve had peaceful relations with the most difficult people in Reykjavik, ” said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are the longest smallest brothers and sisters in the community, figs, insane people, and other people for some reason on the street.
“ The money is a hard master, and somehow the next dose needs to be financed, ” says Bjartmar.
“ My relationship with these people is really so good that I have a lot of the good people with me.
For example, people have taken treatment and taken care of themselves and then approached me and helped me with what I am doing," he says.
Generally speaking, Bjartmars is involved with wheelchairs on polite notes.
Some know of him and what he is doing and offer peacefully to show him the receipts, the wheel telephone numbers, and so on.
A bicycle thief is a major problem that has not been discussed.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police are even beginning to point people to talk to him about stolen rides.
Bärtmar disagrees with the previous DV news transfer and says that he is not a single independent police officer in a personal search for justice.
Asking if he hasn't got to the top of the ice cream with his function, and whether this isn't the primary role of the police, says Bjartmar so certainly be.
“ Of course, the police are supposed to do this, but the fact is that the police are simply not doing this.
I've been watching police drive away from a big pile of stolen wheels for pictures.
She's plainly said impotently in these matters."
“ When the cops aren’t doing anything about this, and this is just in front of your nose, and the experience has shown that I can achieve success in this category of language, why not? ” asks Bjartmar.
He claims to have achieved so much success in putting on stolen wheels, that at times he encounters his “scarfs ” on the street, that they were just right for the brighter wheels in which they had previously reached themselves.
The time that Bjartmar has called for police assistance has occurred because it is simply not possible.
“ It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault, and it’s not the owners of the bikes to blame,” said Bjartmar, and I’m sorry that the victims of motorcycling have to suffer from the emptiness of the police in this category.
The results of Bjartmar are not shared.
In many places, stories of people can be found thanks to Bjartmari for returning their possessions to them.
Bjartmar himself has long lost the number of wheels he has given, but the amounts probably run in millions, if not for millions.
The road where electricity issues, electric wheels, and shafts are heavy, but electric wheels can cost up to half a million.
On a day’s work in a high school, and every other weekend, he works in a community.
So his ride is an unpaid job that he does during his leisure time.
Lifesaving Funds and Long Shadows
In 2019, there was a great birthday year in the history of bioethics in Iceland.
True, all the streets of the 19th century had been retired from the King of Dana, but in 1919 a fund of life was established for officials who eventually became a fund of life for all public servants.
The basis for the current social security funds for public employees was then laid down with global labour market core agreements in 1969, where employment-related pension funds with compulsory and valid funding from the beginning of 1970 were agreed on.
In 1974 laws were so laid down on the basis of these agreements, and the system of bioethics continued to increase thereafter.
The career system of wage earners was not the only radical change that labor movement of the 20th century pushed forward by its bravery.
Similarly, unemployment insurance had been received in a history - related strike in 1955, and it also gradually received its demand for sick leave and medical care, significant rights of leave, shorter working hours, improvements in housing, and other important matters.
All these rights cost a great and strict struggle but, after all, proved to be a much greater and more lasting improvement than the increase in wages, which disappeared as hard in the heat of inflation as marked the postwar period until 1990, as many remember.
The attraction to the establishment of public funds for life in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although men finally agreed that funds would be actually owned by funders, the labor movement had to agree that their governments had to be appointed representatives of employers and fundmates to equal value.
In the coming years after the fund was set up, the majority of fund workers often came to discuss the social partners, but it never succeeded, and so we are still in an abnormal arrangement that representatives of funds are not in the majority of the fund’s governments.
Article 36 of the Act No 129/1997 on the obligation to provide life-saving rights and the operation of life-saving funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.
It states in the first issue that “life - giving funds should be guided by the interests of social partners. ”
The fifth paragraph also states: “Living money must set moral standards for investment. ”
In the Lisbon Fund of Traders, there are, among other things, the following provisions, which follow the aforementioned legal provisions:
The LIFE Fund is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) Code on Responsible Investments, along with many of the largest bioethic funds and professional Western and European funds.
The rules discuss how emphasis on environmental and social issues, as well as on good corporate governance, can help to improve the investment efficiency of a stock exchange.
In this way, the interests of investors and the objectives of society are combined in a broader context.
The LV believes it is important for companies, particularly those registered in the stock market, to set a public policy on: to implement good governance of social responsibility and the environment.
The fund Value, which is the largest host of the country, has set itself “a policy of responsible investments, ” and there are similar provisions.
It's all reminiscent here as an entrance to the latest fashion word of the Icelandic “shadow management”.
Since the word is new, it is not hope that it has been clearly defined, but I believe that the following definition is now “most taken”: Shadow management is when a trade union leader says in the media that he is going to send representatives of the society in the management of bioethic funds advice or instructions on how to take a stand on a particular subject.
If they do not comply with the recommendations, they will be replaced by the first practical arrangement.
If the leader does not take this into the media and does not speak of a statement, however, it is not “a shadow control ” because such communication is, of course, always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I let the reader think about how he feels “better. ”
In particular, there are two men who have tried to shape this definition when it is written, in the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
It is the hard newspaper of the newspaper Ægisson, and the money banker of Ásgeir Jonsson.
The reason for both was after Mr. Icelandair’s president, Mr. Bognis Bogason, had told them about his intention to break the agreements with airmen and pilots (replying them), and Mr. Thor Ingolfsson, President of the Security Union of Reykjavik, sent them out their recommendations to the Society’s representative in the management of the Lifeyyris fund merchants not to support the possible purchase of shares in the company, or they might be replaced.
Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, and after that, Ragnar Thorr made the same recommendation, which, of course, referred to Boga’s decision.
Nevertheless, they saw Hard and Asgeir as reason to comment on the matter in Friday’s Newspaper with great words about shadow control, crime, and the need for changes in legislation.
There was certainly a small dust to roll a heavy load, although the blessed dust had been connected and was also wiped out soon.
Since the matter is important, let us consider the matter ourselves at the end.
I referred to the scenes in the legislation on life - giving funds that are subject to this matter.
This includes the protection of the interests of the social partners and the moral standards of investment, which are further developed in the agreement of both Gildis and the Lifey Fund of merchants, as I mentioned.
On the other hand, funds should NOT look only to short - term profit - money holdings in their investments.
Such a course would be just as dangerous and would not have to be a long time to look for examples in the past, where large lending and fishing have gone to immoral adventurers and environmental organizations, with disastrous consequences.
The director of Icelandair was obviously on a high ice when he thought of wiping out a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the favor that the partner has enjoyed in Icelandic markets and weakening its position toward investors.
Fortunately, he saw and drew it back.
The time will reveal whether it is sufficient to make investments in the partner’s lifesaving funds liable to fund at the end of the day.

One of the infected persons did not have a return disease
One of the three who was diagnosed with Covid-19 on the country yesterday came to the country from the Baltic Sea on July 15, last, about a week and a half ago.
However, he is an Icelandic man who is not regularly resident here, and therefore did not receive clear instructions to carry out so - called home-transit after arrival in the country and take another tour a few days after arrival.
He was given a negative view of the border.
“But he’s in Icelandic society, and he’s actually going to go to the hospital, ” says Kamilla Josepsdóttir, a medical specialist at the National Veterinary Office and a hospitalist during his summer vacation, in conversation with the Newspaper today.
“ He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to record the identification number and if the identifying number is not recorded then you are not automatically declared in the second view.”
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually living abroad, but because of his connection to the land as an Icelandic man, he should have used it instead.
But he didn't realize it.
“ When the identifying number is not recorded, you must seek it yourself in the second video.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that this is the right way," says Kamilla.
“ It is clear, then, that while we find some way to do an automatic preaching system, we need to strengthen our information about it, even though the Icelandics do not record their identification numbers.
Or to make it somehow more obvious who are participants in Icelandic society in the registration system," she explains.
Luckily, though, a few of them came to the country, although defined as a participant in Icelandic society, still Iceland.
Only six have been sent in sickly after he was diagnosed yesterday, and these six were all in contact with him.
They will be taking a sample, but two of them are starting to show the symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
On July 15, the man received a negative view of the border.
Kamilla probably says that he was recently infected with the virus that she was not yet able to detect it when the vision was taken over.
However, she does not want to rule out the contamination of man here in Iceland, but she does not carry the virus to the country.
“ It’s not quite possible to claim that this is definitely an infectious infection because it’s been a long time since he arrived in the country that he might have been exposed here, like these two who have caused a slight conflict in connection with sports conventions. ”
However, she says that it is very unlikely that the few people around here will be around.
“ It’s really very unlikely,” says Kamilla, “but it cannot be ruled out until Islen’s genetic analysis has arranged the virus in man.
“ If we get a virus that hasn’t been seen here before, it’s almost certain that he carried it to the country.”
Pipers and bombs used against Protestants
There was a conflict between the police and the Protestants in Seattle last night.
But the protesters broke windows and set fire to fire.
45 protesters were arrested, and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racial prejudice were protested in many parts of the United States last night, but protests in Seattle supported Protestants in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one of the protesters was shot to death.
As the BBC reports, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands met in peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire in a building area and broke windows in the city’s courthouse.
As a result, the protesters ’ police said they were indistinguishable, and there were conflicts between groups of protesters and the police.
In Aurora, Colorado, the demand for justice was Elijah McClain, a 23 - year - old black man murdered by the police in August last year, least of the Protestants.
A car drove through a group of Protestants in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of National Guards came together and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26 - year - old black woman murdered by the police in her home last March.
The group carried guns and joined the ranks to close street conventions, where police were assigned to the group of protesters, who also carried guns.
At that time, 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where Protestants remembered James Scurlock, a 22 - year - old black man murdered by a white barricade in May.
Sunskjær: Not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, champion of soccer Manchester United, does not want to overdo the importance of the game at Leicester today in the final tour of the English Selection Department.
If the United loses the game, and Chelsea doesn't lose against Wolves, then the Sunskjær and his men in fifth place and thereby lose the Championship seat.
Then, however, they should still hope to be in the Master’s Department by working with the European Department next month.
“ We haven’t reached the end.
If we reach a stage against Leicester, I think people will say that we haven't had a bad time now," Solskjær said.
“ But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey, ” Solskjær said.
It is clear that the nerves of humans will be thwarted at 5 p.m., but Solskjær tried to act as if there were any other games.
“ If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
It's nothing new, and on this, the partner builds.
We've created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it's ours to use it," Solskjær said.
“ It’s not the most important game in the season, it’s just the next game.
You can ask anybody in football, the next game is always the most important one.
The outcome does not define our period, we already had many hours to define this period."
“ Bruno Fernandes’ arrival changed a lot for us, and I believe that far above we are in a better shape and much stronger spiritual than during the last period, ” Solskjær said.
65,000 infection on a day-time basis
The new infection of the crown virus was detected in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed from the beginning of the epidemic in that country.
Last night 900 died of the virus, but the last four days before the virus died more than 1,000 a day.
A total of 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to CNN, according to the predictions of the U.S. Department of Disease Control, the number of viral deaths has reached 175,000 on August 15, next.
Fearing the Second Wave of the Epidemiology
Spain’s government is now trying to recover the increased prevalence of COVID-19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID–19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There have been no more reports in one day since the beginning of May, and the reports have come at the same time that the Spanish begin to remove one of the most strict curfews in Europe.
The setback led to the British authorities’ obligation to send passengers from Spain to return for sickness.
A week earlier, Spain was on Britain’s list of secure kingdoms.
The worst thing in Catalonia, northeastern Spain, has been the government’s efforts to adjust to growth.

At this time, the curfew is now in force for 200 thousand people in the Segria County in western Catalonia.
Britain’s decision is thought to have a negative impact on Spanish economics, which rely heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists, and is bad after the journey.
Tui, the largest travel office in Britain, cancelled all the flights planned today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the epidemic, but there seems to be little interest in taking back to the scale of the curfew that has destroyed the economy in many parts of the world.
To form a picture, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken a very bad view of this, and he has likened it to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Then, France’s prime minister, Jean Castex, said that the nation “will not survive, in economic or social terms, if taken back to exile on a national scale.
A number of government officials hope that local measures that reach individual towns, cities, or areas will be sufficient to keep the virus back during the next round if it comes.
Five New Infections in Iceland - Three Domestics
Three internal infections were detected yesterday, and two more were detected in addition to the border.
Five positive Covid-19-infected subjects were identified yesterday in Iceland.
A public protection report states that one of the infections is associated with the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP Football Convention.
It has been sent to isolation and sixteen to close association with him in sickness.
The person was involved in the social work of a sports club in Reykjavik and, according to the announcement, is “only part of the sports team” in sickness.
Others who were sent in another way are associated with the man.
The origin of this infection is unfounded and is fully contagion with a state police officer's crime team.
Conventional representatives of the ReyCUP Convention have complied with the current guidelines and rules of the Pharmacovigilance Professional and Public Protection Officer and appropriate measures have been taken.
Yet, pictures of the convention took note of the fact that it was possible for a very close association to celebrate their good team on the field.
Just before 11 a.m. today, conventioners published the following announcement on their Facebook page.
“ ATH: Parents, please, respect the rules that competitions take their own things to school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do so.
Thank you for your understanding."
Another infection was detected yesterday, but is related to the infection reported last day.
Says the announcement: “Island genetic analysis has identified the infection and has revealed a new type of virus that has not been detected here. ”
There is also an infection in this case, and it is infected with isolation and 12 infected with the infection.
The third infection from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, July 15th.
He was diagnosed at the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in isolation and six who were in close contact with him for illness.
Two of them are already showing signs of viral infection.
In addition, two of them were identified at the border and are awaiting further studies, such as a procedure for contamination at the border.
In conclusion, the announcement states: The Governor’s Civil Protection Department and the offices of the surgeon urge people to be careful and careful with regard to individual infectious diseases.
If there is a doubt as to the presence of the Covid-19 virus, the same person is asked to take a sample to the nearest clinic.
Patreksfjörður says the tent area is booked about merchant holidays - other visitors
The tent area of Patrex is fully booked this weekend, according to the announcement of the West.
Visitors are asked to consider other accommodation options.
The name of the West built Bildudal, Tálknafjörður, Melanes, Redsandandandi, Hótel Flokalund, and Hótel Bäilvik as another alternative.
There is plenty to be at Patrex this weekend, for as in previous years, Skjöldborg, the festival of Icelandic sources will be held in town.
She has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in town.
This year, if weather does not make a line in an account, we can expect good attendance in the tent area, but DV said earlier today from a false prediction.
Can however expect the worst weather southward, and the hope for the Patrex followers.
The web bb.is first told us, saying that all other accommodations in town were already fully booked.
A whole apartment house caves down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live freely in Dunhaga 18-20.
Meanwhile, the owners are seeking replacement building permits, but their business has been in the system for the third year.
In one of Reykjavikur’s oldest, most natural, and most expensive neighborhoods, there is a magnificent three - floor apartment house.
The ground floor of the house is about 600 square feet [600 square feet] of store space.
Behind the house is the door of two stairwells, each holding four rather glorious apartments.
If they are between 93 and 130 square metres, most of them over 100.
The house has a considerable history.
It was built in 1959 and has also hosted video studios, the School Office, the milk shop, Joa gunsmiths, fish sales, and now most recently University Practitioner.
The house, to the point of its weight, has remembered its elephant more beautiful.
The house is now under great damage, as shown in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of the D18hf are listed in company lists among others Magnús Magnussson and Gudrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Marcus was the owner of the Penalty group and was the defender of the Penalty Society.
In the group of owners of the Paying Society, Stålskir et al.
A steel ship, etc., is an investment company called Guðrún Holy Lárusdóttir and her children.
Gudún is also the owner of a third part of D18.
Her husband, Augustus Gudmundur the son of Sigurð, once ran a steel ship.
D18 Ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009, so little has been maintained since then.
Tell neighbors that the situation of the house has been getting worse ever since, but mostly recently.
On the local Facebook page, one resident says that the house “was not very viable for the last year. ”
It may play a role in the fact that owners have been searching for a few years to change the house and the barn.
For a long time, other neighbors say the house has not been okay.
“ It’s a long time to do something nice about this spot and it’s boring that it has been pulled like this.”
Does he also say that he is indignant in the owners of the house for not having finished this, finding a common surface with the neighbors of the house, and putting that “legislative step off. ”
“Just do this in consultation with the community around it so that you can move on and finish it. ”
The “Scientology Step” that is ready to refer to is the planning process of the field that has been going on at least since 2017.
Then the owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 were met by permission to build a height above the current apartment building and behind the house, a new elevator house, and a building on one floor, along with a basement.
The building permit granted for this purpose was filed with the Committee of the Regions on Environment and Resource, and the Committee suspended it as a result of the fact that the project was not part of a dispute and that the report was not sufficient.
The city of Reykjavík started a division work and ended it with an advertisement in the State Service last July.
That organisation was also indicted, and the committee rejected it in March 2020.
At that point, therefore, nearly three years had passed since the original application for the building permits and owners of the house at the beginning.
At that time, the house had suffered considerably, and neighbors began to tire out.
When DV asked neighbors about the situation and the reaction of neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the plans of the owner of the house, others not at all.
Others pointed their anger to the city, others did not.
Others were just angry, but nothing necessarily into anyone.
Still others said that the parking lot was a crossroads, but neighbors have been using Dunhaga’s unused parking space from 18 to 20 under their vehicle.
One applicant said that he was tired of the administration:
“ That we have to go through the three-way process is absolutely amazing.
It's like the City of Reykjavik couldn't read."
Today, the house stands empty, abandoned, and neglected.
Remembering the stage of governance and the noble intentions of the owner and the years of work of those now on the ground.
When a journalist went to Dunhaga 18 years ago, a wide - open door and a garbage dump were blown.
Playstation computer and recent TV were around another trash on Earth — victims of Icelandic summer night.
It was opened in the old University Prent office, where much of the cats of the smell of the whistle were judged.
Clearly, someone has covered himself in one corner, but no one can see.
The tables of sofas and beds and several boards of geographies, which would no doubt become a book, were inflated.
At the same time, the apartment gangs were open and life in both of them.
A journalist was so lucky that he attacked the people of one of them.
The Romanians were in there to water their potatoes for dinner and invited the magazine in.
The rooms work for the employee company Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time, and they copy the source of DV that the company has paid nothing for the accommodation but heat and electricity.
Because of the state of the house, rent is not guaranteed.
Of the mail in the lobby of the house, it is clear that there have been a number of foreign workers in the last loss.
The employment of employees has not been part of the Covid-19 state, although a contraction in tourism has led to a contraction in the construction sector and these two industries have been the most effective use of the employee housing service.
Nevertheless, the homes of Dunhaga 18 seemed to have enough to do and hang the work gills and the wheat in the company to dry after a long working day in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the plight of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist named the boys in bed, the sarcasm suddenly became clear: In the best place in Reykjavik, there are 1,500 square feet of real estate.
Owners want to improve the house, and neighbors want to improve the situation, but they want to share the definition of “rewards”.
Between then sits the city's organisational area in the initial field, the victim of endless appeals and carelessness in the planning process and the stage of the dissolution of the Committee on the Environment and Resource.
In the house, such bedworkers, perhaps just those who are going to improve the situation, live when the Icelandic stop arguing.
The article was originally presented in the July 17 issue of DV.
In an overdose following a chronovirus epidemic
Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, will give 10 million pounds of a campaign against overweight, which will include a ban on quick bites, as a result of his serious illness, partly because of his weight.
It is said that Johnson will present the campaign, which has been called Better Health, tomorrow, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe rides for their homes in excess of weight and will also be attacked for the expansion of wheelchairs.
Then television advertising will be banned by 9:00 p.m., according to British media sources.
“ COVID—19 has raised us to short - and long - term risks of overweight, and the prime minister is determined that we must use the time to become healthier, more active and eat healthy food,” according to the official.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was admitted to intensive care when infected with the crown virus in the spring, and it is part of his weight because he is thought to have become so serious.
Women are more likely to fail to lead the changes
Did she say that the new constitution was the greatest step that the nation can take toward greater distribution of power, transparency, and combating corruption, and to the interests of the whole.
“ We need to change the gear a little now, and who is better at bringing about this change than the group of society that is more likely to be in these values.
There are women," said Helga.
“ Women in Iceland are famous for their women’s union.
To stand together and be together to lead changes.
So now we're just about to lead these changes."
Said she was a little anxious about the importance of Iceland as “the world’s best” in both gender equality and human rights.
“ Then we’re not as ready to look at what needs to be done.
Like the Germans, they are very conscious of their history and of all that needs to be done.
It's a lot.
We must know where we are coming from and know the story and listen to it.
Listen to the voices of the broader groups.
We don't live all the same rules here," said Helga.
She said that she was in many good places in Iceland, but she added that, as in many other areas, Iceland’s settlements were at enormous male values.
She said that politics was turning to its own interests, authority, and power, which were the forces that held a difference in every community.
“Women are now setting up this group and coming together and are just a little frustrated by the fact that the Allingon is going to move to overlook this 2012 national vote,” she said.
“ That’s the female value we’re thinking about.
Based on human rights and nature protection, cooperation and the fact that we are all actually sitting at the same table," she said, adding that the above-mentioned values were the default in the new constitution.
“ We are a very rich land of natural poverty, and it is ridiculous that people live in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can change,' said Helga.
“ It is ridiculous that there is some natural law that women’s jobs are always lower.
It's ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses have to stand forever in a fight just to get the humane pay."
The signature list for a new constitution can be signed here through an electronic Iceland.
Trying to rob a walking roadman in the middle of town
A man was arrested in central town last night after he threatened the walkers and tried to get some money from him.
The police also stopped the manufacture of drugs in Årby, where two were arrested for the case.
In that case, the police stopped the motor vehicle driver in the Holes where his driver was at a speed of 146 km, with a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of driver’s rights.
The main city police had enough time to turn to the night, and over 80 cases were recorded in the police journal from five yesterday to five this morning.
Then there was a great deal of noise reports for groups.
On Saturday night, 11 noisy parties were announced, and they felt very much in the police diary.
Last night, though, 22 noises broke out on a police board.
Six were stored in a prison cell last night.
In Farmers, the police were called to night when people shot fireworks.
However, they had escaped when policemen came.
Then nine drivers were stopped for drunkenness and or for drug driving.

At that time, two of them were moved to an emergency room after they fell on their face, one on the middle and the other on the west.
One person was transferred to an accident department after he was hurt by jumping to trampoline in Copavogi.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver who pulled a trailer on Kjelarnesi yesterday.
According to the police journal, the trailer trailer was in “very bad condition, ” and it was stopped.

Thickness of the disease, some of which start to show signs of the disease caused by the crown virus
In the last three days, five of them have been diagnosed with the crown virus, most of which are unconnected.
There are dozens of them, and some of them are beginning to show signs of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were identified by the crown virus in the country yesterday and two by border.
An expert at the surgeon’s office says that an increasing number of foreign-infected populations do not necessarily say that the virus is spreading throughout the community.
“ There’s been a series from the first internal infection, and there’s a virus that hasn’t been seen here before, so we don’t have any special reason to think that she went to the community for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very careful now," said Kamilla Sigriður Josephsdóttir, an expert in the field of the surgeon’s office.
Most of them have been infected with people from abroad.
Further screenings are being carried out in the near future, but some who were in contact with the infected are starting to show the symptoms of the crown virus.
“ Now is not a flu going on and reminds us of other respiratory infections, so we can be quite liberal in doing these tests on individuals who at the time of the flu had a reason to do something else first, ” said Kamilla.
There is mostly an end to infection, but it is not possible that more people will have to go to the hospital.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending sports events.
It has raised questions as to whether such events should be defended.
As long as people comply with standards and rules, public protection is slow to say so.
Kamilla says that it is virtually impossible for the infected to get infected at the sports assembly.
“ If there are no more people in isolation from these individuals after having been associated with them at these sports assemblies, we can insist that our convention sicknesses have worked.
But it hasn't been revealed," said Kamilla.
The work of the Human Protection Department is under constant review.
“We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if this seems to be a reason,” said Kamilla.
After more than a week, there are thousands of people who have mass limits.
This new situation may affect reluctance.
“Align Think of Cooking ” - See Elisa Vidar’s menu
Elizabeth Vivarsdóttir is an achievement in soccer and plays with Val.
She is also a master of nutrition, a mother, and serves as a foodist.
It needs a lot of energy for today’s breast - feeding, and it usually takes time to cook good, nutritious food.
My normal day begins with coming to work from eight,' says Elisha.
“ After work, I go to the store to prepare for dinner before I pick up my girl at high school at about three o’clock. ”
Elisa feels very nourishing to attend her daughter early in high school.
“ It’s good to have time with her before I go to practice the second part.
After practice, it's good to come home and just have to warm up the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one thing to empty her mind."
Elisha does not follow a certain diet.
She is putting her final hand on a masterpiece in nutrition and knows what is suitable for her to eat in order to have enough energy to do her work, school, family, and practice.
“ What suits me is to eat a variety of foods that are well composed of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.
However, I feel that it is most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not to classify food in bad or good, rather nutritious or nutritious.
It's all right to eat everything, just not everything at all, and not always."
Elisha is very interested in cooking.
“ I feel that there is some thought about being in the kitchen to cook and get it very much.
I have to say that my confidence is in the kitchen with me, and I really believe I'm a nice chef."
Breakfast: Hafers, chia-seed, hemp seed, salt, a little lemon juice, lay in a almond milk over the night.
The top of this meal with every existing meal.
Most of the time, it's banana and mutila and KAFFI jumps.
I'm a big coffee lady.
Between: Unbelievably different, but fruit or vegetables, flat cakes, pure shirts with bananas and musli, bread with an onions, and so on, I could eat hummus with a spoon up from a box if that is the case.
Lunch: I often make all kinds of food-rich salads from what is in the fridge, quinos, or barley, falafels, cleats, baked vegetables with a good dressing are a bit of what I'm working with.
If the organization goes completely out of hand (which often happens), then the egg machine at work has helped me save a lot, and then it's two toasters with butter, cheese, and boiled eggs, no more.
Interlocution: Bring me something of a carbohydrate for exercise, a bread with an onion, a cereal, or a fruit.
Dinner: Fish are very often exposed to the choice in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Conflict between the police and the Protestants in Seattle
The city’s authorities in Seattle, Washington, have declared a state of rebellion in response to a large number of protests in the city.
Yesterday the police seized a blast bomb and a pepper spray to try to rust a large area that Protestants conquered, stretching across many blocks of houses near the House of the City.
On Twitter, the police announced that at least eleven Protestants had been arrested and that an investigation was carried out at a damage station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
The civil and police authorities say that the protesters stoned the police with stones, bottles, bombs and other loose bombs and one police officer was taken to a hospital where his injuries were done.
However, the Seattle convention was peaceful for a long time.
It was for them to show a consensus between Protestants in Portland, Oregon, but there have been severe conflicts between Protestants and heavily armed federal police forces in the city.
As in other U.S. cities, people gather under Black Lives Matter, remember Georges Floyds, who was killed by a policeman in Minneapolis on May 25, protests systematic racism in American society, and calls for an extension.
Not revoked until after voting
It is not yet possible to recall the statements made by Icelandair, who are due to take place at the next month’s convention.
An electronic vote on the Icelandic Flight Ladyship Agreement is due to the end of tomorrow's Icelandair airline.
Mr. Liney Jonnsdóttir, the president of the Society, is confident that the Icelandas will not decide on the statements until the vote comes to its conclusion.
“ This is really hanging out together, ” says Godlyla Liney.
“ There have been no cancellations; this must be done so that man’s machines can be reached.
Of course, people are anxious to know if they will have a job after the month's assembly."
This is a contract signed a week ago, on July 19th.
It is expected that it will take effect until the end of September 2025 and will be based on a contract previously concluded by the flight attendants.
On July 17 Island’s International Labour Organization, the government and confidence council approved it as a vote.
It never came to her, but this was decided after Icelandair’s decision to quit the Airfleet Society, give up all her flight attendants, and look for contracts with another union.
In that case, the community pilots were to take on the work of insurgents on board temporarily.
Asking how she believes that the vote will go, says Godlath Liney, difficult to explain.
“ People are sore after Icelandair’s mission, when all the flight attendants of the community were dismissed and reported that the agreement would be made with another union.
Now it turns out whether it's affecting," she says.
940 flight attendants worked at Icelandair at the end of April, when 900 of them, about 95%, were terminated.
Their period of notice is different, for those who have the lowest career, he is three months, and so ends at the month's session of July- August.
Of these, about 90% of the Icelandas are flying.
What does the contract take, then, will it not be approved?
“ Then we wish to continue our discussions with our fellow workers.
With this deal, we're meeting Icelandair's requirements.
If he is rejected, it is clear that flight attendants seem to have gone too far."
A vote on the Convention ends and Icelandair will present a second quarter tomorrow.
A flight girl's vote on a new core agreement ends at noon tomorrow.
Icelandair will also be released for the second quarter of the year, but preliminary results indicate that social income decreased by 85 percent from the same period in the past.
An electronic vote on the Iceland’s Climate Change Agreement and the Icelandair Business Association began on Wednesday, July 22, and will end tomorrow, on Monday, July 27, at noon.
Those who have the right to vote on the contract are Icelandar's employees who pay social security contributions to the airline company.
Icelandair and FFI signed a new convention on Sunday 19 July, while Friday before, Icelandair had broken discussions with the company after the flight attendants closed the previous agreement in a vote at the beginning of July.
Then Icelandair had told all the flight attendants and flight crews on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new convention was signed.
According to a new core agreement, flight attendants have to fly five more hours a month for the same basic salary.
The core agreement is for the year 2025, where pilots and flight attendants have been integrated on how long they can fly on one watch.
The contract was presented to the FFIs at a meeting of the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday, and described many flight misses to which the newsroom discussed them about dissatisfaction from the contract.
Most, however, seemed to agree that the agreement to keep the FFI alive would have to be agreed.
For the second quarter of the year, Icelandair will be released tomorrow, while the EBIT community, its operating output for financial damage and taxes, is negatively negative for the preliminary supply of US dollars 100 to 110 million or about 15 billion dollars in Iceland.
Icelandair sent a preliminary calculation to the Copenhagen Council last Wednesday, where it said that the income from the community was worth about $60 million in the quarter or $8.3 billion.
By the end of the quarter, about $21 billion, about $14 million had an equivalent.
Icelandas also aim to offer part of the Society in August.
Icelandes are about to conclude contracts with fifteen creditors, governments, and Boeing aircraft manufacturers before the end of the month before a partial delivery.
New variant rather than new type of virus
“ A new virus just means that it has been a person from abroad.
This is not something that has been grounding in this country," says Már Kristánsson, head of the National Hospital Infectious Disease Department, reports that “a new type of virus” has been detected in this country.
Three internal infections were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One identified had taken part in the social work of a sports club at the Rey Cup soccer convention, while the source of the infection is unfounded and the infection is under way.
A person who came to the country on July 15 was also diagnosed as infected, and there are two who were in contact with him starting to show the symptoms of COVID–19.
There was a diagnosis of infection involving yeasts reported last day and after sequencing in the Icelandic genetic analysis, “a new type of virus that has not been detected here.”
Immunisation is complete in connection with that infection.
It may be stated that it is not a new virus but is the same virus that has spread worldwide, i.e. a new crown virus, SARS-CoV-2.
It is better to talk about a new variant of that virus than to a new type of virus.
Ask what that population and whether it might say something about the beginning of another epidemic, says Már, as is a single case, and there could be no more of it.
“However, if domestic cases are emerging that are not connected to a foreign country and have the same genotype as this particular variant, it could be concluded [from the second wave], but it is premature to support this,” explains Már.
Happy in the hot pot
Is the secret of the happiness of Iceland hidden in the hot pots?
The BBC programmers liken a fun video that sheds light on the starry eye and hotspot culture of the country.
The Icelandic bathing community is unique worldwide, and it is claimed that no one in the world has as many bathing places as each of its inhabitants.
The natural heat of the earth is its foundation, but it is also the tradition of pollution.
Children’s health education was regulated in 1940, while older citizens are less successful in using hot water for health benefits.
Health traffic is described as a solid part of the country’s general well - being.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class and position.
Lest at the mobile phones, people discuss personal notes around home and space, or the benefits of the likeing power of water: contemplation and charge of the battery of soul and body.
On the brink to attend a hundred days of election
Hundreds of days are until Americans go to elections and choose the president for four years.
Donald Trump is looking for a re-election, but he's supposed to be on the brink.
Joe Biden, the prospective Democratic Party, has a lot of advance on Trump on a national scale, taken into account by polls.
According to the new AP newsman survey, the estimated American population is wrong.
Also, Trump’s reaction to the world epidemic of the new crown virus is very unfriendly, and more Americans still believe that the president has mistreated the economy.
In particular, only two out of ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent claim to support Trump’s response to the epidemic, and 48 percent say he had a good financial record.
In March it was 56 percent, and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the average FiveThirtyEight, Biden follows 49.9 percent on a national basis, but it follows Trump 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to draw attention from his performance toward the epidemic that Biden, promotes so - called cultural debate, and promotes policies that are designed to turn to law and order.
However, Biden’s efforts to keep her eye on Trump are very likely to be successful if the election is actually about how Trump has been working in the last four years.
The unfriendly Trump also seems to come down to the Republican Congressmen and fear the future that the Democratics could even achieve the majority of the U.S. Senate elders, who have so far been very qualified.
Politico told us in the days that he would follow classes and candidates comparablely, and it is now that the Republican class would have its greatest horror for decades.
Foreigners have proved to be particularly bad in the 2016 Congress and are now looking forward to further developments.
In recent days, Trump has tried to scare the inhabitants of the suburbs to follow them, including by saying that he will become President Biden, will destroy the suburbs of the United States and will promote racial conflict.
Among other things, Trump has broken down regulations from the time of Barack Obama in the White House, which was designed to increase diversity in the suburbs.
At that time, he urged the U.S. “wife ” to read an article by former assistant director New York, who claimed that Biden would destroy the U.S. suburbs and supported Trump.
“ The Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and the American dream.
I will keep it, and even do it even better!" said the President.
The population of the U.S. suburbs is growing.
According to the NPR, they are about half the total number of voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received a majority of votes from this group but lost for Barack Obama.
The polls have shown that despite the fact that Trump secured a small majority in the suburbs of 2016, its follow-up has been significantly tightened.
Although there are differences between the surveys, Biden has measured about 15 percent - size advances on Trump in the suburbs of recent years.

Will the Olympic Fire be the light at the end of the passages?
After a final decision was made to postpone the Olympic Games, events that have only taken place in World Wars, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic Fire would be famous “the light at the end of the gangs, ” and this was likely to point to the world epidemic of the crown virus through which the world is now moving together.
Africans have an additional year to prepare themselves, and Japanese authorities have increased the cost of delay.
Everyone, though, keeps a lot of head at stake.
When Tokyo, Japan, was announced to be the scene of the Olympic Games this year, the gladness of the Japanese representatives was genuine.
They wept and laughed for a change, for Tokyo had applied to keep the 2016 games, but they bowed down for Rio in Brazil.
This time Tokyo and Japan would bathe in the attention of the world.
The games were scheduled to take place on July 24 through August 9, but they have been postponed for a year, starting on July 23, 2021, and ending on August 8.
If they fail to keep the actors, if the crown virus is still too high a threat, the actors will be stopped.
Yet, no one wants to think to the end.
Olympics are no ordinary sports competition.
There is nothing to save, the show should always be wonderful and seek to top the last game.
A city of choice for Olympic Games is based on the assessment of the election committees of the cities' presentations.
The grander the introduction — the more likely it will be.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to keep the 2016 Olympic Games, or over $20 billion.
The second time, when the games were applied for in 2020, there were 75 million dollars, about ten billion dollars, put in the presentation.
Thus, in 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo was given the actors this year, the Japanese authorities had spent nearly $30 billion on the assignment.
However, this amount is just a drop in the sea, based on the cost of building Olympic villages, stadiums, and generally strengthening the interior of the country to cope with such conventions, preparing them, and keeping its own players alive.
Organizations in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympic Games, which should have been going on these days but have been postponed for about one year because of the crown virus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a government accountant report in Japan, published at the end of last year, noted that the cost was almost double that figure.
The cost of delaying the games may not be fully assessed, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two to six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
Thus, the total cost of the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could run from $15 billion to $30 billion.
It is so high that all the tax revenues of the Icelandic state were only good for less than half Olympic Games, given the lowest possible cost.
Olympics are an event of the magnitude that they have often become the focus of economists who try to look at numbers and see the benefits and benefits of the games.
In most cases, it seems that many have concluded that the effects of Olympic Games are less positive for the economy of the cities that keep them.
The short - term effect is some, for example, a very short - term increase in the number of jobs, but for a long time cities often sit up with shoulders and a horrific business cost of little used human activity.
Rio, Brazil, has been in serious debt for the 2016 games and has been in trouble with the maintenance of all the major athletes built for the actors.
Figures have been made after the games in London in 2012, but it has been found that only 10 percent of those who received jobs related to Olympic Games in the city were unemployed before.
This means that only a small amount of new jobs were involved.
In general, cities have not been particularly successful in maintaining Olympics financially because of the huge cost of activation by the actors.
However, the benefits are often considered to be an increase in the traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympics after the games, although they are very uncertain about the 2021 actors.
It is also uncertain whether all the crowds who usually pick up the games can be accepted.
The main thing, though, is the honor the cities have to be powerful, but it is difficult to appreciate for money.
Even so, despite enormous costs, it may also be said that the joy that the games bring is not that it can be put on a prize.
Of course, while the show is often magnificent and there is no saving, it is not just about money.
It's the sports heroes who are in the foreground.
For some Africans, it's just surprising that it's welcome to delay the games.
For example, in his article on the Olympic Games page, Chloe Esposito, the Australian five - challenge woman and the gold prize winner, is a kasola and had been far away from a good fun spot for the 2021 players, but there is no hope of being in competition for the 2021 players.
It is therefore among those athletes who are just rather content with the temptation, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who wanted to quit this year, they would have been held at the right time, in some cases delaying the games means that they quit the race before the games take place.
Just don’t trust your body to go through more years of hard practice.
Few athletes came to the heart of the audience at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio and Simone Biles, the fantasy star.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has been attending several interviews in his own country in the United States recently to discuss the Olympic Games.
She's planning on the 2021 games, but she's not sure if she can still be at the top of the games next year, because it's 24 years old.
While it is generally not considered to be high - age, it is more appropriate for a woman in the first row.
“ This is a sensitive issue,” says Biles, but smiles at another interview published on the Instagram page of the Olympic Committee, asking if she is going to reach the 2021 games as long as she did in Rio 2016.
“ I just don’t know if I’ll still be on top after another year of practice, ” says Biles.
In the past, she has said that her body is unable to withstand the pressures of gymnastic training much longer.
Nevertheless, she is zealously training for the 2021 Olympic Games.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to stop suddenly practicing when the world epidemic was at its top and the gym was closed.
There were no exceptions for Biles rather than others while all the athletes were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic gold could not buy any access beyond the others; she needed to find ways to stay in shape like others.
The basic form is certainly a little better than most people do.
“ We have a rigid plan now.
It was hard to start practicing first after the gym opened.
We started slowly, but we're back on track, and I'm going to get more and more practice in the course of the year.
Of course, we do not know exactly how these games will be, or whether they will be held, but we still practice, considering that they will be, can do nothing else.
I've put too much pressure on myself to leave the sport now," says Biles.
With it, as with other blobs of doubt or perhaps rather aware that the situation may arise that the games will not be held at all in 2021.
But predicting that is hopeless.
In July 2021, no one can know what the situation of the Crown’s pandemic virus will be like and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympic Games on the basis of their annual attendance.
Maybe the Olympics will be the light at the end of the Covid passages.
The Time of Marriage for the Epidemiology
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding because of the crown virus.
She was to marry the former Bachelorette competitor Wells Adams this summer.
“ I think there are other more important things to think about right now, ” said the actress in a conversation with People.
“ We want to get married sometime and have the dream wedding, and we have all of our loved ones.
But we decided to put it on hold and focus on what is important now, and it is helping to share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I look more around the world than weddings these days.
There are many things going on, and we should focus our attention on what is happening in the world."
