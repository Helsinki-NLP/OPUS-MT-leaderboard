The US Gymnastics Association supports the US Olympic Committee's letters and agrees that it is absolutely necessary for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs can be better served if we proceed with a meaningful change in our organisation than if certification is removed.

It confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils often cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The researchers say that this animal's spring suit was chestnut brown on top, with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
It also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
As dinosaur springs do not have a well developed shaft, so-called coil, but other characteristics of springs – rays and bis Rays – the researchers concluded that the coil was likely to be a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of springs indicates that they were not used to fly but instead of temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that the specimen shows an adult spring suit and not chicken down, even if the tail comes from a young dinosaur.
The researchers meant that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers rather than young down.

The work carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by Sagittariusgalaxen.
The effect the research team was looking for would be caused by forces similar to the tide of the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of Vintergatan.
Just as the moon exerts traction on the earth, causing tides, the Winter Street exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Researchers found that the dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter does.
This theory says that the majority of dark matter around a galaxy is located in a kind of halo, and is made of lots of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
"In an interview he said that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming because of the very high level of mortality."
Some patients may have been infected by the bacteria in the hospital, think Dr. Moll, of which at least two were hospital staff.

"Your thermal behaviour is not as stable as large caves on earth that often keep a relatively constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground," says Glen Cushing at the United States Geological Surveys (USGS) team for astrogeology and at the Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona."
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: the voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a suppressed paper sheet with their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After officials have verified the voter’s identity, the voters place the envelope in the ballot box and sign the voting document.
French electricity sector legislation codifies the approach quite strictly.
Since 1988, the valurns must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those duly counted from the competent voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers who are under extensive supervision and who follow specific procedures.

In her second race, the large slolom, she ended in a tenth place in the sitting group for women, with a combined time of 4:41.30. It was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first place with the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth place with the Hungarian Gyangyi Dani.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group were unable to finish their ride and 45 of the 117 total participants in large-scale skiers were unable to put themselves in the competition.
The Madhya Pradesh police took back the stolen laptop and the mobile phone.
"Vice Inspector General D K Arya said, "We've arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile and laptop."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Detective Chandra Shekhar Solanki announced that the accused were in the court with their faces covered.
Despite the fact that three people were in the house when the car collapsed, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services cut out the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to a hospital at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to the Addenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been accused in Edinburgh's Sheriff's Court of Justice of murdering his son.
She is in custody pending prosecution and trial, but all eyewitness evidence can be worthless because her picture has been widely published.
This is common elsewhere in Britain but Scottish law works differently and courts have considered the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson at Dundee University notes that "journalists choose a dangerous line if they publish images etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which has the overall responsibility for prosecution, has stated to journalists that no further comments will be made before prosecution.
According to the leak, the document deals with the leak on the border, where the Palestinians want the borders to be based on them before the six-day war in 1967.
Other topics reported are Jerusalem's future, which is sacred to both nations, and Jordan Valley.
Israel requests ten years of constant military presence in the valley after an agreement has been signed, while PA only agrees to leave such a presence for five years.
Hunters in the additional pest control trial would be closely monitored by the parkers when the test was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, volunteers were recruited during Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and culture at NPWS, the four shooters who were selected for the first shooting mission received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martellly swore a new ECP of nine members yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth interim electoral council within four years.
Last month, a President's Commission recommended the resignation of the former interim electoral council, as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the extensive protests against the regime that started in October.
The partial violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have fallen due since 2011.
There have been reports of about 60 cases of error-constructed iPod overheated, causing a total of six fires and causing four people light burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry (Meti) said that 27 accidents related to the units were known.
"METI announced last week that Apple had informed of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company called "indistinct."
"The Department replied by calling Apple's suspension of the report ""very regrettable."
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Department of the North Marian Rescue Service announced that no damage was reported in the country.
Also Pacific Tsunami Warning Center announced that there was no indication of tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has kept tourists from Hong Kong hostage by cutting their bus in Manila, the Philippines huvustad.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle against the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have so far been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers changed location with an older lady because she was in need of toilet visits. Mendoza was shot down.
The place followed in its father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He trained as a delivery doctor and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While he was working at the hospital, Lagins began to investigate for early births during his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would be fast on the foetus's lung moth.
"Xinhua reported that the government investigators carried two black boxes on Wednesday."
Brass colleges also praised Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first boss. Luna died during the night with two moons. Pretty unique just like her. Strong woman."
"Dustin ""Goldus"" Runnels said in a comment that "Luna was as big a freak as I ... maybe even bigger ... love her and will miss her ... hopefully she has the better where she is now.""
Of the 1,400 people questioned before the federal elections in 2010, the number against Australia to become a republic had grown by 8% since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the campaign of the federal election in 2010 that she felt that Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the survey participants share this view that Queen Elisabeth II will be the last monarch in Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of the respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalr would have swimmed 100 m and 200 temporis as well as three stagette races on the Commonwealth Games, but due to his troubles there have been doubts about his condition.
He has not been able to take the medicines needed to overcome his pain as they are banned in the contest.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number so far, on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery with different hardware and software at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Kilometers may have been a source of water resources on earth, along with organic material, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Since comets collapsed with the earth long ago, scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the earth was formed.
Cuomo, 53, entered into his reign earlier this year and signed last month a legislative proposal to legalize the same sexed marriage.
"He referred to the rumors as "political nonsense and nonsense."
He's wondering if he's going to stand up in the 2016 presidential elections.
NextGen is a system that FAA claims would allow the plan to fly shorter distances, save millions of litres of fuel each year, and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite technology, unlike older ground radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transport is put in, and trains over land will not stay at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride stations are not available at the ground level.
Fear of lack of means of transport opened for the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without team supporters.
A study published in Science magazine on Thursday reported on the formation of a new bird species in the Euphoria Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University reported that the new species developed in just two generations, although this process was thought to have taken much longer because of breeding between the endemic Darwinfinken, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant Españoladarwinfinken, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn to thin thread that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled in sheets.
"It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that sometimes it was used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called "informed manuscripts"."
This is called pH value for a chemical. You can make an indicator of red cabbage juice.
The juice from the cabbage changes shade depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH is obtained from the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Connect the two dry powders and form them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The houses Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with flushing in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Waste system residues have been found in the houses of the minoic cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman society, toilets were sometimes part of public bath houses where men and women stayed together.
When you call hundreds of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space gets the signal and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was sent out into space using the rocket. Researchers use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere distorts a little of our light and field of view.
It takes a giant rocket of over 30 meters to get a satellite or a telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing the wheel has brought is to give us much simpler and faster transport methods.
It has given us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antilopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including loose pets) eat a much larger amount of small prey such as insects, rodents, ewes and birds.
The secret behind their successes is the concept of a niche, a particular job for each cat that keeps it away from rivalling with others.
Lions are the most social cat animals, and live in large groups called flocks.
Flocks consist of one to three related adult males together with as many as thirty females and kids.
The females are often closely related to each other; a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lejob acts much like flocks of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly like lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly for its prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (but not well), swim, jump long distances and drag with five times the strength of a strong human being.
Tiger is part of the same group (the genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can rust.
Tiger's roaring is not like the sounding of the lion, but more like a meaning of funny, screaming words.
Ozeloter likes to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, worms, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ozelot hunt are much smaller than it itself.
Scientists believe that ozelots follow and find animals to eat (exchange) through the smell, by snorting on the ground where they were found.
They can see very well in darkness with dark vision and also move very sneaking. Ocelots chase their prey by melting into their surroundings and then throwing themselves over the prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small stock) is separated from the main stock from which they originate (for example, if they move over a mountain chain or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily recover) they often end up in a different environment than they were before.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different functions or adjustments than they had previously needed.
The indigenous people have not changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
With time, when the new population starts to adapt to its new environment, they start to look less and less like the second population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe and they take up carbon dioxide that humans emit (i.e. breathe out).
Plants produce food using sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses of plants and make our clothes of plants. Much of the food we eat is plants. Without the plants the animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain during his time, so it had nothing to be afraid of, except other mosasaurs.
The long jaws were obsessed with more than 70 knife-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the mouth, meaning that there was no chance of escape for anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a clumsy tongue. Its diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasauris, and it may even have been cannibal.
It also attacked everything that came down into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
Although most of their food would be known to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual celebrations, such as wild boars, birds, snails, and a kind of rodent called Hasselmus.
Another difference was that while the poor men and women ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they could sit half on the side while they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman meals may not have contained food that came into Europe from America or Asia in recent centuries.
For example, they had no corn, neither tomatoes, cocoa, nor potatoes, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods considered to be the home of God.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to appease the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple and then an inner sanctuary to which only the priests had access.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, known as ziqqurate, were built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's lives took place outdoors.
Women cooked food on the farm; shops were just open dishes facing the street. The stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, therefore wood was very precious.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic fairy tales, Erik the Red was deported from Iceland as a punishment for murder, and that when he traveled west, Greenland found and baptized it to Greenland.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimå tribes already lived there at the time.
"Although every country was "Scandinavian" there were many differences between the peoples, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland."
If you've seen the film National Treasure, you might think there's a tax map on the back page of the Declaration of Independence.
It is not true, however. Although there is something on the back of the document, it is not a tax map.
"On the back of the declaration of independence the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" were written." The text appears on the underside of the document, up and down."
No one certainly knows who wrote it, but we know that the large parchment (with dimensions of 75,6 cm x 62,2 cm) was rolled together for storage early in its existence.
So it is likely that the text was only written there as a label.
The landings of the day D and the subsequent blows had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
"It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who agreed with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the intruders instead of fighting them."
"On August 15, 1940, the Allied Southern France invaded, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the French free forces had liberated southern France and turned to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significant group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from Latin civilism, which means citizens, and civitas, which means city or city state, and which also somehow defines the size of society.
Urban states are the forerunners of the nations, a civilized culture means that knowledge is transmitted between generations, a backward cultural footprint and a fair distribution.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical tracks, and are not recognized as real civilizations.
During the American War of Freedom, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the only component - according to the confederation articles.
The Congress lacked all the power to introduce taxes and, since there was no national exercise of power or jurisdiction, the authorities of the States, who were often unworkable, fell to implement all of its decisions.
Nor did it have the authority to repeal tax laws and customs duties between States.
The articles unanimously required the approval of all states before they could be added and the Länder attached so little importance to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy’s national football team, together with the German football team, is the world’s second most successful team and was champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, bike, ice hockey, roller skating hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest one is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Japan is often regarded as an archipelago with its many islands in a geographical sense.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 14th century when European sailors who passed past registered island names like Ilha Formosa, which means beautiful island.
In 1624 the Dutch Eastern Indian company founded a base in south-west Taiwan and initiated a transformation of the production of cereal origin and employs Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683 Qing dynasty (1644-1912) strengthened control over Taiwan’s western and northern coastal areas, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of Qingimperie.
After the defeat of 1895 in the first Sino-Japanese war (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Shimono Sheiki Treaty, through which sovereignty over Taiwan is given to Japan, which then controls the island until 1945.
Machu picchu consists of three main structures, Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Temple with the three windows.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like in the original.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues today.
For example, the most common format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly, its image relationship is inherited to the format of digital camera photo sensors.
The 35-mile format is, slightly confusing, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The situation in this format (divide by twelve to achieve the simplest whole-digit relationship) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS format) correspond to this image relationship or are close to it.
The highly abused and often ridiculous rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while keeping a certain order in a picture.
It is claimed that the best location for the subject is where the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally meet (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was examined.
For over a thousand years, despite their differences in languages and customs, Christian religion had united European states.
The present power of its universality affected everyone from king to common man.
One of the principal teachings of Christianity says that wealth should be used to mitigate suffering and poverty and that the church’s funds are for that very purpose.
The central power of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle was fulfilled.
Soon after the conflict broke out, the United Kingdom began a sealock against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective in cutting the necessary military and civilian supplies, even though this block breached generally accepted international law codified in the majority of international agreements over the past two hundred years.
Britain's memory of international water to prevent all ships from crossing entire areas of the sea, which made it risky even for neutral ships.
Due to a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited underwater warfare.
In the 1920s the prevailing attitude was pacifism and isolation among most inhabitants and countries.
After seeing the horrors and ferocities of war in World War I, countries wanted to avoid repeating such a situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States of America in 1884 to start working at Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents on his pocket, a poetry book and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
The old China had a unique way of distinguishing different periods of time; every stage in China's history, or every family sitting in power, was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable period where the provinces were divided. The most famous of these periods were the three kingdoms, which played between the 60 years between the Han- and Jindynasties.
During these periods, violent warfare often took place between many nobles who fought about the throne.
The three kingdoms were one of the most bloody times in the history of ancient China when thousands died in the battle to sit in the highest chair in the great palace of Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects such as the use of the meter system, a transition from absoluteism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, the professions were opened up for all applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to clear the successes.
The same applies to the military, as the rank within the army was now based on calibre instead of class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed people from the working class in other countries to make a revolution.
"Muhammed was deeply interested in subjects beyond his everyday life. He often visited a cave which became known as "Hira" on the "Noor" mountain (light) to consider."
the cave itself, which survived the course of time, provides a very clear picture of the spiritual tendencies of the Muhammad.
The cave, located on one of the mountain peaks north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's actually not easy to find even if you know it exists. Inside the cave it's total isolation.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from within the cave.
The great pyramid in Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exist today.
Built by the Egyptians of the third century B.C.E., the Cheops pyramid is one of many great pyramidal structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
"Gizaplatån, or "Giza Necropolis" in the valley of Egyptian Death, contains several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several smaller tomb monuments, several temples and the great sfinx."
The Cheops pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor Khufu’s wives and family members.
"The Marking for "uphill-bread" looks like a V and the Marking for "down-bread" like a clamp or a square that doesn't have the bottom side."
Up means you should start at the tip and press the string upwards, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the string) and pull the string down.
A vigor usually generates a softer sound, while a bottom line is stronger and more resolute.
You can draw your own markings, but remember that the printed string marks are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The curious King Louis-Charles, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and King's sister, Madam Élisabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a bunch of market women.
They went back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd screaming and calling out threats to the king and the queen.
The crowd forced the king and the queen to keep their wagon windows open at large.
On one occasion, one of the participants in the mob swung off the head of an Imperial Guard killed at Versailles, in front of the white - colored queen.
War expenses for the conquest of the Philippines by American imperialism were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were required to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover most of the cost and interest on bonds in the Philippines government’ name through Wall Street’s banks.
Of course, the great profits resulting from the extracted exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
To understand the temple masters, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the system.
The era of events is often referred to as the period of European history in the 1000s to the 1300s.
The meal was preceded by the older middle ages and followed by the late Middle Ages, which formally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that embraces many different ideas in practice, from the fact that technology is driving the development or the technological immersive in the strict sense that man's fate is driven by a fundamental logic associated with the laws of nature and how they manifest in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: that technology development itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has ""effects" on societies that are original, rather than socially conditioned."
For example, it could be said that the motor vehicle will inevitably lead to the construction of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically sustainable for only a small number of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, leading to the invention of new healthcare technologies to repair damaged bodies.
Romanism contained a large element of determinism originating from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic context, the geography formed individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to this geography arose, and those who were consistent with the place of society were better than arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter for luxury began to circulate at about 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
Its influence decreased in the 1300s mainly because of the fact that crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued higher than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title Mode Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 1100-1200s and the 1300s.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to the slow channels of communication, the western styles were able to follow for 25 to 30 years.
towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of time due to the crusade was that people started using buttons to attach clothing.
Self-sustaining agriculture is agriculture that is carried out for the production of enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-catering agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses stored seeds originating in the eco-region combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers committed self-sustaining farming and so is it still in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by society and let them find their identity.
Subcultures can be distinct because of the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that determine a subculture as distinct can be of linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical character, or it can be a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belongings through a distinct and symbolic style selection, which includes fashion, mania and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialisation is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who, by neglect, accident or deliberate abuse, were not socialised by adults during their childhood.
"These children are called "wild". Some wild children have been shut in by people (mostly their own parents); in some cases, the surrender of the child was caused by the rejection of a child's serious intellectual or physical disabilities."
Wild children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma before they have been abandoned or moved.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wilderness on their own.
When the wild child is raised entirely by non-human animals, it shows behaviour (within physical limits) almost entirely identical to that of the specific breeding animal, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, support learning goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a support for people learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of support, but it is also the little gem-man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalized in the software and is intended to challenge, guide and explain methods that may have been too challenging for the student to manage themselves.
Children are placed in foster homes for many reasons, from neglect to abuse and even with blackmail.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not shallow, caring or pedagogical, but it happens.
We believe that the foster home system is a safe zone for these children.
Our family home system should provide safe homes, loving care providers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
Fosterhem is to offer all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they came earlier.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and intermediate communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of user theory.
For example, "learning" and "socialisation" are proposed as important grounds for concern for Internet use (James et al., 1995)."
"Although "personal commitment" and "continual relations" were identified as new motivation aspects of Efhmey and McCord (1998) when examining the audience's reactions to websites."
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro expression, facial expression that lasts a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
"Oliver Sacks showed in his writing "The President's speech" how people who can't understand speech due to brain damage can still judge sincerity correctly."
He even claims that we share such knowledge in interpreting human behavior with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of pronounced variation.
Segregation and re-combining pushes variations back and forth between the two poles for each new generation.
Out on the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like man to satisfy his need for amino acids from the plants available.
In addition, there is a lack of this serious impact; inhibited growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest, unless prepared.
As a comparison, animal food (tours, termites, eggs) is not only lightly digested, but also offers high-quality proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
"After all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in about the same way as chimps on the savanna do today."
Sleep breaks are the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you closer to consciousness without awakening you completely.
If you usually turn off the clock in your sleep, you can put it at the other end of the room, so that you have to go up out of bed and turn it off.
Other biodynamic-based alternatives involve drinking lots of liquids (especially water or tea, a known liquid driver) before sleeping, which means you have to go up and pee.
The amount of inner peace a person has correlates to the amount of excitement in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present life force. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that is in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but has been extended by the path of love within mahayana and many Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple; it consists of Kundaliniyoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With kundaliniyoga, kundalini energy (information energy) is available through yoga settings, breathing exercises, mantran and visualizations.
Gudyogan is central to Tibetan meditation. By visualizing different gods, the energy channels are cleaned, the chakran activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, the differences in system, process and culture led to the collapse of the countries' cooperation.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be physically fought through contract armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
At 17 September 1939 the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganise along the Romanian bridge head.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800 000 soldiers from the Soviet Union entered into and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland and at the same time broke against the peace agreement in Riga, the non-competition pact between the Soviet Union and Poland and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the sea is to use vessels to transport goods.
The work of the fleets has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while disrupting the enemy’s ability to move people and goods.
One of the most remarkable latent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to move troops and materials across the Atlantic to help the United Kingdom.
At the same time, the German fleet, mainly with the help of submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Getter seems to have been domesticated only about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains of Iran.
Antiken's cultures and tribes had them to get milk, fur, meat and skin.
Tamgettes were usually held in cooks walking on hills or other pastures, often rolled by shepherds who were many times children or young people, similar to the more famous sheep shepherd. These methods of mowing are still used today.
Tramways for wagons were built in England already in the 1500s.
Although carriageways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, those horses that led them to achieve higher speeds and to draw greater loads than on the back of the time.
Slips were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realised that the tracks would be more efficient if they had a layer of iron at the top.
This was to be the practice, but the iron was going to be more on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In time, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. The first rails were fully ironed in 1767.
The first known mode of transport was hiking, people began to walk upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning the established man) saw today's light.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of going upright.
Bipedala specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have gone on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can engage in the environmental movement, and we can also become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is, in many cases, symptomatic treatment, but if we do not just want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and disable them.
It appears with all the desirable clarity that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems have worsened because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
After its adoption by the Congress on 4 July, a handwritten draft was sent, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, to John Dunlap's printing office a few blocks away.
"During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides"."
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon at the farm in Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which was read to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 of Dunlap’s broad pages that are still known to exist are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The handwritten original has not been preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still there today. We call them birds.
Many do not think of them as dinosaurs, since they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things in birds that still look like the dinosaurs.
They have feet with mountains and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two back legs like a T-Rex.
As much as all computers used today are based on manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1 and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits to use PCjargong.
Internal poisoning is not always immediately noticeable. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general for an immediate diagnosis to be made.
The best sign of poisoning can be an open can of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term bag is used in the formal sense of entomologists for this group of insects.
This term originates from ancient kinship with wallless insects that are sharply adapted to parasitic people.
Both roundskin bags and wallless bags are busters, adapted to stay in its host's residence or home.
In the United States, there are about 400 000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest, or for the good of their children, to raise a child.
These couples can choose to draw up an adoption plan for their child.
During an adoption, the biological parents waive their rights so that another couple may raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method is indicative of almost all research.
However, it is not alone. To experiment, where an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions and make observations, also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle’s view on all scientific issues, including psychology, was accepted.
When Greek knowledge decreased, the Western world was found cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms of physiology and behaviour are often largely due to the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not just reactions to external periodic signals have been documented in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
A biological watch is a self-propelled oscillator that repeats its cycle for a period even in the absence of external impact.
Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used disciplines, or viruses, to plant their own DNA in a bacterium.
They did two experiments that marked either DNA on the substance with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the substance with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells can be inherited to children, while mutations in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of experiencing the landscape, including its plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is to visit, photograph and learn more about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural cities in cars to go to their jobs and pass by others whose destination for work is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is somehow interconnected with, and supports, a transport system based on private carism.
Science now shows that this massive coal economy has debilitated the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human development over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. In principle, everyone complains over transport systems.
Similar complaints about water quality or bridges are rarely heard in countries.
Why do transport systems generate so much complaints, why do they fall on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is it something more basic that happens?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows as processing cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
As is well known, motorists tend to behave consistently; thus, the traffic tends to flow in fairly consistent ways and can be presented mathematically in large terms.
To better represent the traffic flow, connections have been established between three main variables: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions help to design, design and operate facilities along the roads.
The Insects were the first animals that flew. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid the enemy easier and to find food and partners more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to trap their wings along the body.
This gives them more small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Today are the only insects that can't trap their wings of magic and day.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchos said that the solar system was moving around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many believed the opposite; that the solar system moved around the earth, including the sun (and also the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the world’s most water-rich and second longest river. Its water flow is more than 8 times as large as the second largest river.
Amazonas is also the widest river on earth, 9 km wide in some places.
All 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the rivers of the earth comes from the Amazon.
The main bird of the Amazon River is 6 387 km. It gets its water gets thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the pyramid building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids in Giza’s size and construction technology were never exceeded.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom were amazed at the monuments of their predecessors, who at that time were good and well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants; it is the world's smallest independent country and the country with the lowest number of inhabitants.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and in official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known of basic chemical substances such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity, as these can be discovered in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The Philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything consisted of one or more of a total of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four phases of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he had theories that they switch to new substances to create what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many different elements in the periodic table.
Substances such as calcium and potassium are counted as metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic substances such as coal.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit in the point at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the lead pen was a faithful companion for many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, when more recent writing methods have been developed, the leader pen has been given lower status and fewer uses.
Today people write messages on computer screens, and never have to get near a pencil sharpener.
You can only wonder what it will become of the keyboard when something newer comes.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to achieve a core of many protons and neutrons.
Just like rolling a heavy wagon up a hill. To climb the core again, frees part of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable cores, and much is not needed to break down.
The surface of the moon consists of stones and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The hull is about 70 km thick on the right side and 100 km thick on the right side.
It is thinner under the moonyard and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the adjacent side because the crust is thinner there. It made it easier for lava to climb up to the surface.
Content theories revolve around finding out what causes people or what appeals to them.
Theories claim that people have certain needs and/or requests that are intertwined afterwards they become adults.
These theories look at what makes some people want what they want and what in their surroundings makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's need hierarchy and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"In general terms, two behaviors may appear when managers start leading their former casts. At one end of the spectrum, the boss tries to remain "the "one in the gang"."
This type of manager has difficulties in making unpopular decisions, performing disciplinary actions, evaluating performances, assigning responsibilities and keeping people responsible.
At the other end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognizable person who feels that he or she has to change everything the team has done and make it his own.
After all, the leader is the most responsible for whether the team succeeds or fails.
This behavior often results in divides between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams keep the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members tend to act as a contact point for the physical group.
They often have more to say than conventional team members when different time zones can affect when their teams can meet and this may not be understood by the management locally.
"The presence of a truly "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team."
"The "invisible team" is the management team that all members report to. The invisible team sets the standards for each member."
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation? An objective of starting to use organisational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and invention can be flourished.
Therefore, the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer’s needs.
Before an organisation can become innovative, leadership must create an innovation culture, as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuous approach as a method used to support organisations in achieving a higher performance level.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, which is why the field of research is becoming narrower and much more precise.
The correlation between brain diseases and behavior supports researchers in their research.
It has long been felt that various brain damage, trauma, diseases and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technology allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we haven't seen in the past.
This provides us with much information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that includes machine behavior, learning and intelligence.
AI research is about making machines automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnosis and questions, and also recognition of hand style, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, which focus on offering solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in economics, medicine, technology and military applications, and has been built into several home computers and video games software applications.
Field studies are a major part of teaching in each class. Often the teacher wants to take the students to places where there are no buses.
The technology offers solutions with virtual study visits. Students can look at museum objects, visit a aquarium, or admire beautiful art sitting with their class.
Sharing a study trip virtual is also a good way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet school in North Karolina each year design a website about their trip to the capital of the state; the website is made in every year, but previous versions may remain online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing. Students often start their blog experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of readers improves this in general.
As students often are the most critical readers, the bloggers try to write better to avoid criticism.
Blogting “in addition, forces students to become more aware of the outside world”. The requirement to satisfy the readers’ interest stimulates students to be clichés and interest-seeking (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand learning far beyond the traditional school day.
"Protective use of blogs ""can give students the opportunity to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet material, students can define their positions in relation to what others have written, and account for their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada’s charming bilingual capital and offers a range of galleries and museums that show Canada’s present and past.
Further south lies Niagara Falls and in the north there is Muskoka's beautiful, unspoilt nature.
All of this and more, Ontario identifies what outsiders consider to be the quintessen of Canada.
Large areas further north are very sparsely populated, and some are nearly uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: African Americans live in the United States more than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and its own continent in terms of fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or belong to France, and are known as luxurious resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the territories, which had a great impact in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 14th century after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama rounded the Godajuppsudden and thus found the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordering in the north to Sahel and in the south and west to the Atlantic.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is good to also wear a ring (not just one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they would view as harassment, and it is not unusual that someone follows you, grabs your arm, etc.
Be determined when you say no to men and don’t be afraid to stand on you (cultural differences don’t make it okay!).
The modern town of Casablanca was founded by berry fishermen during the thousandth century B.C.E. and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merenidians as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city of Daru l-Badya, which was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping throughout Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as Tagine, Ceramics, Leather Products, Water Pipes and a whole spectrum of crimsons, but it all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located all the far east of the border to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the volcano Nyiragongo, which buried most of the streets of the city, especially in the central parts.
Goma is quite certain, but a visit outside Goma should be made to see what it looks like with the fighting in the northern Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing on the volcano Nyiragongo along with some of the cheapest traces of mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price for the short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
"Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, remote locations."
Today Timbuktu is a poor town, but its renomé makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was included on the list of threatened world heritage because of the threat from the desert spirit.
It was one of the major entrants of Henry Louis Gates PBS program Wonders of the African world.
The city stands in stark contrast to the other cities of the country, with an arabic atmosphere rather than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and extends along the border to Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, while the southern border is Crocodile river.
The park covers 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which has different wild animals.
It is one of the largest sights in South Africa and it is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANCOParks).
Like all other South African national parks, the park takes out daily nature conservation and entrance fees.
It can also be beneficial to buy a Wild Card, which either provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to Hong Kong’s territory and is the place that many tourists view as the main focus.
The buildings in a row that make up Hong Kong's silhouette have been likened to a glimmering stack diagram reinforced by the water in Victoria's port.
To see the best views in Hong Kong, leave the island and go to Kowloon's lakeside opposite.
The vast majority of the settlements on Hong Kong Island are densely packed on previous seabeds along the northern coast.
This is the place British colonists took over, so if you are looking for evidence in the colonial past of the area, this is a good place to begin.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal manpower belt in the world and extends 80 km into Bangladesh and the Indian inland from the coast.
Sundarbans has been adopted on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part of the forest located in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not only mangreträsk — they contain some of the last remaining stands of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sunbarbane covers an area of 3850 km2, about one third of which are wetlands.
Since 1966 Sundarbans has been a reserve for wild animals, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 axish shirts in the area.
Buses depart from the district joint bus station (over the river) all day, but most, especially those headed east and Jakar/Bumthang, go between 6.30 and 7.30.
Since buses between the districts are often full, it is a good advice to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are operated by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxi cars are a quick and comfortable way to get to places nearby, such as Paro (150 Now) and Punakha (200 Now).
The bridge across the Oyapock River is a cable bridge. It extends across the Oyapock River and binds the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guyana.
The two towers rise 83 meters up, it is 378 meters long and has two passages that are 3,50 meters wide.
The vertical free height under the bridge is 15 meters. The building was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be operational in September 2017, as Brazilian customs stations are expected to be ready.
Guarani was the most important indigenous group of people who occupied the current eastern Paraguay and lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was populated by other groups of native tribes such as Guaycuru and Payaguaá, who lived as hunters, collectors and fishermen.
"In the 1500s, Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of India", was born as a result of the meeting between the Spanish conquerors and groups from the native native natives."
The Spaniards began the colonization period lasting three centuries.
Since the Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has succeeded in retaining much of its domestic character and identity.
Argentina is well-known because their polo team and players are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament in the year takes place in December at the polobanes of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and games can also be seen here during other times of the year.
For tournament news and where to buy tickets for pomotatcher, turn to the Asociacion Argentina de polo.
The official Falkland currency is the Falkland pundand (FKP) whose value corresponds to the value of a UK pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged on the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley opposite the store FIC West.
GBP is usually received everywhere in the islands, and in Stanley it is often good to pay with credit cards and USD.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on the remote islands, but British and American currency can be received; contact the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer when it is winter in the northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; in the summer months it is common with temperatures above +30°C
Winter can be fraudulent cold: the temperature rarely falls below zero, but the wind and humidity combine and makes it feel colder than the thermometer says.
"There are no special "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the rainfall remains about the same throughout the year."
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you must stay at least 100 metres from bears and wolves and 25 metres from all other wild animals!
No matter how fat they look, bisons, elks, canoes, bears, and almost all large animals can be attacked.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep an adequate distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Remember, too, that smells attracting bears and other wild animals, so avoid having with or cooking food that smells and keep the camp clean.
Samoa's capital is called Apia. The city is located on the island of Upulu and has a population just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of an infamous deadlock in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All ships were lowered, except for a British cruiser, almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the battle of independence organised by the Mau movement, a peaceful convention in the city led to the murder of the chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because of Auckland's location between two ports. The most popular beaches are divided into three areas.
North Shore's beaches ( North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and on most of the maori myrrh offers shade.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are located at the Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes well-visited family beaches with a good range of shops located on the beach.
"The main local beer is "Number one", which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better able to travel.
The local drinking water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you worry.
"For the Australians the idea of "flat white" coffee is unknown. A "short black" is "espresso", cappuccino has a pile of cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk."
The warm milk meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips are made to the reef all year round and damage due to any of these causes of the reef is rare.
Yet, take the authorities' advice, sound all signs and pay close attention to security warnings.
Kubmanets are found close to beaches and close to river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can sometimes also be found at other times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
The main habitat of the salt water crocodile lies in the river mouths north of Rockhampton, so they usually do not live in the sea.
Reservation in advance gives the traveler security and a guarantee that they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have contracts with special hotels, but it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, transfer to and from the airport, and even package tours that combine flights and hotels.
They can also reserve your booking for you if you need time to think about the offer or obtain additional documents needed for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, all changes and requests should go through the travel agency first, and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of visitors decide to camp on site, and most visitors see it as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close where things happen, you must come early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even if the music performances on the main stage have ended, parts of the festival can continue to play music until late in the night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, because walking through ice causes really terrible sounds for those affected most.
Cruises to St Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are excluded from the visa requirement (see the conditions).
Casinos usually do everything they can to make guests spend as much time and money as possible. There are often no windows or watches, and the exits are often difficult to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drink, and pleasure to keep guests in good courage and make them stay in the room.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. But drinking impairs the judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone required to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware that snow, ice and temperatures below the freezing point may occur.
On icey and snowy roads the friction is low and you cannot drive in the same way as in bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, there may be enough snow in a very short time for you to get caught.
The visibility may also be limited by snowfalls or snowstorms or by condensation or ice on the vehicle window.
On the other hand, ice and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the largest tourism industry in Africa and the highlight of many visitors.
The term safari in popular use refers to travel across the country to see the amazing African wild animals, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and with standard equipment it is possible to see them well.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes overshadowed and you see them better with binoculars.
"Going safari (also called "bush walk" and "hiking safari") consists of walking either a few hours or for several days."
Paralympics will take place between August 24 and September 5th 2021. Some events will be held in other places around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia that has hosted two summer OSs, as they hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the launch was announced, you can be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies due to the corona virus look different, but by the end of March most do not extend as far as July 2020, when the Olympic games would have begun.
Most tickets to events are expected to cost between 2500 and 130 000 yen, with a typical ticket price of around 7,000 yen.
The ironing of damp clothes can help them to dry. Many hotels have an iron and iron board that can be borrowed, even if it is not in the room.
If no iron is available, or if you do not want to wear broken socks, try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be vigilant and do not allow the fabric to become too hot (which may cause shrinking or, in extreme cases, sweating).
There are different sets of clean water, and some are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others it is required several minutes.
Filters can vary in efficiency, and if you are unsure you should consider buying your water in a closed bottle from an established company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Harmful animals can destroy food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, allergic reactions, spread poison or transmission of infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that may harm or kill people by violence, are usually not classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the possibility of buying goods without tax or other supplements in certain locations.
Travelers on the way to high-tax countries can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The line between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh road, which often goes through isolated woodland.
If you are not used to driving on highways, run with reason: steep slopes, narrow lanes and cross-curves are common.
Set speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 56-64 km/h (35-40 mph) - and follow up is even more important than otherwise.
Strangely enough, mobile coverage is much better here than along many other routes, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are really good, and in Bavaria they are quite powerful and varied, similar to those from the neighbor of the south, Austria.
Pastries with fruit are common, with apples baked in pastries all year round, and cherries and plums during the summer.
Many German pastries also have almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cookies often fit especially well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but powerful pastries, you can try what is known by region as Berliner, Pfankuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with either meat or vegetables.
