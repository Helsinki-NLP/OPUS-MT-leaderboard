Welsh members of the National Assembly are afraid not to be taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly were recently appalled by a proposal to change the names of members of the Welsh Parliament or of MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reaction came because of plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
Members of several political parties are concerned that they can be ridiculed.
A Labour member said his group is concerned about your "MWP rmar on Twp and Pwp"
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means foolish and "pwp" bezj.
A member of the Plaid Party said that the group is not naked and has proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative member said that his group has an ‘open mind’ when it comes to renaming, but added that MWP is not far from the word ‘muppet’.
In this context, the Welsh letter w does not differ from the English Yorkshire diect its pronunciation of the letter u.
The National Assembly's delegation, which is now writing bill to introduce the name exchange, said: "The final decision on which members of the National Assembly should be called will of course be up to the members themselves."
A Welsh official decision of 2017 gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the name proposals that showed great support for calling the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of members of the National Assembly, prefer the Walisian Parliament or WMP delegation, while the MWP elections received the most support during the public hearing.
The members of the National Assembly have certainly made other suggestions, but the struggle to become a single member has given the leader of the delegation, Elin Jones, the main work, to submit the bill for a couple of weeks.
Legislativeisation of the reforms contains other changes to the functioning of the delegation, including rules on disqualification of assembly members and the design of a committee system.
Members of the Assembly will be able to vote on what to name when they debate the bill.
Macedonians voices in the dissipation of changing the name of the country
The voters shall vote on Sunday to change the name of their country to the ‘Republic of North Macedonia’.
The people's dissipation was determined to resolve a conflict that has been taking place for many decades with the neighbouring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a claim on the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia's membership requests to the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the people's dissipation of the name change, said he's going to look away from the result.
The supporters of people's dissipation, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price for becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells in St Martin style while the church in Harlem, New York, stroves
"The old ones I've talked to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Adams.
‘Today none of the parts exist.’
He said he understands why the bars disappear.
“People socialise in other ways now,” he said.
"Bars are no longer in the neighborhood that people visit normally."
When it comes to the churches, he is concerned that the money from selling the owners will not last as long as the tenants believe, 'and before or since they are back where they started'.
He added that churchks can be replaced by share-rights filled with the kind of people who don't care to help the historical places of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of those who buy share properties in these buildings are white," he said. "and this is the day when all the churches are connected, because it is unlikely that these people who move into share values will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built of white socks before Harlem became a black town - Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin church a decade later.
The original white methodist convention moved out in the 1930s.
A black sok that had preached in the vicinity, moved into the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black sock rental by pastor John Howard Johnson, who also hired the boycott of the shops in 125th Street, a chief executive in Harlem, where the owners were opposed to sitting or promoting answered.
The building suffered great damage in a fire in 1939, but then Pastor Johnson's followers planned to build it up again, they also ordered a new clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Johnson Senior and successor of St Martin, was proud and called the bell game "the clocks of the poor."
The expert who played at the bell game in July calls it something different: "One cultural treasure" and "one historical instrument that cannot be replaced."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the first watch game in the world to be played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who forgave church to play on the larger watch game in Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merryweather said Sankt Martin couldn't find a substitute for him.
What's happened in St Martin in the last few months has become a complicated story about architects and construction workers, some of them added by the leaders of the church toys, and others of the episcopal bishop.
The Sakristy, which has been sunk and is composed of the leaders of the people of play, wrote to the bishop in July with concerns that the bishop “would ask the sacristy to pay,” although the Sacristy was not involved in the bishop’s addition of architects and construction workers.
Some of the members of the sok have complained about the lack of openness from the bispedeme.
13-year-old damage to hair during hummardhick in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday as he dived after hums in California on the day of the hummar season.
Attend her just before 7 a.m. near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented on KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends in about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard that the gut called for help. He paddled away to the gut with a group and pulled him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought only the gut was excited to have caught a lobster, before he realized that the gut shouted 'what bit me!
Something biting me!"
'Hiile collarbone was torn off,' said Hammel that he observed when he reached the gut.
"I wonder that everyone must get out of the water: there is a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
Guten was picked up by air ambulance and went to Rady's hospital for children in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
It's not sure what kind of hai it was as a undoing gute.
In a press conference, Captain Larry Giles said that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but that shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles suggested that the gut suffered serious injury to the upper body.
The authorities linked access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that more than 135 species of hai are present in the area, but most are not believed to be dangerous.
Storejeda Sainsbury's bets on beauty product
The British store chain Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenham's beauty product and offer storage services at the store.
As part of an investment in the UK's beauty market, worth £2.8 billion, and continuing to grow while fashion and interiors fall, Sainsbury's will test out their beauty products in 11 stores next year, and several shops if it becomes a success.
The investment in beauty product comes at a time when the shelves that poke to be filled with TVs, microwaves and interiors are now empty.
Sainbury's said they would double the number of beauty products to 3000 product and offer the brand Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
They should give labels L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand such as the Boots store.
The store also has to relaunch its own makeup series Boutique and do most products vegan, which will attract more young customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop must test the halls of his perfumes in two of the Sainsbury's shops.
Online and a switch towards buying small amounts of food every day from local small shops means that large shops need to find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, an administrating leader in Sainsbury's, has commented that shops will look more and more like store stores, while shops are trying to fight low-cost Aldi and Lidl stores with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's joined the Argo's interiors in hundreds of shops and introduced several Habitat stores, since they bought up both chains two years ago. Sainsbury's claims that this has increased the dining room and so defended the purchase.
The store Jeda's previous attempt to renew the beauty and pharmacy departments was not a success.
Sainsbury's collaboration with Boots early in the 21st century, but this was the end of when the parties did not become single about how to share the profits from the pharmacy in the shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold pharmacy Celesio, which had 281 pharmacy and owned pharmacy Lloyds, for £125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still has a role to play and should offer an extended luxury range of skin products, including marked La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented, "We've changed the beauty shelves will look and experience to improve the environment for our customers.
We've also added colleagues with special skills who are to be able to offer beauty testimonials.
Our brands are designed to suit all needs, while the attractive environment and the practical locations mean that we are now an attractive beauty destination that demands the old way of dealing."
Peter Jones 'pussing' after Holly Willoghby withdraws from agreement worth £11 million
The star from the Dragons Den TV program Peter Jones is "raised" after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an agreement with his lifestyle mark worth £11 million to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to promote interior and added deira Truly.
The couple's cooperation has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop mark.
The host from the program This Morning, 37, made news about Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the star from Dragons Den, Peter Jones, in the midst of the development of their new collaboration on a lifestyle brand to focus on their own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was "raised" when the golden Holly confessed during a strenuous meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of Jones's business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly's new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - mean that she no longer has time to cooperate in the interior and accommodating Lily.
The collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop mark and was supposed to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to make it known that she should not work with Truly, while Jones escaped the United Kingdom to calm down in one of his holiday homes.
A source said, "Truly was absolutely at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term plan for the future, and would last for many decades.
Her decision to withdraw has surprised everyone involved.
No one believed his own ears on Tuesday; Truly was so near the launch.
There is a storehouse in Marlow filled with goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the decision of this Morning host, which is one of the richest stars in the United Kingdom, can cost the company millions because of strong investments in the product, from cushions to candles to clothing and interiors, and can cause delays in launching.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, has our close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created the brand Truly along with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the Chairman of the Board in March.
Couple of holidays together and Jones owned 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall become a brand ambassador for M&S and shall replace Ant McPartlin, hosting the I'm A Celebrity programme for the ITV.
A source near Jones said last night "We don't comment on his business."
Fine conversations "and then we fall in love"
He told me about the criticism he was going to get from the media to make a comment that some people might experience as “residual” and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
I said Trump with his customs voice as "New News Talker".
"I have not given up on anything."
He commented that Kim was interested in a new meeting after his first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step towards the overthrow of the North Korea Nuclear Weapons Programme.
But negotiations on the nuclear weapon program have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the top diplomat from North Korea said Ri Yong Ho to the hostess of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not received a ‘equal response’ from the United States of America that is approaching North Korea's early downturn.
Instead, he added, continued the United States with sanctions to press North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing great between us and North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Million people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He added that his work to improve relations with Kim has brought positive results--the end of rocket testing, help to release hostages and the return of the leases to American soldiers.
He defended his unusual procedure when it involved relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidentic, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in, we had about 200 people standing right there," said Trump and pointing at the group that stood before him.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia destroy island and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign aid organisations were informed that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of people in Lombok had to flee, no one declared a state of national crisis, which is needed for international emergency assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they are very clear that they don't want international help, so it's a little challenging," said Sumbung.
While Redd Barna put together a team to travel to Palu, it is still not certain if added with foreign passports are allowed to work in the field.
Sutopo, the president of the National Crisis Agency in Indonesia, said that the authorities assess the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations are allowed to provide emergency assistance.
Although Indonesia is often exposed to earthquakes, it is not specifically pre-empted by natural forces.
In the Aceh area they have built shelters for tsunamis, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
Trass warnings against tsunamis in Palu, there was no alarm, which most likely led to several victims.
Traveling between the Indonesian islands is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was at berth in Lombok to treat those who were injured in the earthquake are now on their way to Palu, but it will use at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on the improvement of infrastructure in Indonesia during the presidential elections, and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railways.
But the lack of funding has made it difficult for the administration of President Joko, and next year it is a choice again.
President Joko is also under pressure when it involves sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have accepted his conservative threat.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands had to flee when Christians and Muslims fought in the streets and used mace, arrow, and bow, and other primitive weapons.

The Constitution of Parliament of Cromwell is the last victim of the 'rewrite of history'
The removal of the statue would be the karma of Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious objects in England that the Puritan followers did during the Civil War of the 1600s.
But the Cromwell League described Crick's proposal to remove the statue as "noise" and "one attempt to write about history."
John Goldsmith, the president of the Cromwell League, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues, that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace was going to be a goal.
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was wrongly ordered or by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be too much for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, for the century before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent representation of Cromwell is evidence of public entities in the 1800s, and is part of the history of a figure that many still think is worth celebrating."
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was in the 1800s, and is still today, seen on as a defender of Parliament against external press, and in his case it was of course against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or not is still a discussion theme in historical debate.
What's certain is that the conflict in the mid- 1600s has shaped the evolution of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual that we know represented one side of it apart.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worth to celebrate and remember."
Mordargris Attack and Kill Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in South West China, following local media reports.
The man, whose surname Yuan, was found dead, with cut heart rate and dung with blood, near a pig bee in the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prefers to give pigs vaccines on a guard on 30 May, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning he found his cousin dead, and discovered that the gate of one of the pig bites was open.
He said that in the pen there was a large male pig with blood around his mouth.
The autopsy showed that a 250 kilo of heavy pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
'Only to my cousin was bloody and corrupt,' said the cousin, whose name was Wu, to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera shows Yuan got to the market at 04:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him did not listen to Yuan or his cousin.
The market player told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to prevent him from attacking others, while the police gather evidence of the location.
Yuan's family is now negotiating compensation with the market leader.
Although it is rare, such attacks by pigs have occurred before.
In 2016, a pig went to take a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, and caused serious damage to the man.
Ten years ago, a 295 kilo of heavy pig held a Welsh farmer prisoner between himself and a tractor, until his wife scared the pig away.
After a farmer in Oregon became one of his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive by default, but that the taste of blood can trigger animals.
'You will only play.
They like to bite a little, they are curious... they won't hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them," he said.
Rests of Hurricane Rosa brings rain to the south-west of the United States
As predicted in the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker over the cool water along the northern coast of Mexico.
Still, Rosa will be coming up with puddle rain to the north of Mexico and to the south-west of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa had wind force up to 136 km/h and was a hurricane of category 1 until 05:00 in the east of the United States on Sunday, and Hurricane Center was 620 kilometres southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is going to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, there is a low pressure over the Pacific that moves eastwards towards the west coast of the United States. Rosa comes closer to the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical moisture northwards to the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will react with low pressure and cause thick rain in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 centimeters of rain can create dangerous flames and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will lead to rain between 5 and 7 centimeters per hour in some parts of the south-west United States, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of the south-west United States; especially in large parts of Arizona.
Dangerous flames may occur due to scattered terrain and tropical rain.
It is safe from walks in the desert on foot because of the danger of tropical rain.
The rain can make divides into flashing rivers and lightning and thunderstorms will bring strong wind and dust.
The coming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the coast of southern California.
Total precipitation rates of more than 1 centimeter are possible, which can create small flames and smooth roads.
This will be the first rain city for the season in the region.
Scattered tropical rain cities will start in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before rain increases late Monday and Tuesday.
The Four Corners region can wait a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October can witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic becomes colder, but tropical strokes will still be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central United States.
There's almost 20 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
The next few days later summer heat will try to build up and spread again.
The softness of central and east America is expected to experience a warm start in October, with 25 degrees and upwards from the southern part of the large plains to parts of the north-east of the United States.
New York City can reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term warning indicates that there are high impacts of above-average temperatures in the east of the US during the first half of October.
More than 20 million watch the Brett Kavanaugh increase
On Thursday, more than 20 million people saw on the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court and the woman who owed him sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different television channels.
At the same time, the political discussion of the case continued, with interruptions in the regular TV programs by various broadcasters to reveal the last news on Friday: an unanimity reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that during the next week the FBI will investigate the guilt.
Ford told the Supreme Court Committee that she is 100 percent confident that Kavanaugh felt her when he was drunk and tried to take off her claw at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, during a sensitive rise, that he is 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It's probable that more than 20.4 million people saw a right on Friday, following Nielsen.
The company came to this number by finding the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
Number was not clear from other channels that displayed the right, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen is also having trouble counting drivers who watch from the office.
To put this in perspective, there's a similar number of viewers looking at an American football final or Oscar distribution.
Fox News' hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the channel was also the one with most viewers during the day with 5.69 million viewers, said Nielsen.
ABC was in second place 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
People are still interested in the ring.
Flake was the focus of the drama on Friday.
After Flke, a moderate republican, declared that he was on Kavanaugh's side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while Protestants shouted after him on the way to a loud ring with a judge committee on Friday.
He stood and looked in the ground for several minutes while the Protestants chained at him on CNN live.
"I'm standing here just before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to our country?"
Some said to him, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office has spoken, and before he entered the elevator he said that he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
The Broadcasting Offices showed the ring on TV when the jury would vote for or against the nomination of Kavanaugh to complete Senate and further smoking.
But Flake said he could only do that if the FBI investigated the claims against Kavanaugh in the next week, which the Democrats have also asked for.
Flake was partly overtook to talk to his friend, the democrat and Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake took a decision.
Flake's determination turned out to have power, because it became clear that the Republicans could not vote for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May owes critics to "play politics" when it involves Brexit
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, owes the critics of her plans to leave the EU to 'play politics' with future policies for the United Kingdom without regard to national interests, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to attend the Conservative Party's conference on 29 September 2018.
Next to the May interview on the front of the Sunday Times, an interview with former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, who goes to the Chequers Plan for Brexit, says that the proposal for the United Kingdom and the EU to collect their fees is ‘whole absurd’.
Wayde Sims shooting in the United States: The police arrest the suspected Dyteon Simpson for Sims shooting
The police have arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), was killed.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for the deliberate killing, says police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
An official video shows the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.

The guarantee to Simpson was set at $350 000, reporting locala The Advocate.
The Coroner in the Aust-Baton Rouge published an early autopsy report on Friday that showed that the cause of death was a shot in the head that went into the neck.
The Baton Rouge police thank the state police in Louisiana their special forces, the state police their krimlab, the Southern University police and local citizens to help them find Simpson.
The Athletic Director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thank the local police for being “annoyed in the achievement of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 meter high basketball player is raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average he scora he 5.6 points with 2.6 relapses per game of the previous season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team is "smoothless" after Wayde was killed.
"This is something we're always afraid of," said Wade.
Vulcan asks out cheese over Mexico City
The wish from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The national crisis prevention centre asks Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after the activity increases in the crater and the centre registered 183 gas and cheese spills within 24 hours.
The center had observed several ravens and tremors.
Social media images show thin layers of cheese on cars in different neighbourhoods in Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, which lies 72 kilometres south of the capital, since an earthquake with a strength of 7.1 occurred in central Mexico in September 2017.
The Vulcan is known as Don Goyo and has been active since 1994.
Police are collapsing with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of self-esteem
Six Protestants were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesting protests of self-esteem with police forces, and thousands of other protesters protested against independence one year after the smoking of possible emancipation from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces as they threw eggs and powder lacquers that created dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
The police also used batons to prevent escalation.
For several hours, the separatists cried "Don't forget, don't forgive" while the Protestants against self-proclaiming shouts, "Long live Spain."
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were treated for small injuries after protests.
The atmosphere is still pressed in the region, and many people still want to have a year after the October 1st, which was called illegal by Madrid, but which became several of the separatists of Catalonia.
Most voters were too self-sustaining, but there was also a low selectivity among those who were against the self-and-booting.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent smoking and selected collisions occurred in the region.
Groups that were too self-sustaining were sleeping in the tent on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
The demonstration nevertheless went off the stack, but it was forced to take another path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protests with his wife, said that he no longer has the hope of independence in Catalonia.
'For the past year, we experienced one of our bestsellers.
I saw my parents crying with joy to be able to voice for self-esteem, but now we're stuck again," he said.
Although they won the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties who are too self-sustaining to hold power this year, while many of their tenants are in exile or arrest while waiting for the trial for their role in the organization of the people's voice and the subsequent Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic filming protests in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict was headed up by politicians on both sides.
"The excitement increases more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan lodgers who have been part of the current legal proceedings since last year, declared that he will be elected in the European Parliament next year.
‘As a candidate in the European elections, the best way to condemn the backdrop of democratic values and repression we have experienced from the Spanish state,’ he said.

A crossbow may have been used to shoot at the car.
Menga shots give Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston Sikras says
Upshot Livingston surprises Rangers and Steven Gerrard experience his others saying after 18 games that train for the Ibrox Club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shot turned out to make the difference while Gary Holt's side wailing with Hibernian in others.
Gerrard's side has no away victories in the Scottish Premiership league this season, and is going to play against Hearts, as they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has six wins in a row, and the main coach Holt has still not lost since he replaces Kenny Miles last month.
Livingston loses a chance against the away layer
Holt's team should have rented long before they scora, and created several problems for Rangers with the direct gig.
Scott Robinson broke through, but had low effort towards the goal, which meant that Alan Lithgow had to work hard after the meeting with Craig Hallkett's heading over the goal.
The home team was naked about letting Rangers play over them, knowing they could create trouble for the away team.
And that's how the determining goal became scora.
Rangers joined a freespark and Livingston created an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson went against Menga, who took a touch and scora from the middle of the crime field.
Before then Rangers dominated the ball, but saw that the defense of home was solid and the Emperor Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continued into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save a goal.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but was stopped by Rangers' Emperor Allan McGregor, and Lithgow flew far after the ball was returned from Livingston.
The passports were sent back and forth in the Livingston Penalty field, while two sentences--after Hallkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one by hand--were waved away.
Phenomenal From Livingston Analysis
BBC Scotland his Alasdair Lamont in Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal struggle and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Each player played great and still impresses on the curve upwards.
Their playing and playing styles have hardly changed since they returned to the top class, but much of the thanks for going to Holt for the way he has the shock made since he was trained.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hallkett was intense, and organized a defense at military level, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall all over the fight.
In contrast, Rangers were not motivated.
Yet they were not as good as they had been under Gerrard, but this time they were not good.
They didn't play well enough, and they cut up only the home half once, which should make Rangers realize that they're not reaching up anymore.
Erdogan gets mixed welcome in Cologne
The state leaders in Turkey and Germany smiled under blue sky when they met to eat breakfast on Saturday 29 September in Berlin.
It's the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany -- which is hoped will repair the relations between the two NATO countries.
The countries have our own uniqueness in terms of human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's role in the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a big new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police prevented a population of over 25 000 people from gathering ahead of the mosque because of 'security causes,' but many of Erdogan's supporters met to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan - many of the Kurdish - also met to condemn Erdogan's politics and the German state's determination to welcome him in the country.
The dual Protestants reflected in distinction between German Turks, who view Erdogan as a hero, and others, who view him as an autocrat.

Long Lartin Prison in England: Six guards injury in uprisings
Six prison guards have been injured in an insurrection in a high-security prison for men, according to the United Kingdom Prison Office.
The current disorder broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 local time on Sunday.
Tornado Special Forces are collected to calm down the uprising, involving eight prisoners in a secluded part of the prison.
The guards have been treated for small injuries in the breath.
One jailer said, " Special interest guards will calm down the current uprising in HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible will be reported to the police and may have to sit in prison anymore."
It has over 500 people in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the United Kingdom.
In June, the prison director was reported to be being treated for injuries, after a prisoner went to prison.
And last October, special forces had to come to prison to calm down a serious uprising, where prisoners threw billiards on the guards.
The Orkan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flaum (for drying areas)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but it's just such a weather phenomenon that is heading against Arizona early next week, in the rest of Hurricane Rosa's move south-west across the desert, creating fear of flame.
The National Weather Service has issued warnings against flames on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and south and east Nevada, south-east California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa's expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and can give rain already late Monday.
Phoenix twitra National Weather Service that only ‘ten tropical cyclones have had tropical storm or low pressure status within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that reached 60 kilometers within the Arizona limit.»
The last models from the National Hurricane Centre report between 5 and 10 centimetres of rain, with isolated quantities up to 15 centimetres in the Mogolon Rim region of Arizona.
It can be calculated between 2 and 5 centimeters in other south-west areas, including central parts of Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, with isolated totals up to 10 centimeters.
For areas beyond the risk of flame, Rosa is a good sign in the dry area.
Although flaum is a serious concern, this is likely to be a useful area in the south-west of the US that is exposed to drought.
According to drought monitors in the United States, extreme droughts in over 40 percent of Arizona, the second highest drying category, report weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is going to move over the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
With wind over 135 kilometers per hour, Rosa on Sunday morning is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving northwards at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm meets colder water in the Pacific and calms down.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storms, Monday afternoon or evening.
It's going to be a lot of math in parts of Mexico, which could increase the risk of flames.
‘Sets between 7 and 15 centimeters are expected from Baja California to Northwest Sonora, possibly up to 25 centimeters,’ reportedweather.com.
Rosa will drag north along Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the limit of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will move further up through Arizona and into the south-Utah Tuesday evening.
‘The greatest danger of pink or the rest of it is a lot of rain in Baja California, north-west Sonora, and the American south-west desert,’ said the National Hurricane Centre.
This is expected to create life-threatening flames in desert and mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton, England: Fire arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man are arrested, suspected of killing after a 16-year-old was found in Somerset, England.
The teenager’s guerrilla was found damaged in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 04:00 on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital, and his condition is stable.
One 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old man was arrested in the Radstock area, reports the Avon and Somerset police.
The police have encouraged people who may have mobile recordings of what happened to make contact.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'lugged' under the chorus of 'bad and angry' the democrats were against him
"A voice for the judges of Kavanaugh is a voice against the unmistakable and unmistakable tactics of the democrats," said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has suffered during how bad and angry the democrats were through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave testimony over Congress on Thursday, and refused in an emotional way for the indebteds of Christine Blasey Ford that he attacked her sexually several decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about her debts during the ring.
The president said on Saturday that "The American people saw how brilliant and brave" Kavanaugh was that day.
"Earth to the judges of Kavanaugh is a voice to one of the most skilled lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a lackless public service," he said to a number of successors in West Virginia.
The president also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he talked about how important it is for Republicans to vote in the inter-choice in the United States.
'Five weeks of one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't set, but I'm setting really," he said.
‘That's why I travel around to fight for good candidates.’
Trump argued that the democrats are out to "stand up and block."
The first important voice in the Senate about the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to happen last Friday, said a republican representative of CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia, speaking on killed increases
At least 384 people are killed, many of them taken by huge waves on the beaches, while a powerful earthquake and a tsunami frame the Indonesian island of Sulawesi reported authorities on Sunday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to take part in a festival on the beaches of the town of Palu on Friday when the waves, which were six meters high, struck the beaches at sunset, and took many people while they were destroying everything they came across.
The Tsunami came after an earthquake of 7.5.
'When the warning of the tsunami came yesterday, there were still people on the shores who didn't go right away and thus became the victims,' said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, President of the crisis relief agency in Indonesia GDPB, in Jakarta.
"As if the tsunami wasn't enough in itself, he pulled cars, wooden tribes, houses; he fell everything on land," said Nugroho, and added that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climb up into three to avoid the tsunami and survived that way.
Around 16700 people were evacuated to 24 cents in Palu.
Photos from the air published by the Emergency Bureau show many broken buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershave continued to hit the coastal town on Saturday.
The earthquakes could be found in the area around, which has a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Technology Testing and Testing Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy from the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the energy from the Hiroshima nuclear bomb during the Second World War.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, said the bureau.
Nugroho committed the damage as “wide” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the dead have been found during the remains of collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 people were injured and that 29 are still missing.
Nugroho said that the number of deaths and the size of the destruction can be larger along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
"We haven't heard anything from Donggala, communications are cut," said Nugroho.
“More than 300000 people live there,” said the Red Cross, and added their additions and volunteers on their way to the surrounding areas.
'This is already a tragedy, but it may get much worse,' said the Red Cross.
The crisis agency was criticised on Saturday not to inform that a tsunami had slowed down Palu, although the authorities said that waves came before the period that was announced.
An amateur video divided by social media shows a man on the top floor of a building crying out desperately to people down the streets to warn them against the coming wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hit the coast, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the video with the first one.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a power break and cut the communication around Palu, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate emergency assistance.
The military has started the process of sending cargo aircraft with emergency assistance from Jakarta and other cities, reporting authorities, but refugees still need food and have other basic needs.
The city airports were reopened to receive emergency assistance, but will continue to be connected until October.
It was planned that President Joko Widget would visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
They added in the World Vision from Donggala have come safely to the town of Palu, and have set up tents in the backyard of their office. On the way to the city passed the total destroyed area, Dosaba said.
"They told me they saw many broken houses," he said.
It's very bad.
While emergency assistance organisations start their efforts to help those who became involved in the tsunami, some complain that foreign emergency assistance workers with expertise in crisis management have been denied entry to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign aid organisations and their members cannot start work until Indonesia has declared that the area is a national crisis zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
‘There is a crisis at provincial level,’ said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
‘When the State says ‘OK, this is a national crisis,’ we can open up international emergency assistance, but they have not updated the status yet.’
It's evening again in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, and the friends and family of those who are still missing hope for a miracle, but know that such natural disasters don't end well.
On Saturday a little guy got scared from the sewer.
On Sunday a woman was afraid of the rest of a collapsed building, where she had played a prisoner beside the dying mother saying for two days.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, was training two of the missing paragliders from the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
One man called Mandai said that some of the prisoners in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As one with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have an emotional burden to bear," he said.
Gendon said that he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu paraglidars, who had taken part in the local beach festival, after he heard that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages only showed a gray hook, instead of two blue hooks.
"I think that means the messages didn't show up," he said.
Twenty-six steal $26 750 from Newport Minibank, Living, United States
On Friday thieves stole $26 750 from a worker in the company Brink's in what he was about to fill up a minibank in Newport, Livee, USA, following a press release from the police in Newport.
The worker had just emptied a minibank in the entertainment area and was about to deliver more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While the worker was busy, "Strike a man up behind the worker" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses observed several suspects while fleeing from the city, following the press release, but the police could not determine the number of people involved in the robbery.
If someone has information about who was involved, they should call the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rapper renames Ye
Kanye West rapper renames--to Ye.
He declared his name change on Twitter on Saturday, and he wrote, "The coat previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had Ye as a nickname for a while, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The change of name came just before he would appear on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to let go of his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande at the show after she cancelled because of "emotional reasons," said the programme host.
In addition to being a abbreviation of his current artist name, West previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe the word "ye" is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West earlier this year when he discussed the album title with the Big Boy radio host.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
The name has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye--to reflect the good we do, the bad we do, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects on who we are."
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred to name Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, working with West earlier, has also changed the style of writing to the name with and without a dash and upper case.
Future President of Mexico promises not to send military to civilians
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to send military forces against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use the military to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the military shot on peaceful demonstrators and killed about 300 people, at a time when left-oriented student movements spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly support to students and opening several free universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of access to education have led young people to join criminals.
The United States should double investment in artificial intelligence
Since China is more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investments in research on the subject, says the investor and user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after different parts of the U.S. government spoke about artificial intelligence, although the U.S. lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China introduced its plan last year, aiming to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A doubling of the budget for research on artificial intelligence would be a good start, as all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we're looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," said Lee.
A doubling of funding can double the chances that the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence is taking place in the United States, Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book «AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order» this month via the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is Managing Director (CEO) of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the largest artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with an artificial intelligence system that struck the highest ranking player of the game Othello, and later he worked as a leader in Microsoft Research and was president of Google in China.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions organised by the US state, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, asking how time the next competition should be, so that it can be involved and identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get support from the state, said Lee.
'It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's the big companies,' said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired excellent students from university to work with artificial intelligence over the past few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen the research on artificial intelligence.
"I thought that doctoral students prior to artificial intelligence should be given automatic privileges," he said.
The Government of China published its plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Association for Natural Science finances students at academic institutions, not unlike the American National Science Association and other state organisations' way of distributing money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Formerly this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a common centre of artificial intelligence, which is meant to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House declared the formation of a committee of artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The national scientific union invests more than $100 million a year in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, no one has worked on the drafts of national security and artificial intelligence in several months.
Macedonians are voices in the news of changing the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum whether they should change their names to the Republic of North Macedonia in order to resolve a several decades-old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, insists that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a claim on their territory, and has used veto to vote against membership of Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name exchange can undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he is not going to vote in the referendum, and a boycott has raised doubts as to how far the referendum is going to reach the least 50 percent of the population she needs to be valid.
The question in the People's Desisture Site is, ‘Are you for NATO and EU membership and alone in the agreement with Greece?’
Supporters for the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the name change is worth EU and NATO membership. Macedonia is one of the countries that achieved independence after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote for the future of this country, for the youth in Macedonia, so they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Oliver Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the voice is not binding according to the law, a sufficient number of Members of this House have said that they will follow the result of the voice to make her decide.
In order for the name to be changed, Parliament needs two-thirds of the resolution.
The Prime Electoral Committee reported that nothing unusual had happened before 13:00.
Only 16 percent had voiced, as opposed to 34 percent in previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 of all registered voters were voiced.
"I have voices for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an election in the capital city, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko's voice in Strumika in the People's Abundance in Macedonia for whether to change names and open to join NATO and the EU on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of people's dissidents over the parliament of Skopje, by setting up tents and chairs.
"We're for NATO and the EU, but we're not to change the name of our country," said Kavadarkov.
"We're a poor country, but we have value.
If they don't want us under the name of Macedonia, we can go to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev has stated that membership of NATO will attract investors to Macedonia, which has more than 20 percent unemployment.
"I believe that the majority will vote for the change, of your 80 percent of our citizens will be a member of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after having voted.
He said that a 'yes' result can be interpreted as a 'confirmation of our future'.
A meaningful measurement last Monday of Macedonia’s policy research institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters are going to take part in the world economy — something that is under the needed figure.
Another meaningful measurement of the Telma TV channel in Macedonia showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, the channel said 70 percent was going to say yes.
In order for people to be closed, at least 50 percent have to be voiced, plus one voice.
If people's polling is not closed, it could harm the policy of the left-wing government that took place in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton defense and scorar
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling Vraka Brighton defense, which led to the 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday in the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy, as he scora for 65 minutes.
The Argentine point received a passport on the midway at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran past three Brighton defense players and reached the open track.
Suddenly Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender, before he ran past several others on the edge of Brighton Penalty.
He got past a passport on the left and found Sterling.
The English point used its first kick in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used right feet to beat Brighton Emperor Mathew Ryan with a shot right at the right end of the goal.
'Aguero still wears his feet,' said the City Coach Pep Guardiola to reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scora when he did."
But it was Sterling who gave the sky blue the first advantage of the Premier League fight.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep inside the Brighton Territory.
He kicks the ball in a beautiful way along the left end of the path to Leroy Sane.
Sane was holding the ball while he was renting Sterling against the goal.
The sky blue point kicks the ball into target just before he slid out of the path.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group phase at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday in Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play spoiler against Rockies in American baseball
Nationals eliminated from playoff content did not have much reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has a high level of competitive instinct, and hopes to take “mounden” on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to “playoff” for Rockies, who leases with one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies won at least 5-2 against the National's Friday evening, but looks forward to locking the first division title.
"Even if we don't play for anything, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team that most likely plays at the highest level so far this year.
Who won't play with such relationships?'
It is still unclear who is going to start in Nationals on Sunday, but Scherzer may be going to pitch.
Scherzer, who, in that case, starts for 34th time, throw a "bulpen session" on Thursday and should pitch normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, who comes from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 "strikeouts" in 220 2/3-innings this season.
Trump collects choosers in West Virginia
The President, in an obscure way, referred to his first election for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while he talked about how important it was for the Republicans to vote in the inter-election in the United States.
"All we've done so far is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not setting, but I run around everywhere to fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible group of democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're convinced that they're definitely going to take back power, you see how bad they are, how uncomfortable they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "to oppose and block."
"And you can see it based on the past four days," he said, and called the democrats "sink and bad and nasty and dishonest."
He referred to Senator and Democrat Diane Feinstein, who made his audience bow.
‘ Do you think her answer?
Did you play documents?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm expecting--it was really bad body language--the worst body language I've seen."
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They're intolerant to those who say what they mean
When the Momentum activists in my local party were voiced to censor me, it was not surprising.
I'm the last one in a series of Labour-MPs who've been told I'm not welcome - just to tell you what I'm talking about.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way because she protested against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticised to be alone with Jeremy Corbyn.
In terms of the importance of operating responsible economics, national security, Europe, and other similar themes, such as Jeremy ironically, were disincentives to former tenants.
In the invitation for the meeting in Nottingham East Labour on Friday, we said, "We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
In the last eight years of my years as Labour MP, Friday's meeting has been just like that.
Unfortunately today's meeting was not like this, and the promise of 'snillas' politics has been long forgotten, if at all it was followed.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in Labour, and that each meaning is condemned by the tenants in the party.
This took place shortly after Jeremy became a party leader, when colleagues I intended to be politically united with me suddenly expecting me to change and to be alone in matters I would never have told myself - whether it was a matter of national security or the internal market in the EU.
When I talk to the public, it has nothing to say about what I say, I'm always talking about social media and people want me to go off while they criticise central politics and say that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who are sexually discriminatory and racistly directing themselves every day, who are still professional and do not leave.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time period is how normalized it has been to harass politicians.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should be more tolerant.
In reality, we are no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone. For every motion of censure and for every change in the rules of the party, the party becomes narrower and narrower.
I have received many advice in the last two years from people who have said I have to take it easy and not be so loud, so maybe people will "like me better."
But that's not why I chose to join politics.
When I joined Labour, when I was still on the ball 32 years ago, it was because I was angry at Thatcher and how the government failed the country. My classroom was falling apart, so I would have better public services for those who need them most -- whether it was like a municipal councillor or government minister.
I've never hidden my political purposes, nor in the previous choice.
No one in Nottingham East may have doubted what I stand for and which of the current tenants I am not alone with.
To those who voted for the proposal on Friday, I can only say that when the country attacks a Brexit who will harm private, local works and public services, I don't understand why people care to throw away energy to ask questions about my loyalty to the Labour Party.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr goes to the top in Scottish rugby
Two late 'tries' might change the result a little bit, but there's no doubt that Ayr would tend to win in this very entertaining Tennent's Premiery game today.
They are now at the top of the pallet as the only invincible layer made of ten totals.
It was their sovereign defence and ability to take chances that gave their home team and coach, Peter Murchie, a good reason to be naked.
"We've been examined in the last matches, and we're still invincible, so I must be naked," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said, "Ayr fortresses rose, they were nicer than us to take chances."
Grant Anderson had a "try" for 14 minutes, where Frazier Climo tried a "conversion," which put Ayr in front, but a yellow card from Scotland Captain Rory Hughes from Warriors allowed Melrose to gather, and Jason Baggot took a "unconverted tree."
Climo received a penalty just before the break, he scora and "converted" a "solo trudge" to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the other half well and Patrick Anderson's "try," which was "converted" by Baggot, reduced the slinging moon by five points.
There was a long break when Ruaridh Knott was seriously damaged and laid on the stretcher, and from the restart Ayr went forward through a "try" from Stafford McDowall, such as Climo "converted."
The working captain of Ayr, Blair MacPherson, got a yellow card, and again Melrose tried a ‘unconverted Bruce Colvine trudge,’ at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and then Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball from the criminal record, scora MacPherson a ‘try’.
Climo 'converted' again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's 'box kick' and sent Gregor Henry away from his home team's fifth 'try'.
The star from the Scottish series, Still Game, starts a new career in the restaurant industry
The Scottish Still Game Star, Ford Kieran, seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry, after it was discovered that he is director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays together with the party Greg Hemphil.
The duo has announced that the coming ninth season will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan plans the life after Craiglang.
In accordance with official lists, he is director of Afakmörn Limited.
The player will not comment on the case, but a source from the newspaper Scottish Sun has the hint that Kiernan wanted to involve himself in the "progressive restaurant industry" in Glasgow.
«Havet is ours»: Bolivia hope the court will open the water route to the Pacific
Sails patrols marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flag with ocean blue flags.
The marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazona self are held by the motto: "The sea is ours. We are right
and an obligation to return to it.’;»
In landlocked Bolivia, people can still remember a coastline the country lost to Chile, in a bloody conflict of resources in the 1800s.
These hopes may be stronger than in many decades while Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice to come on 1 October, after five years of consultation.
"Bolivia has driven, serenity, and is foresight, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the judgments of the International Court of Justice, hoping that the Court of Hague supports Bolivia's claim, and that, after decades of negotiation, Bolivia gives its own way to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatically born president of Bolivia - who struggled to be elected again next year - has good reason to hope for a positive result.
“We soon get returned to the Pacific,” he promised late August.
But some analysts don't believe the court will let Bolivia access the sea -- and that little would have changed even if they got access.
The Netherlands-based United Nations Court of Justice does not have the power to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia, and has pointed out that they will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
That the judgment of the Court of Justice comes only six months after the last negotiations, indicates that the case ‘was not complicated,’ said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
The last four years have far away from Bolivia's cause, they've done it the opposite.
‘The problem of sea access has been addressed by the current Bolivian administration,’ said Zárate.
Morales, with his fighting rhetoric, has killed what was that of Chile's goodwill, said Zárate.
Bolivia and Chile will at one time continue negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the issue after that.
The two countries do not have an exchange of ambassadors since 1962.
The former President, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision was unusually fast.
On Monday Bolivia will be given ‘an extraordinary opportunity to open new relationships with Chile’ and a chance to ‘put a line at 139 years of indifference and benefit both,’ he said.
Calzadilla also rejected the fact that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used this maritime issue to win voices.
‘Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific,’ he added.
"The judgment is a possibility to see what we need to do to forget the past."
North Korea says they won't dispose of nuclear weapons if they can't trust the United States
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says that his nation cannot be the first to dispose of, if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday in the UN General Assembly.
He encouraged the United States to follow up on the promises they gave during the Singapore meeting between the U.S. and North Korean rentals.
Turns out at a time when the U.S. Foreign Minister, Mike Pomepo, seems to want to restart his fast-locked nuclear weapons diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
Say the United States has a false hope that North Korea will be in subjection if the United States continues with sanctions and opposes any declaration by the end of the Korean war.
Washington fights to agree to any declaration by the end of the war, without Pyongyang removing first.
Both Kim and the American president, Donald Trump, will hold a new meeting.
But many are critical that Pyongyang is serious when it comes to decommissioning and that the country most likely sees its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompao plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows that massive headbands are the last fashion on the way to a handicrafted near you
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, you no longer need to search.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a number of large and special headgear in their SS19 collection.
Most unpractical hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creations right on the catwalk.
The most magnificent garment was a lavish, beige Valentino hat with a feathery-like, on the breast that covers the models' heads.
There were also other oversized additions during the fashion show, including a jeweled vassmelon, a wizard hat, and even an pineapple--but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a collision with bizarre masks -- just in time before Halloween.
Many of the colorful worms had lips that were sewn together and resembled more on Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations resembles diver equipment, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looked like a melted ice in biscuits.
If you like this enormously dramatic fashion, you can only rejoice.
The fashion experts know that the huge hats are coming to the hall in a handicraft near you.
The oversized hats come right after the "La Bomba", the straw hat with the 60 cm wide belt that has been seen on celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult-mark behind the highest unpractical hat, which was everywhere on the social media, has now sent a new creation out on the catwalk - a straw strand bag of the same size as the bikini-clad model that carried her.
Strandveska, with the colour of burnt orange and frowns the top with a white skin handle, was the most iauquemus's most iaugly part of the La Riviera SS19 collection under fashionka in Paris.
Luke Armitage's acquaintance Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the fashion shops next summer - the designer has made such a big impression that I doubt that it is possible to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Global citizens need language skills
Private schools in Scotland are known to be at a high academic level, and this continued in 2018 with excellent examination results, which is only enhanced by individual and joint success in sport, art, music and other societal measures.
With over 30,000 rivers across Scotland, these shells, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Scissors, are working to provide their students and parents with the best services.
The aim of independent skular is to prepare their students for further and higher education, career paths and the role of global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made syllabus, we see that modern languages are popular choice in the spheres.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, the message goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we can't only get into English when we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries.
By looking at the results of the exam this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest standing characters for the self-slashes.
A total of 68 percent of the rivers that took the French language got A.
The data collected from the SCIS's 74 member balls show that 72 percent of the students received A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who took German, 69 percent of those who took French, and 63 percent of those who took Spanish also received A.
This shows that independent skular in Scotland supports fromman languages as vital features, which children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Languages such as optional courses are considered equivalent to the STEM courses (science, technology, engineering studies and mathematics) in the curriculum of self-stupes and other places.
A survey carried out by the British Adding and Properties Selection in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of employers looked to fill the settings due to lack of language skills in the applicants.
For this reason, language is increasingly important in order to prepare young people for working life.
With more work skills for language professionals, these properties are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever kind of career a youth chooses, if they have learned a second language, they have a proper advantage in the future with such a property.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically benefit a multilingual person in a competitive world.
Following a YouGov survey of more than 4000 awake British in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any other language than English well enough to hold a conversation enigma, and French was the only language spoken by a twofold percentage, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language training for our children.
The ability of multiple languages, especially those used in developing countries, can give children a better chance of finding good jobs in the future.
In Scotland the language in which they teach is different.
Many shrieks focus on the classic modern languages, while others teach in languages that are classified as important in the United Kingdom when we look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a lot of languages in which to choose from one another in the self-touches, and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scotch self-esteem skular is dedicated and wants to create a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the properties they need to close, regardless of what future breasts they need.
One cannot deny that in this global business-oriented environment, languages are vital for the future of the country, so this needs to be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be referred to as ‘international communication properties’.
The choice will continue to be made, thus providing a high level of skill for Scotland’s young people.
Il faut been le faire.

LeBron debuts in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Ventetida is soon facing fans who are happy to see LeBron James debuters at Los Angeles Lakers basketball.
The Lakers Coach Luke Walton has announced that James is going to play in the presong game on Sunday, against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how long he's going to play, has not been determined yet.
"There will be more than one minute and less than 49," Walton announced on Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, twitter that James is most likely to play for a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' schedule for the first season.
"I don't need a presong game at this stage of career to get ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump starts on a whirlwind of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of Trump's five scheduled stops the coming week, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmatory vote pending for the election of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming mid-way elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when votes are due in November.
How time should Trump be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you see it on the web?
Trump's collection in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00. this evening, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see the Trump's West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably take up this week's voice of the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh, who was excited about guiltys of sexual abuse, with an expected confirmatory vote from the Senate waiting for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the primary goal of this cave of collections is to help Republicans meet November elections and get some momentum (power).
So President Trump's campaign says that these five collections in the next week are aimed at 'promoting volunteers and adherents who Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the Representative House', according to Reuters.
‘Control of Congress is so critical of his agenda that the President will build as many states as possible as possible when we enter the busy campaign,’ states a spokesperson for the Trump campaign who refused to be informed of Reuters.
Planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the collection can bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and pull cover from Pittsburgh media", following West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisy, who's been asked for in the meaning measurements.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisy that the president has to come and try to give him a lift in his polls," said Simon Hader, a political scientist at West Virginia University, following Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows the stomach for struggle to keep hope alive on singles on Sunday
After three unilateral sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes could only be like this Ryder Cup trong.
The swinging portion of the moment is a completely inflated sports round, but one that players really believe in, and never more than on competitions like these.
So where would they say that the momentum is now?
'They had a six-point rental, and now there's four, so we take it as a little moment, I guess,' said Jordan Spieth as he spas off for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points leading to twelve more in games.
The Americans, as Spieth says, know that they have a little wind in their sails, and they have a lot to empathize with, not least shaped to Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and every one has three points from four.
Spieth has our mortals from tea to green and is looking for judges.
The guttural screams of the celebration were higher when his round continued, and sought an important pot to take the match four all-squao.re when he and Thomas had been two down after two.
His boy who won the battle of 15 was met with a similar scream, the kind that tells you that he means that the American team isn't out of this.
'You've actually only got to dig deep and worry about your own fight,' said Spieh.
There are all of these players left now.
18 holes to create an emblem.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the invincible story of Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but sweet couple are four from four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who would not shoot a bowy on Saturday afternoon, but they also missed the bowys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine (the last nine holes on a path with 18 holes) on Friday morning.
That race, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this noisy, engaging audience, states that they are the players to fight on Sunday, and there would not be more popular players to seal a potential European saying when the sun goes down over Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Ideally both at the same time on different holes.
Thank you for your European honour being too soon.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did short work by Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
An archey and two doubles on the first nine, the rough span and the Swedish into a hole they never came close to climbing out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to look closely at because of the interaction between opponents, the advice they give, and the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better as a layer so far and takes a significant rental into the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team United States has the stomach for the fight that someone, especially Stateside, had doubted.
Europe takes 10-6 rentals in Ryder Cup Final
Europe will have a healthy advantage into the last day of Ryder Cup after coming out from the four-balls of Saturday and foursome games with a 10-6 lead across the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari hired the charge with two victories over a fighting Tiger Woods to take his fight so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European page asked to keep the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a mistented American page tomorrow fourballs, and took the series 3-1.
USA expected more resistance in foursomes and won two matches, but they couldn't get in the underscore.
Jim Furyk's page needs eight points from the 12 single-matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European robe that wins four points in a row while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after an observational weekend, are only the second couple that wins four points from their open in four matches in the Ryder Cup story.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they made themselves so great as to beat off an exorbitant Woods and American rooke Bryson Dechambeau with an even more wanted 5 and 4.
Woods, who snuck through two matches on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who slept for the morning fourballs, returned to the parties Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 and 1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Even Europe didn't get everything they wanted in a nice, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three times big Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas win the reference to the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a brave 2 & 1 says over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and came back later to beat the Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursomes because they had lost the two holes in the open.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history has a layer come back from a four-point base and entered single, even if as a holder, Furyk's side only needs to draw to keep the trophy.
After being the second best for two days, it still looks like a Sunday counterattack will be outside of them.
North Korea says you can't rust one-sided without confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations Saturday that if sanctions continue, the distrust of the United States will grow, and that in no way would it give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho stated in the annual General Assembly of the World Government that North Korea had done "material measures" to improve the situation in the last year, for example, they have stopped nuclear and missile tests, disassembled the nuclear test site and did not promise to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We still get no equivalent back from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri, a well-known North Korean, has made several complaints about Washington's resistance to a "fascism" approach to the disposal of nuclear weapons, where North Korea would be paid to take gradual steps, his questionings showed significant in that he did not reject unilateral nuclear destruction, as Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to a common phrase written by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit ever between a sitting American president and a North Korean rental in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work for the “building of nuclear power on the Korean peninsula” while the Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has requested a formal end to the Korean War since 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted talks to facilitate tough international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States insists on the "destruction of nuclear power first" and increases the pressure of sanctions in order to achieve its objective of coercion, and they even oppose the "declaration of peace", said Ri.
‘The belief that sanctions may break us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that when the sanctions go on, our mistrust is only getting bigger."
There is nothing about the plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president has highlighted in the United Nations last week.
Instead, the Minister weighed three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, in the last five months and added: "Shows the party in this uprising to the destruction of nuclear weapons was South Korea, and not the United States, the reconstruction of the Korean peninsula would not have stopped as it has now done"
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the General Assembly in F.N. that it was not possible to stop North Korean rockets against the mainland of America, after the evil president Trump calling Kim a rocketman on suicide.
Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, augmented praise over Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work still had to be done and that penalties had to remain in place for North Korea to eliminate its nuclear weapon.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a timeframe for this, and said, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that F.N. Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the actions that have been done.
But the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told F.N.'s Security Council on Thursday that "The sanctions to the Security Council still need to be sustained vigorously and without failure until we get the complete, final, verified liquidation of the nuclear weapons."
The Board of Insurance has consistently increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to choke the means of Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline of the general meeting in F.N. and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year already, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that it had been made progress, but a few hours later he condemns North Korea to come with 'gangster-like demands'.
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile city and also a nuclear complex if the United States did ‘equal action’.
He said that Kim had told him that the ‘equal measures’ he applied for were guarantees of insurance that Trump promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalizing the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take the course of getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University has this year helped all the students to get more sleep, trying to fight the growing macho culture of study in caffeine all night, meaning that one uses caffeine to stay awake all night to study.
An academic found out that college students often lack sight when it comes to the most basic thing - how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developing the course, which he believes is the first of his battle in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deficiency on learning.
"At the end of the day a girl came up to me and said, "Why am I told this now, at the age of up?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping--what surprises me, he said to The Telegraph.
The course, roll out for the first time this year, explains what is important to how good sleep habits help academic and athleteic performance, and improve their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of University Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after the students had seriously worse sleep during the week.
The hourly course contains a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dormitory, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaching and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athleteic performance is affected by sleep shortages, as well as how important it is with evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deficiency may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, asks participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know it won't change the behaviour of rivers at once.
But we think they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know, the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes, la Prof.
The culture of pride over the clocks still exists, he said and added that modern technology and ever increasing pressure on students mean that sleep shortages are a growing problem.
To ensure that you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said--even by avoiding going up in weight, since sleep shortages put the brain in starvation mode and making them constantly cool.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after having been a student to his previous year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eye and inspired him to press to get a course for the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all PhD students to complete a similar study program before starting at the prestigious institution.
Prof. Czeisler advised that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, and besides for when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light coming from electronic monitors and LED lighting, which can completely convert the inner clock, leading to problems of sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga Goals Give Gerrards Men Down
Rangers went for a new defeat on the road when Dolly Menga's post sent Steven Gerrard's missing page to a 1-0 loss on Livingston.
The Ibrox site was looking to take its first say on the road since the 4-1-triumfen on St Johnstone in February, but made for Gary Holt's cause only Gerrard's second defeat on 18 battles as a leader, and gave eight points, one round under Ladbrokes' leader of the Premier League, Hearts.
The amount of time went to seven minutes before half-time, and a Ranger statement with a lack of inspiration never seemed to look like.
While Rangers no fell down to the sixth place, Livingston climbs to the third and lies only behind the Hibernian in goal separation.
And there may be additional problems in stock for Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a wound in the head, after an object appeared to be thrown away from the outside.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, however, went with Livy 11 who took a point with a dream shot last week, and he would have been excited about the way that it was well-drinking his lap roof on his opponents at every shift.
Rangers might have had the ball most, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scora after just two minutes when Menga's first post sent Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midwayer failed in his struggle.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs found so captain Craig Hallkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot far on the retread.
Rangers took control, but it seemed to be more hope than believe in their game in the last third round.
Alfredo Morellos knew that he would have to have a penalty of 20 meters when he and Steven Lawless collapsed, but Steven Thomson condemns the desire of the Colombian.
Rangers could only two shots on target in the first half, but the former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly was hardly concerned by the Lassana Coolibary's headar and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi says open for the 34th minute maybe it might have been against the rules of the game, no one can deny that they would tell it only because of the word "shit".
Again, Rangers failed to handle a deep death ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher struck the ball of Scott Robinson, who kept cool to pick out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard put in the break as if he exchanged Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and replaced the cause of an immediate effect when the wing player created a hatch for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rose forward to block.
But Livingstone continues to overlay the guest team to play exactly what game they liked, with Lithgow and Halket sending forward long shot in long shot.
Holt's team could have increased his rent at the end, but McGregor succeeded well in preventing Jacobs in it, until Lithgrow made a long post from the cornermark.
The reserve for Ranger, Glenn Middleton, had a new demand for punishment when he supported with Jacobs, but again Thomson overlooked it.
Almanac: Inventor of the geigere printer
And now one page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and we RECOGNIS... the day that he was to become a physicist John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Using a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the apparatus known as the Geiger counter.
As a scientific supporter all along then, the Geiger counter was also a supporter in pop culture, as in the 1950 'Bells of Coronado' film with the seemingly unlikely late cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What in all the world is it?
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of atoms that result from the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Yes, no boble it!"
‘Hans’ Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the invention that asks his name lives on.

Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize red cells, as part of the treatment

A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, felt that the ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from one patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein commonly used in many cancers called HER2 and then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘driven the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer,’ explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extract immune cells from patients and ‘learning’ the way they target cancer cells has worked when treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West starts a Pro-Trump Diatribe, wearing a MAGA-lue, after he guests the TV show Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was the pioneer in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an incredible achievement in which he praised the United States president Donald Trump, and said he would stand for election in 2020.
After taking his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he wore on a Make America Great-caps, he gave the democrats a thither and repeated the support of the Trump.
"How many times do I talk to a white person, and they say, "How could you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a number together with the composer Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fools of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate court of the guilty of sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not sent, the recording to West's thiade was uploaded to social media by Chris Rock's commissioner.
It's unclear whether Rock was trying to mock West with the post.
The West had also complained to the audience that he had the difficult backstage because of his headband.
‘Dei bully me behind the stage.
They said: Don't go out there with that hat on.
They bully me!
And then they say I'm in a sunken place," he said, following Washington Examinor.
West continued: "Do you want to see the reduced place?" says he would "take on the superman cap, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try love.’
His comments led to a beep at least twice from the audience, and the SNL Cast Members seemed embarrassingly concerned, reported Varies, with a person who said to the publication: "Heile studio was dead."
West was brought in as a late substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, when her former girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died some days ago.
West confused many with a performance of song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who twittra: "To one of the most brave spirits: TAKE TO CALL THE PUPEL."
But talkshow-hostess Karen Hunter twittra that West ‘may simply just be what he is and it's absolutely amazing.’
"But I chose NOT to pay someone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his 'art') who I believe embraces and asks out ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We're also going to add it.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now ‘formally known as Kanye West’.
He's not the first artist who changes his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Medrappar, Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and of course the last musicalist Prince, changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington goes against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is familiar with the hovering role of Jon Snow in HBO's mighty medieval fantasi series Game of Thrones.
But the coder, 31, has gone against the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen often lead young guys to feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes that something has gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-author Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he knows ‘very strong’ to take up the problem.
"Personally, I'm convinced that something has gone wrong with masculineity." he said.
"What have we taught men when they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit means that TV is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to very human characters.
He goes on to say, 'What's innate and what's the lesson being taught?'
What is taught on television and in the streets, what makes young guys feel that they must be this peculiar side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change that?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.'
In the interview he also realized that he would not do the Game of Thrones sequencer or follower at the end of the series this summer, saying he is "completed with battlefields and horses".
From November Kit will play in a new recording by Sam Shepards True West, who is the history of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The player recently revealed that he looks at the meeting with his wife Rose to be the best that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this show, so it gave me my future family and my life forward," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the pronoun of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are framed in the country, saying health care providers.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new occurrences were transferred through six, and marked a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the amount of people who got HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health professionals said at a conference in the Yunnan province.
However, from years to years, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 10,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/HBTQ individuals is claimed to be widespread.
Because of the conservative values in the country, students have spoken that 70-90% of men having sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an attempt to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters nectared to add leak of information from the GOP-senator, it explodes in 'Dangerous Lies' and 'conspiracy Theorys'.
The U.S. Rep. Maxine Waers condemned on Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican U.S. Senators on the Wikipedia pages to the legislators.
Los Angeles The Democrat claimed that the claims were pedaled by extreme-right searches and web pages.
«Liegers, liars and more contemptible liars», said Waters in a twitter phrase.
The published information included information about home addresses and telephone numbers for the Americans Sens. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing about the guiltys of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came once after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh a question.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the articles was linked to the Waters office and published the information to a member of the Waters staff, reported Hill.
‘This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie,’ continues Waters.
"One of my added--who has got its identity, personal information and security compromised as a result of these unscriptural and false claims-- was by no means responsible for the leakage of this information.
This baseless allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Questions to Water quickly received criticism on the Internet, including from the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," said Fleischer.
‘This suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is owed something they didn't do, they don't have to be angry.
They must not be tough.
They must not ask questions about the motives of the debtor.
They must be quiet and peaceful."
Fleischer turned out to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the judges of Kavanaugh, who was owed by critics to be seemingly angry during the louding on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to take over Water's place in the middle choice, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Large if it's true," he twitted.
In fact, Waters said that her office had warned 'the right government and the law enforcement units of these false claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are revealed," continues it, "and that they will be legally accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous for each of my employees."
Johnny English beats again - espionage of weak Rowan Atkinson
It's traditional to look for Brexit skills in all new movies with a British wink, and it's active for this resuscitation of Johnny England's action comedy spoof-franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was relived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-ironic satires who negotiate how openbert we are become the new export power in the country?
In any case, the great, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber cover has for the second time been given a new right to fuck things up--his name signals more than anything else that he is a wide business for cinematists in non-English-speaking countries.
Of course, he's the stupid, secret agent who broke in his bizarres wants to spread a little glamour has got a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes a simple tune to the Firecars, theme under the Olympic opening Monia of London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the building and international mysterious man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, which left chaos in the after.
There are one or two fine eye contactes in this last JE excursion.
I love Johnny English who approaches a helicopter while he was dressed in a piece of armor from the Middle Ages while the rotor blades strike against his helmet.
The gift of Atkinson to physical comedy is on the screen, but humor feels rather fragile and strangely redundant, especially since ‘sereous’ movie brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible even now safely offer comedy as an ingredient.
The grandmother feels like he's looking at children instead of awake, and to me Johnny England's noisy accident isn't as inventive and focused as Atkinson's replicatic clothing in the person of Bean.
The permanent current situation is now that the United Kingdom is seriously troublesome.
A cyber-hackar has infiltrated the United Kingdom's super-secreted web network of spies, which uncovers the identities of all agents of the United Kingdom in the field, to the dismay of the agent at work - a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and warlord figure, who already has a complete breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does his very best with this quasi-Thesesa-May character, but there's not much in the script to work on.
Her intelligence counselors inform her that once every active spy has been in debt, she must collect someone who has been retired.
And that means that the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works as a teacher at something elegant establishment, gives unofficial lessons on how to work undercover: a couple of fine jokes here, since English offers a School of Rock-type Academy for spying.
English is sent back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reforeina with his former understanding assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moving over to a submarine job, a superstitious role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little bit lost.
So Batman and Robin's ability to get things to become terrible crazy in Hennar Majesty's Secret Services is back too full in the meeting with Olga Kuryleneko's beautiful five fatal, Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the prime minister fell dangerously under the charismic technology of the billionaire spell, which claims that he can solve the United Kingdom's computer problem: the scary Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start to build their own farce-like game: disguised as waiters, put them on a fine French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggle themselves on board Volta's yacht; and English triggers pure anarchy as he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All stops are probably slowed out to the last sequence, but as lovable and outsiplined as it is, there's quite a lot of children's TV all over the place.
Pretty moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't help thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes justice to his talent?
Labour Party Labour denies that they are working on a plan for the English to work for a four-day week, but are paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party now assesses a radical plan that wants the British to work a four-day week - but gets paid for five.
According to the report, the party will pass on savings made by artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers, by giving them an extra day off.
Then would add a three-day weekend--but still get the same salary.
Sources said the idea would 'fit' with the economic agenda of the party and plan to increase the benefits for workers.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changed economy.
An older source from Labour told The Sunday Times: A policy message has been expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It doesn't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a desire that fits into the approach the party has to balance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as to the party's industrial strategy.'
The working party would not be the first to accept such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week in its election campaign in 2017.
However, the ambition is not accepted by the entire Labour Party at the moment.
A Labour party spokesperson said: 'Ei four-day work week is not party policy and the party is not assessed.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's work conference to enhance his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to take back power from “faceless directors” and “professors” in rich businesses.
Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current vassate shareholders cannot regain their full effort as a Labour Government could do a 'disorder' because of perceived misbehaviour.
He has also verified plans to set up employees in corporate boards and to create the Inclusive Ownship Fund (including ownership funds) to provide 10% of equity in private sector enterprises with added capital, which would receive annual dividends of up to £500, about $5,000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, tells the '60 Minutes' TV program about the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could get them to change their tanks.
The FBI investigation of complaints against judges Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to Supreme Court for at least a week, and it raises the question of what extent found to the Agency could affect some Republican Senators to draw their support.
In an interview sent Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could uncover anything that would cause them to change their mind.
Kennedy seems more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
'I mean, of course,' said Kennedy.
"I said on my way into the ring, I said, I spoke to the judges of Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, the statement came out and said, 'Have you done it?'
He was well-whelmed, well-whelmed, unwitting."
Graham's voice seemed still seen in stone.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynasty-complaint to change me," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it vigorously, "l'll let Graham go and refer to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all her names couldn't confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changed.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday is the New York host of the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a hugely impressive set of stars acting and an equally impressive mission; end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to the Central Park's big lawn, not only to enjoy seeing Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes acting, but also to increase the awareness of the true goal of the event of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concerters had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" as a voluntary job; send email to a host, call a phone call or other meaningful means to help increase awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But what success has Global Citizen been with 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of paying people with a free concert a real way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called "pressivism" - people feel that they make a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says that it has registered more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, and participated in and pressed on a variety of goals.
It says that these actions have contributed to the announcement of commitments and policies by hosts that correspond to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group showed 390 commitments and announcements resulting from their actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the financial midlanes to date have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important obligations are The Power of Nutrition, a British-based partnership of investors and performers who are obliged to "help children reach their full potential"; promise to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from global citizens.
‘With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history,’ – told the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking more than 5,000 actions to require the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the UK government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition treatment.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, they ask, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen said, "It will be a long and difficult way--some times we will fall and fail.
But as the great civil rights and the anti-Apartheid pipes lead us, we're going to loop, because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the actors who appear at the New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Flag as a 'block' to prevent Russian energy exports - Internal Secretary
Washington can ‘if necessary’ for its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, has international secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where they are operating on the invitation of the legitimate government - is an incentive to explore new energy markets.
‘I think the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to communicate energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe,’ he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to tackle it.
‘The United States has this euro, with our fleet, to make sure that the mariners are open and, if necessary, block to ensure that their energy does not go on the market,’ he said.
Zinc spoke to participants on the event organised by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that presents itself as ‘the voice of the energy consumer’ in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, and he noted that they are actually the same.
‘The economic solution in Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuel,’ he said, while referring to Russia as a ‘one-trick pony’ with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations come as the Trump administration has been commissioned to increase the export of liquid natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this connection, officials of the Trump administration, including President Trump of the United States, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the ‘inappropriate’ Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump made Berlin the ‘capture’ of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly underlined that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipe leasing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's keen opposition to the project is only driven for economic reasons, and is a judge of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American holding has withdrawn from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s industry leasing organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
‘Eg has a major problem when a third state disrupts our energy supply,’ said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "run hard" to make Presidential candidate in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would take a "good look" to make a presidential candidate after the middle election.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider a candidate to be a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our poor government, and it includes a woman at the top," she said following The Hill.
‘After 6 November, I will consider the issue to be a presidential candidate.’
Warren took part in President Donald Trump at the council meeting and said that he ‘is driving this country in the wrong direction’.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren has our crash in his criticism of his Trump and his Supreme Court Chosen Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a meaningful measurement published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's own voters do not think that it should be a candidate in 2020.
51 percent of the 'probable' Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not be a candidate, following the Suffolk University Political Research Centre/ Boston Globe investigation.
Thirty-two percent supported such a candidacy.
The investigation showed more support for a round of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other highly profiled democratic names discussed in terms of potential 2020 candidation, include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin's PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) at Donald Trump collection
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being served in September.
He was arrested and charged with an election event in the home on Monday evening
"What my own son goes through, what he goes through when he comes back, makes me be able to relate to other families that are marked by PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers return with," she said to the audience at a collection for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the Elephant in Space" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little different, they come back shepherd, they come back and wonder about the respect for what they and co-suns and flightrs and all the other military, have done for the country, exist".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was guilty of physical violence in the home against a woman, for disturbing a report of power in the home and the custody of a weapon while he was rushing, following Dan Bennett, the spokesman of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 countries, D.C. support challenge to new asylum policies
Eighteen states and districts in Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new American policy that denies asylum to victims as refugees from popular or elected in the world.
Representatives from the 18 states and districts submitted a friend-of-law short of Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker as a foreign policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace v. Sessions is suitable for the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Freedom Union) archived in August against federal policy not being revealed.
She said that her partner "and the chosen relic sons" abused her, but American officials refused her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers to the State, who support Grace, describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of American asylum seekers, who are facing radical problems with gangs and power in the world.
The new US asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision from immigration laws, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing from the world to seek asylum.
The District of Columbia Minister of Justice Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy ‘ignores many decades of state, federal and international law’.
‘Feederal law requires all asylum cases to be condemned for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an obstacle to this principle,’ said the friend-of-the-right card.
Lawyers further stated in their summary that policy that denies access harms the economy of the United States, and that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and ‘providing the necessary work’.
Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration magistrates to no longer grant asylum to victims who were fleeing abuses and gangs in June.
‘Asyl is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,’ said Sessions in June 11 in its announcement of policy.
Asyl was never meant to alleviate all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day all over the world.
Disorientated rescue work in Palu while the death-count doblast in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation became increasingly serious.
'It feels very excited,' said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who put his fever-sick baby son at an evacuation center in the broken city, Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances come with bodies.
Clean water is hard to find."
Inhabitants have been observed on their way back to their broken homes, looking through watered possessions and trying to scare everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals that were destroyed by the earthquake, which had a strength of 7.5, were crowded.
Some of them injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken his back and shoulder, were sleeping outside Palu's Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors because of still strong backwoods.
Tears filled his eye while he pretended that he knew the powerful earthquake shaking the hotel room he shared with the wife's and the daughter in the fifth floor.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I believe, 'pronounced Haris to Associated Press, and added that his family was in the city for a wedding.
'I heard my wife shouted for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador owes China for ‘mobbing’ with ‘propaganda ads’
One week after an official Chinese newspaper conducted a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper and highlighting the mutual benefits of trade with the United States and China, the American ambassador owed to China Beijing to use the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's paid for in the Des Moines register - the state of Iowa's largest salsavis - after having owed China to try to interfere in the US Congress elections on 6 November, a debtor China denies for.
Trump's indictment that Beijing was trying to get involved in American choices, marked which American officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an increasing trade war that has seen them in turn increase taxes on each other's imports.
China's back-to-back charges early in the trade war were designed to match exporters in countries like Iowa who supported the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and US experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the American ambassador to China and the former long-standing governor of Iowa, a great exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and companies.
“China”, wrote Branstad in a sentence in the Sunday Des Moines register, “double no bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
‘In its distribution of propaganda, the Chinese Government uses the American dear tradition of freedom of expression and a free press by entering a paid advertisement in the Des Moines register,’ wrote Branstad.
‘In contrast, by the aviscioske down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited divergent voices and will see no true reflection of the various measures that the Chinese people may have on China’s problematic economic path, given that the media is below the solid thumb of the Chinese Communist Party ‘strike him.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish" his article, even though he didn't say what a newspaper.
Republicans demand female electors leading the midterm with Kavanaugh Debacle, warning analysts.
As many top Republicans are stand-by and defend the Supreme Court-elected Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple claims of sexual abuse, the analyst has warned that they will see a setback, especially from women, in the upcoming midway elections.
The facts about this have our extremely high, and most Republicans are on record that they already wanted to move on with one voice.
These things cannot be undone, says Grant Reeher, professor of State Science at Syracuse Universitys Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last eye contact for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angrier.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow, and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisors and national spokespersons for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday. Washington, DC-Avisa.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang "November will come!" while they protested in the hall of the Senate when the Republicans, who are in charge of the Court Committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination to the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be outside the diagram," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partial political analyst, to the news page.
"People say it already has our high, it's true.
But it can be higher, special among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds, who, while they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which stated in detail the claims of sexual abuse against the name of the Supreme Court, the analysts suggested that a relapse could follow if the Republicans pushed forward with the confirmation.
“This has been a confused root of GOP,” said Michael Steele, former leader of the Republican National Committee, early in the previous week, according to NBC News.
‘It’s not just about the opinion of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is seen on the bench, it’s also about how Republicans have handled it and how they have treated it,’ Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to select Democrats, point to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be a little bit split over who they should trust in the keel of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little bit more siding with the latter.
A new meaning measurement from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied under his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI investigates the claims made by Ford for the time being, and then at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testifies to the Justice Power Committee of the Senate during his last week that Kavanaugh completely assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court-nominated showed her sexual organs while they attended a party during the time they studied at Yale University in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Planner to start a new Internet meeting Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project for technology end users, Inrupt, is a company built by Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to select where data is stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee spewed that the instrument with Inrupt is “world domination”.
"We must do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's an historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online repository or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-dos, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access all kinds of information.
The company calls it ‘personal authority through data’.
The idea to Inrupt, according to the managing director of the company John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, process and suitable capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a insurance platform purchased by IBM and some dedicated developers with a contract to work on the project, as well as a community of voluntary encoders.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using tools available on the Intraupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about not introducing a complete change where all their business models are completely turned around on their heads overnight.
"We do not ask for their permissions."
In an article published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network collection built on Solid.

Bernard Water: WW1 Victoria Cross Divine Feira
The only church of England that won a Victoria Cross during the first world war as a fighter has become farthest in its hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Pastor Bernard won the prize on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was still killed by a carpenter four days later and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial was turned off by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Water, said that it was "brillant symbolic", that the stone would be turned off just 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning performance.
According to London Gazette Lt Col Vann rented his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918, ‘through a very thick shot and under heavy fire from fields and machine guns.’
He later ran up to the front line, and with the 'maximum gallantry' he led the line forward before he eleine rushed forward with a field gun and struck out three of the group.
Lt Col Water was killed by a German shooter on October 4, 1918 -- a little over a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said that the actions to his grandfather were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I'm humbled for."
He and his brother Dr. James Water also laid a crane after the parade, which was followed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said that he knew a great deal about playing a role in the parade, and added that "the value of a real hero is shown by the support given by many people."
The MMA fan was up all night to see Bellator 206, they got Pepper Gris instead.
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see a Bellator 206 package and you can't see the main event.
The San Jose report contained 13 matches, including six on the main card and was displayed live through night in Great Britain on channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just in the Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald planning to meet each other, drivers in the United Kingdom were again stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Gris.
Some were a little impressed after they had kept awake until the early hours especially for the fight.
A tab on Twitter criminal switch to the comic book of the children as ‘a sort of sick joke’.
"It's public regulation that at 6 o'clock if the inside wasn't owned like this, they had to switch to the program for the children," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president for marketing and communication, when he was asked for the transfer.
‘ Peppa piglets, ‘yes’.
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they're going to work on planning to include British viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about replay, I think we might be able to figure it out," said Coker.
"But the clock is six in the morning on a Sunday, and we can't figure this out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it went over, there were many texts that went back and forth, and everyone wasn't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, the next time it's not going to happen.
We keep it to five games instead of six -- which we usually do -- and we tried to survive to the fans, and we just went over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley knew "the wonder" because of sexuality
The Olympic stepper Tom Daley says that he in the uprising felt worse than all because of his sexuality--but he gave the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went to the forward slide that "not everyone is like me."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island disks presented by Lauren Laverene, he said that he spoke about his gay rights to give the second “hop”.
He also said to be a parent made that he cares less about winning the Olympics.
The regular reporter in the long-range show, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off because of illness.
What could look like a lost in the Laver's first program, Daly said he knew "less than" all the others who grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to equal the guys and girls."
He said, "To this day, the feeling of feeling less than and feeling different is the real things that have given me the power and strength to throw away."
He wanted to prove that he was "whato," he said, so that he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-gonger bronze Olympic medal winner has been a professional LGBT campaign and used its appearance on the Commonwealth Games of the year in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke out because he knew luck that could live up without any confusion and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-turn world champion said that falling in love with a man--the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013--"Cover me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he, last year, but he said that the difference in age never had been a problem.
"When you go through so much in such a young age" -- he went to his first Olympics 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and downwards.
The couple were parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Dalley, and Daley said that his whole "his" perspective had changed.
"If you'd asked me last year, it's all about whether I need to win a gold medal," he said.
«You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Mi Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about was whether they had tickets for London in 2012 - when he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be in the front row," he said.
"I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead which I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the Olympics in 2012 and water bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had been dreaming of my whole life--to dive in front of a home republic at an Olympic game, where fans no better sense," he said.
It also inspired his first song election -- chaired by Heather Small -- which had vibrated with him in the structure of the Olympics and gave him still goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape his Mikkelson on the bench on Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mikkelson wants to set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47. Ryder Cup match, but he has to turn the shape around to avoid it being an unfortunate milestone.
Mikkelson, who played in the two-year event for a record 12th time, was seen on the bench of Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes golf game.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five times big winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working with his game within the reach of the hope of correcting what he says.
Never the most competent long shot. Not even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is the best way to hit the long shot on the magic French main track, where balls hit outside if the golfer is not exactly with the battle.
And if the path itself isn't frightening enough, Mikkelson meets in the ninth battle Sunday, the precise British Open Master Francesco Molinari, who has joined with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their fightings this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 single matches, comes to a warm start, the game of Mickelson can be completely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on his back and put his arm around me and said that he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has great confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer, and he has added so much to these layers in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he played two matches.
I saw for myself more, but that's how it was, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He will be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson wants to beat Nick Fallo's record in most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career which has never completely matched the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven halves, even though Furyk said that his proximity brought some intangible features to the team.
“He’s amusing, he’s sarcastic, entertaining, likes to keep fun with people and he’s a nice guy to have in the teamroom,” he explained.
"I think the younger players had the fun that got together with him too, this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than just playing."
Europe Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that big rental can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European Captain, knows from experience that a significant rental on the way into the last days singles of Ryder Cup can easily be converted into an unpleasant trip.
The Danish debut in the 1997 campaign at Valderrama, where a side captain of Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came across the mark with the nose leading with the smallest margins, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You continued to remind yourself that we had a big rental at Valderrama; we had a big rental at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only so far,” said Bjorn, after he had seen the Class 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to rent 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this isn't over.
You're going to the full opening tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you score the board.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus is going to stay.
I've said all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're so well aware of what's on the other side -- the biggest players in the world."
Rejoice over how his players have performed on a tough golf course, let Bjorn: "I would never take the say in advance.
Tomorrow's another day.
Tomorrow, it's the individual performances that come out, and there's another thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there individually, you'll be tested out of your capacity as a golfer.
That is the message you need to communicate to players; get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he must go and get the best out of himself too."
In contrast to Bear, unlike Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to perform better individually than they did as parties, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who score three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been at both ends of the spin operations in the last few days, after being part of the winning team in Brookline before he ends up losing as Europe drew from the "Miracle of Medinah."
"I think every fucking word of it," he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999 had gathered his players on their way into the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to get started with the fast start that you saw on Brookline, as you saw on Medinah.
When the moment moves one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle battles.
We put up our line-up correspondingly and put on the gutter in a way that feels good, you know, we're trying to do something magical tomorrow'.
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to hire the game and meets Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I joined this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way through," said Bjorn about his choice of singles.
Germany's new warship once again appointed
The latest frigate to the German Navy should have been ordered in 2014 to replace elderly warships from the cold time of war, but it will not be there until at least next year due to the incorrect system and dirty costs, reported local media.
The launch of Rhineland-Palatinate, the leadership of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigattane, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 following Die Zeit-advisa, which quotes a military spokesperson.
The ship should have joined the fleet in 2014, but the worrying problems after the delivery of the plage fate to the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships the Navy ordered back in 2007 come as a substitute for the elderly Bremen class frigatets.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful cannon, a series of anti-planes and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as radar reduction, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frugats for up to two years away from ports at home.
Nevertheless, continuous delay means that the groundbreaking warships, which apparently allow Germany to exercise foreign power, will already be out-dated when they enter service, note Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 Ferry made headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
It was little known about the causes of the return, but the German media quoted a number of important "software and hardware failures" that made the warship useless if they were placed on a battle mission.
Software flaws were particularly important as the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a crew of around 120 sailors -- only half of the labour force of older Bremen-Fregates.
It also turned out that the ship is dramaticly overweight, which reduces performance and limits any fleet to adding future upgrades.
The 7000-tonnes ‘Rheinland-Palatinate’ is assumed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the wrong hardware, also the price of the entire project - including training the crew - becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached fainting €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - from the beginning €2.2 billion (EURO)
Problems associated with the latest frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany’s fleet power is decreasing.
Formerly this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the German Parliament's Defence Selection, acknowledged that the fleet actually ‘has almost ended the distribution competence of ships’.
The officer said that the problem has been built on over time, because old ships were closed, but no replacement vessel was delivered.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigatts were able to join the fleet.
National Trust thief listens on secret life for bats
New research carried out on a property in the Highlands of Scotland aims to reveal how the bats use the landscape in hunting for food.
It is hoped that find will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and contribute to correcting future conservation activities.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow regular and soprano piperelles and then brown long ears and Daubenton bats at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be located in important locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS added and volunteers will also conduct mobile searches using handheld detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bats and the nature of what they do.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape scale image of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a natural scientist for the NTS, hopes that the results will cover the region of natural habitat, natural worlds, which is most important for the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management as the purchase of meadows and how it is best to maintain equal forest areas of bats and other associated species.
Flagmuse populations in Scotland and over the United Kingdom have significantly decreased in the last century.
They are threatened with construction and development that affects resting places and loss of habitat/causing sites.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose risks, such as fly paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, and also attacks of pet cats.
bats are not even blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are still more useful than their eye when it comes to catching prey animals.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to find faults and obstacles in their display.
NTS, who is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes the bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct examinations, rest inspections and sometimes save lives.
The organisation has even created Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve on Threeave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bats.
Real estate administrator David Thompson says that ownership is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Treave we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many vets and all the good habitats.
But there's a lot about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other possessions will help us understand what they need to be happy."
He emphasizes the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance within ownership, since it is possible that the infinite destruction of a single bus stop can kill up to 400 female bats and young people, and perhaps deform a whole local population.
The bats are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, plow or interfere with them or destroy their resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the audience to come in and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are dangerous."
Ronaldo rejects the claim in the lawyer's action against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has marked the sovereign debt against them as ‘false news’ and says that people ‘want to highlight themselves’ by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been responsible for the election of an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is claimed to have paid her $375.000 to keep quiet about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, to its 142 million, only follows hours after the debt, that the debt is ‘false news’.
‘No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news, five times the Goldball winner goes into the camera.
‘You want to market yourself by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be familiar with my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and all right, "let the player smile and smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are about to sue Der Spiegel over the claims, which they have called ‘an inconvenient reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy’, according to Reuters
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for “moral damage in an amount that is to the seriousness of the rulebreak, which is probably one of the most serious personal violations in recent years.”
The alleged event is said to have found a city in June 2009 at a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the room of the player, where a claim that he should have elected her anal, following the document submitted by Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the suspected event and stated that he was a '99 percent' good light and failed with a 'one percent'.
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her photograph taken of her injuries in a hospital, but was later agreed on a settlement because she felt "feared by retribution" and was concerned about "becoming a public alms."
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to change the bus because she is continuing to be traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was on the brink of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve in a 100 million deal.
Brexit: UK would forever undo losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would undo it forever if it lost its status as a hostess before car production after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "about" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the United Kingdom left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of border delays in case a non-contractual Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150,000 cars last year, where 90% had been exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU at the end of March, we see a stop in production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have raised fear of leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says for example that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford in a month after Brexit.
The main concerns about what car manufacturers say are the risks of supply chains in the event of a non-contractual agreement Brexit.
Toyota's production line is driven on a ‘just-in-time’ basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the United Kingdom and the EU for cars ordered.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, disruptions may occur at the limits that the industry sees as leading to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's values of furniture at his Derbyshire factory, said the company, and thus the production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's Checker's plan for future relations with the EU is ‘net calibrated to avoid controls at the limit’.
"We need to have an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow, as I say, not only to enjoy the success today, but for us to seize this possibility, "he told the BBC Radio 4 Day Programme.
“Provide from not only Toyota, but other producers are that we must be able to carry on what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term they warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnston for 24 years, and is the Unite Union Association at the plant, said that his members are more concerned about: "After my experience, when these jobs go, they never come back.
One official of the government said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Nestleiaradvokat Rod Rosenstein could be "press back a week" as the fight against Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the white house Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Council Robert Mueller, who examines Russian whale mix, connections between Trump helpers and Russia, and potential obstacle to justice by the President.
Whether Trump wants to tell the general of the sagvokats or not, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, has fed Washington gossip for months.
Earlier in the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed a rental to register talks with Trump and the possibility to remove the president using the 25th change.
Rosenstein refused the report.
But last Monday he went to the white house, and it was reported that he was about to go up.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he wanted to "pretty" not to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was appointed to avoid crashing with the Senate Commission's louding where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who has addressed him for sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, witness.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed full vote from the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "There has been no date set.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the pressure up to date."
Some reporters may say nothing about it: Sanders has not held a press briefing for the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of orientations was not because of a dissatisfaction with the TV reporters' game for the gallery, although she said, "I'm not disliked that they do it."
It mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president holds more press conferences than any president has done before," said she - right enough without proving the claim. "We've looked at numbers."
Sanders says updates are still going to happen, but "if pressure gets the chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do it this way, and you've seen us do it often in the last few weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press briefing if you can talk directly to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions as he travels from the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It's unusual for the president to hold the press conference aleine.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, in which he committed the reporters without shame, and almost bizarrely.
Health Secretary writes about Brexit-fryt to workers from the EU at NHS in Scotland
The Health Secretary has written to workers from the EU who work at NHS in Scotland to express thanks and a desire for them to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter even if it is less than six months before the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to taking on the costs of applications that have the status of EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: ‘During the summer, negotiations have continued between the United Kingdom and the EU, and it is approaching the expected conclusion of the harvest.
Nevertheless, the British Government has stepped up preparations in case there is no agreement.
I understand that this must be a difficult time for all of you.
So now I want to repeat the price I have seen on the contributions to everyone added, regardless of their nationality.
EU colleagues, and beyond, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work in the health sector and are beneficial to patients and communities.
Scotland is a very clear dive home, and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after head injury
The linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays on Tennessee State Tigers, went through an acute operation after attracting a head injury when the team lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports the newspaper The Tennessee.
The main coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the damage happened just before the break.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed, in a way," said Reed.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they placed him on a stretcher and took him back for further evaluation.
An official spokesman from Tennessee State told WSMV that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt medical centre.
There's no detail about the magnitude of the damage yet, said Harris, and added that Tennessee State is still trying to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie goes second year at the university, and is in his first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before he got hurt in Saturday's fight, and is now up to 18 total this season.
Foreign purchasers have to pay a higher document fee when purchasing property in the United Kingdom
Foreign purchasers have to pay a higher document fee when purchasing property in the United Kingdom. The extra income is to be used to help the homeless, following the new plans to the conservatives
Decision-making will neutralise Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in the document fee will be added for those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Statskasse expects an increase of up to 120 million pounds a year - to help the homeless
Theresa May today announces that foreign buyers have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in the United Kingdom.
This decision will be considered as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn in attracting young voters who tend much, with the promise of offering reasonable housing.
The increase in the document fee will be added for individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the extra money will strengthen the government's desire to reduce the number of ombudsmen.
The fee, which is in addition to the current document fee, includes the higher levels introduced two years ago at the bus number two and rental dwelling, can be as much as three percent.
The central government agency expects the decision to receive up to £120 million a year.
About 13 per cent of new buildings in London are purchased by residents outside the United Kingdom. This increases prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to enter the residential market.
Many well-standing areas in the country - especially in the capital city - have become ‘smooth cities’ because of the large number of foreign buyers that most of the time hold up in other countries.
This new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson wanted to cut the document fee to help more young people buy their first world.
He charged a large construction company to keep the prices up by getting hold of property but doesn't use it, and asked Theresa May to give up the allowances at the rhyme housing houses to fix the United Kingdom's housing chamber.
Corbyn has announced a series of iauctional suggestions for residential reforms, including controlled rentals and the termination of out-of-ground screenings.
He wants and advise greater power to build new homes.
May said, "I said last year that I wanted to dedicate my post to bringing back the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
That means fixing the broken housing market.
The United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be right for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, or a foreign company, to buy dwellings that are too hard-working, British inhabitants.
For many people, the dream of the owner has come to be far away, and the humiliation of being around is real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "ultimate ambition" is to become manager of Scotland at some point.
The shoot (42) rejoices over the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer, after leading St. Mirren back to the Scottish elite series in the previous season.
"I wanted to play for my country playing.
I got a B-land fight, and it was,' Ross said to Scotland's BBC Sportsound.
"But I wake up watching Scotland on Hamden as well as my father, and there's always been something that has pulled me back.
That possibility can only come if I have success as a club manager."
Ross' predecessors like Sunderland Manager include Dick Advocaat, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he hasn't been anxious to come for so many established names in such a large club, since he has previously rejected the approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
'To the moment, success to me will be measured if I can 'get this club back in the Premier League.'
Based on the structure and the facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they belong to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get them there, but I can probably just look at myself as successful if I manage to get the club back there."
Ross is only three years into career as manager, after a period as assistant manager of Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the coaching of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to get from the dredging to the third level, and transformed St. Mirren, who was about to descend, into the title winner of the championship series of the following season.
And Ross says that he feels more comfortable now, than he ever did while he was playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a crossroads," he says of leading Alloa.
"I thought that being a manager would fit me much better than being a player.
It sounds bizarre, because I did well, I thought well and I liked it relatively well.
But gigs can be tough.
There's a lot of things you need to get through every week.
I still notice it when it comes to stress and pressure with the job, but it feels right to be a manager.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I am. It's the most comfortable thing I've felt in my own body in my whole beautiful life."

Examination shows that the perfect time for a pint is 17.30 a.m. on a Saturday
The heat wave of the summer has led to an increase in the intake of the street pubs in the United Kingdom, but it has increased the pressure on the restaurant chains.
In July, the hall increased by 2.7 per cent in the bar industry, but for the restaurant industry, it went down by 4.8 per cent, the statistics show.
The business advisor Peter Martin, who is behind the statistics, said: "The sun at present, and the fact that England was in the World Cup longer than planned, means that July followed the pattern for June when pubs went up 2.8 percent, only that restaurants became even harder frame.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in the restaurant industry was only worse in July.
Pubars and bars that sell drinks made it significantly better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubar that sells food, got and noticed the decline in the sun, although it wasn't as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It can seem like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars the drinking room had increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food had gone down three percent.
Paul Newman, an analyst for travel and leisure at the RSM, said: "These results are the continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather, and the impact of a huge social or sports event, will still be the biggest factors when it comes to the halls of the outdoor industry.
There is no surprise that the restaurant industry will still wear.
The long, warm summer couldn't come at a worse time for food-driven operators. The time will show if the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can give a prolonged breathing space."
The total salsauving across pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the descent in the release of branded goods.

One in five children has secretive social media profiles they hide from parents
One of five children - some as young as 11 - has hideous social media profiles that they hide from parents and teachers, showing an investigation
Examination of 20,000 students on further reports an increase in false Insta profiles
This news has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students say they have a head profile they show parents
One out of five children -- some as young as 11 -- create profiles on social media that they keep to themselves.
An investigation among 20,000 rivers on the next slide revealed a strong increase in false Insta profiles - a reference to the Instagram image-sharing platform.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they have a sterile head profile they refer to parents, while at the same time they have private profiles.
A mother who stumbled over the secret page of a 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who called on others to "elect me".
The research, made by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistress' Conference (HMC), found that 40 percent of those between 11 and 18 years had two profiles, and half of these prisoners had to have private users.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said, "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create places on the web where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilith Doyle will be the ‘vote of athletes’ of the Scottish Board of Rights
Eilith Doyle has been elected as a non-administrative director at the annual general meeting of the Management Board for the Scottish Right.
Doyle is the most decorated sportsman in Scotland, and Chairman Ian Beattie describes the event as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to take advantage of her extensive experience at international level during the last decade.
‘Eilidh has a great deal of respect across Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world's civil society, and we are sure that the right of freedom in Scotland can benefit from its entry into the board’, said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as a voice for the perpetrators, and I hope I can help and help the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has gold from both 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996, among their total four OL gold and now is a regular guest of the BBC, was unable to go after a drip.
On Twitter he wrote: "Today it is one month since I was struck.
I could not go.
The doctors said that it was only time that I could tell myself if I was going to be good again, or to what degree.
It's been our exhausting work, but I've been really good again, learned to go again, and today I'm making flexibility!
Thanks for the encouraging messages!'
Split devices on the Internet about breast pump advertising that compare mothers with dairy cows
A breast pump company has a split opinion on the Internet with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to dairy cows.
To mark what is described as ‘the first silent, insidious breast pump’, the technology company Elvie released a small-faced advertising inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom the new pump gives mothers who extract milk.
Four real mothers dance in a tall-filled box of cows, to a song that includes text like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you see no tails" and "In case you don't mark it, these are not tensions, these are my poppies."
The reference goes on to say, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed these children, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies".
The advertisement, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has, however, created controversy on the web.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, and many say it highlights the “scatter” in the dairy industry.
‘Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and feed to produce milk, only that the calves are stolen from the only days after birth," says one.
The Elvie breast pump has its discretely contained in a breast bra (Elvie/More)
Another comment was, ‘I understandably traumatic for both mother and child
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another said, "For a rational advertising."
Others defended the advertisement, and a lady admitted that she seemed to be "festivable."
‘I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have one if I still breast-feed.
Pumping made me feel a net like a cow.
This advertisement is a little crazy, but I took him for what he is.
This is a brilliant product, wrote one.
Another commented: ‘This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers like pumps (often at work or in the toilet) and feels like cows.
This is not an advertisement that boasts or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they've all danced with the discrete pump wrapped in their bra's.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women like pumps say they feel like cows.
On the other hand, the Elvie pump is still, has no rents or pipes, and its discreetly inside a sucker bra, which gives women the freedom to move, keep their kids, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: "Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product, that it ignites a wavel and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers who extract milk and dairy cows, we want to put search lights on breast pumping and the challenges associated with it, and at the same time demonstrate the incredible freedom of the new pump will bring, in a entertaining and recognizable way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
In London's moteuka, one mother to two appeared on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski, while she used the product.
Hundreds of immigrants move in silence to tentleir on the limit of Texas
The number of immigrants in prison has peaked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the strict policy implemented by the Trump administration makes it more difficult to place children at sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors have our undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that standing up and receiving a child might threaten their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk of increasing in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other beautiful family members are forced to submit fingerprints, and that these data will be shared with immigration funds.
Last week, Matthew Albence, from the immigration and Customs Department, testified to Congress and said that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to be sponsors of single minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had nothing to do with their scroll leaf.
«More than 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of these are criminal foreigners.
So we're going to continue to pursue these people," said Albance.
As added to the camp, new rules have now been introduced to deal with children. The rules require some of them to be in court before a month has passed, compared to a previous 60 days.
Many people want to participate via video calls and not at personal meetings, in order to get their case tried to lead an immigration sentence.
Those who are not qualified for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely it is that they are developing anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent eruptions or runaways, they say they are added to the clay. Reports that have appeared in the last few months say the same thing.
spokesmen say that these concerns are greater at large installations like Tornillo. Because of the size of the facility, it is more likely that one overlooks the signs that children wear.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare themselves emotionally, or say hating to friends, can intensify trauma with which many already struggle.
Syria asks the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked for Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country is now at war in the eighth year.
Moualem, who and act as Deputy Minister of State, said that prominent forces remain illegal on Syrian soil under the pretext of defeating terrorism, and "will be treated out of it".
"They must withdraw immediately and without delay," he said to the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that ‘the war against terrorism is almost over’ in Syria, how more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to “fight a holy struggle until all Syrian territories have become reinsa” for both terrorist groups and “unlawful presence of aliens.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and consulting both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the warlord country.
When it was talking about the refugee problems, Moualem said it was safe for them to come back, and he blamed on "some Western countries" to have "prived irrational fear" about the surroundings that caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and the humanitarian organisations to facilitate return," he said.
"You are making politics out of something that would be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria before a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to ending the war is in place.
United Nations diplomats say that a recently established agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major uprising, has created a possibility to continue pressing forward with political talks.
The Russian-German agreement destabilises a major attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stresses that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against jihadistar, including the warriors of the Nusra Front, who are linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be wiped out."
The UN broadcast, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon gather the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition member to draw up a post-war law for Syria, and pave the way to the elections.
Moualem sets the conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the Committee and states that the work of the panel should be limited "to review the articles of the current constitution" and to warn against disruptions.
Why Trump will win another semester
With that logic, Trump will win the 2020 re-election if not, as many liberal viewers probably hope, the presidency will end early because of scandals and national law.
It would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!"
At the time of writing, there is no sign that the viewers have passed away.
Since 2014, CNN doubles its rating at best to 1.05 million, whereas MSNBC almost triples to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million drivers in peak broadcasting time, from 1.7 million four years ago, following Nielsen. MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show has a game at the top of the cable rating with as much as 3.5 million viewers in evenings with great news.
"This is a fire that people are shut off, because there's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer in the ABC drama "Designed Survivor", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress Building.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy author and author of the 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club', has a different theory.
She's thinking of a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he would vote on Trump.
Why?
'Because he makes me laugh,' he replied following Scovell.
There's a entertaining value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the story that comes from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families get to be together again and heal to the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged drivers can afford.
And yet it goes further beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself in the sixth hour to see a panel of experts debating Bob Woodward's use of sources with "deep background" for the book "Fear," Paul Manafor's bomber jacket of ostrich to $15,000 ("one garment thick of arrogant", said Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniel's ominous description of Trump's, eh, anatomy.
Personally, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Parts of what he does that get it to be felt like a reality program, is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, daily leader of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and created by ‘Pawn Stars’, about the show going with Trump's employees and daily disputes (go into a fight with NFL, rose Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode, otherwise you're no longer hanging with it.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was more than 25 degrees and sun outside his world on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat in and looked at MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He did not manage to turn away, not when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Commission and the future to the Supreme Court hung in a thin thread.
‘I think as we did all these crazy shows before in time and people said ‘This is the beginning of the end of the Western civilization’, said Fleiss.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Externally, money flows into the densest middle-selecting mouse button
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th district sees an abundance of money, thanks to a conversion of the districts of Congress that led to two sitting members fighting for the same seat.
It recently surrounded the suburbs of Pittsburg to bring forward Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district through a special election in the spring of last year.
Lamb fights against another seated member, Republican Keith Rothfus, today representative of the previous 12th district of Pennsylvania, who largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
A map was redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania concluded in January that the old districts were illegal in order to benefit the Republicans.
The competition for the 17th district has launched an arms withdrawal for the funding of the campaigns, between the large parties their money arsenal, the Democratic Congress Select and the Republican Congress Select.
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a button says in a closely followed special choice in Pennsylvania's 18th Congress district.
The seat had been listening to a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by over 20 points.
Political experts have given the democrats a scarce advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador due to support for China, but withdrew
Diplomatics note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without any negative reaction from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until parties throw out the Trump organization's leader group.
The state secretaries decided to bring back the U.S. leaders for diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "last decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the Prime Minister, in a decree early this month.
However, punishment was only assessed against El Salvador, which receives an estimated 140 million dollars in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and financial support.
The preliminary sentences, containing cuts in financial support and targeted restrictions for visas, would have been painful for the Central American country and their high unemployment rates and murders.
As internal meetings develop, North American and Central American officials held a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year that was considered a step forward to prevent immigrants from arriving in the United States.
But in mid-September the top administrators informed that they wanted the conference to continue, and put a stop to the evaluation of the punishment for El Salvador.
It has now been said that Vice President Mike Pence is going to meet the conference, which has been planned in the middle of October, as a signal of the relevance of administration to the collection, said the diplomats.
And the three American broadcasts returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new pompous messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson for Bolton would not comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by an extraordinarily understanding analyst working closely with the administration and speaking in the context of anonymity.
Study history
One awaits special adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice, for which there is now considerable evidence in the public records.
In line with the reports, Mueller should have turned focus on the investigation against the Trump campaign conspired with Russia's ideira attack on our choice.
If Congress were to change the rulers, Trump would have to be right in this body, in what he is preparing to overwhelm the voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
There's a lot of "what about" and I don't mean to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable—or for his counterpart in Europe.
There's a choice to take for us all on both sides of the pond, which will affect how prolonged the battle can be.
In 1938 German officers were ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, only the West had resisted him and helped the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and missed a chance to avoid the years of bloodbathing this led to.
The course of history is about such a turning point, and democracy is accelerated or postponed.
The Americans are facing several of these turning points now.
What will we do if Trump fires Vice-President Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been on deep water since this newspaper revealed that last year he proposed to intercept the president in hiding, and wondered if he was a bad boy for saying the role.
Rosenstein says The Times' description is inaccurate.
‘How will we react if the newly asked FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair — or he is accepted by the Supreme Court despite the threatening accusations of sexual abuse, and dishonest testimony?
And above all, in the middle election, will we vote for a Congress that keeps Trump responsible?
If we fail with these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're wrong, because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czecholovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime as once occupied the country I have my embassy in.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me by the guard to light the Sabbath-lights on the table asking for the swab.
When this is my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before the meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers accept Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that saying above the Australians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will provide a good starting point for them to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A tricked-up midway player Graham Dorrans is doing his first action this season before 2-2 results against Villarreal, but he threatens Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, for Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"I walked into the struggle with the belief that we could get something, and came out again with a point.
Maybe we could take it at the end, but everything in all is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we came out in the second half and were the better made.
On Thursday, it's still a big European evening.
Hopefully we can score three points, but it's going to be a tough fight. They got a good result in their previous fight, but with the audience behind us I'm sure we can run on and get a positive result.
The last year definitely has our hard work, with everything that's happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but now it feels all right.
The bar is good and yellow thrives; the training is good.
Hopefully we can go on now, put the previous season behind us and get lucky."
Women lose sleep over this fear of pension saving
Despite the fact that participants in an investigation had clear thoughts about how they would be taken care of, few people spoke to family members about it.
About half of those who participated in an investigation by the insurance company Nationwide, they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talk to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they don't take the necessary steps to have that conversation," says the Vice President of Nationwide, Holly Snyder.
Here you go.
Talk to your spouse and your young people: You cannot prepare your family to take care of yourself unless you make your wishes known well in advance.
Cooperation with a consultant and your family to discuss where and how you should receive care, as these choices may be a big part of fixing costs.
Get a financial advisor: Your advisor can help you find out how to pay for these expenses.
The funding options for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance, a cash-value life insurance policy to help pay the costs, or that you make sure you don't have your wealth, as long as you have your money.
Create a legal document: Dissociate legal matches before starting.
Get a health authorisation in place, so you appoint a person you trust to oversee your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals act in line with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
You can also assess a mandate for your finances.
You should choose a person you trust to take financial decisions and make sure your bills are paid if you do not have the opportunity to do so yourself.
Don’t forget the small details: Make sure your old parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Write all of these details down in a written form, so you are ready.
"It's not just the finances it's about, but who's the doctors?" asked Martin.
‘What kind of medicine is that?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep the plan ready.’
Man shot several times with air guns in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air gun in what he was on his way home after a trip to the city.
The victim for 40 years was in the area around Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, stomach and hand.
Police art men describe the shooting, which happened around 02.30 local time, as a "random action".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His damage is not life-threatening, and the police ask for witness.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people are killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, public service officials say.
With no communication capability, helpers have not received information from Donggala, a region north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the quake that had a strength of 7.5.
In Palu more than 16 000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi Province, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesiya. The estimated population in 2017 was 379 800.
The city fell into its 40th anniversary when the quake and the tsunami hit.
Doggala is an area which extends more than 300 km along the north-west coast line of the island.
In 2017, the area, which is an administrative region lower than one province, had an estimated population of 299 200.
Fishing and gardening are the berry of the economy of the central Sulawesi Province, special in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is and is important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been slowed down by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, following the disaster reduction office in Indonesia.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed and several hundred houses destroyed by a tsunami in Doggala.
In 1996, the west side of Doggala fell short of a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia lies in the Seismic Ageing of the Pacific and becomes a regular frame of earthquakes.
Here are some of the big quakes and tsunamis in the last few years:
2004: A great quake on the west coast of Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on 26 December, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226 000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of these in Aceh.
2005: A series of big quakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias, outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A quake with a force of 6.8 hit south in Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that penetrated the south coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: A quake with strength 7.6 hit near the town of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people lose their lives.
2010: A quake with a force of 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands outside Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of about 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A small quake hit the Pidie Jaya area in Aceh, causing destruction and panic when people were reminded of the quake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 lost lives due to buildings that rested.
2018: Great earthquake hits the tourist island Lombok and kills more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed several thousand buildings and left several thousand tourists temporarily stranded.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested and aimed for power in the world
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Governor of Alaska and Vice President Sarah Palin, have been arrested, aim of assault.
Following a report released by the Alaskan state police, Palin (29) was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in the reporting of domestic violence and countering arrest.
Following the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance as she tried to call the police to report the crime.
Palin is being held in custody in the Mat-Su prison, and held against bail $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared in court Saturday and declared himself ‘not indebted’ when he was asked, stated the network.
Palin's face is three miscarriages in Class A, which means he can be incarcerated for up to a year and get $25,000 in fines.
He's also been targeted for a class B miscarriage, which can be punished with one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin's been told something criminally.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Mora, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
Saka's up in the veteran court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was aiming for attack in the world, interference in a reporting of the power in the world and to hold a weapon while he was intoxicating with the event.
His girlfriend had claimed that he struck him in the duck.
Sarah Palin was criticised in 2016 by veteran groups after linking his son's violent behavior to PTSD, which stutters from when he served in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of lives lost
At least 384 people have lost their lives after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake, with a strength of 7.5, triggered a tsunami and has broken several thousand homes.
Electricity and communication networks are down, and number of deaths is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit just outside the central part of Sulawesi, which lies north east of the capital of Jakarta.
Videos that show the dramatic moment when the quake hits the social media.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the width.
Federal actors will have rare death sentences for suspicions in New York terrorism
Federal Actors in New York will have the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been committed for a federal offence in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) must have used a rental car from Home Depot to conduct an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway on the lower Manhattan in October, where he drove down pedestrians and nurses on the road.
In order to justify a death penalty, the prosecutors must be able to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims ‘willfully’ and that he ‘willfully’ inflicted serious, physical harm, following a note archived in the South District of New York.
Both of these can be the basis for a possible death penalty, says the legal document.
After the attack, a federal jury handed over a list of 22 prosecution points, including eight screenings for murders with money blackmail objectives, usually used by federal actors in conjunction with organised crime, and a screening for the violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "substantial planning and overlay", said the actors and committed the manner in which Saipov carried out the attack such as "disgusting, cruel, and depraved".
‘Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov cause damage and loss for families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’, notes.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York has been convicted of the death penalty in one case.
The aim, Khalid Barnes, was condemned for killing two baptism providers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being condemned for conspiracy to commit espionage to the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a shortage of indications in the days and months that followed, in accordance with legal documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done most well, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after watching videos from ISIS on the phone, it says indictment.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag in the hospital room, said the police.
He has declared himself not indebted to all charges.
David Patton, one of the federal, public defenders representing Saipov, says they're the "sudden drawer" with the decision of the prosecution.
‘We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty, rather than accepting a declaration of liability for life in prison without any possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma from the event for all those involved’, said Patton.
The defenders of Saipov had previously asked the prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Member of the House in Tory believes Nigel Farage should hire Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to ‘mobilize the people’s army’ today, during a protest at the Tory Lands meeting.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said that politicians had to “feel the pressure” from the Eurosceptics – one of Theresa May’s Members suggested that he should hire negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative, meticulous Member of Parliament, Peter Bone, told the protesters in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "had been out" no, if Farage was a British minister.
With May’s challenge facing its profoundly divided shrimps, it has been underlined by a separate protest in the city, held by Tories who want to stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep the plan with the Chequers compromise on track following attacks by Brexitiers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies insist that it will press for an agreement to be put in place with Brussels, despite the setback – and force the Eurosceptics and the Workers' Party to choose between its package and its 'kaos'.
Bone told Leave Mean Leave Group in Solihull that he would love to "fail Chequers"
He suggested that Farage should be given a proper rank and be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had run, we would be out now," he said.
The Member of the House from Wellingborough added: 'Eg will fight for Brexit, but we must reject Chequers'.
To mark its opposition to the EU, he said: "We do not fight world wars to be subordinate.
We will make our own laws in our own land."
Bone denies the claim that the mill has changed since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British people have changed their meaning and want to become is completely false".
Brexit champions from Tory, Andrea Jenkyns, also participated in the march. She told the reporters, "I only say: Prime Minister, listen to the people!"
"Chequers is not popular in the population; the opposition will not vote for it; it is not popular in our party or our activists who frequent the streets and get us elected initially.
Please drop Chequers and listen to'
In a letter addressed to May, she adds: "State ministers keep their jobs when they keep what they promise".
Farage said that politicians must know the heat if they were to betray the decision that was made in the popular vote in 2016.
"No one is about trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that "we're not going to let them get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to get the political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to know the heat.
"We are mobilizing the peoples of this country who gave us the word in Brexit and are not going to sleep until we have become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom.
At the same time, Remainers marched through the streets of Birmingham before they held a two-hour meeting at the center.
A handful of activists waving the Tories Agest Brexit banner after launching the group this weekend.
Labour-college Lord Adonis fooled the conservatives for the security problems they had with a party app during the opening of the conference.
"This is a human who tells us that they can have all the computer systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, for a frictionless limit, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
‘It's a total farce.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren is planning to take a nice peek to set up the presidential election
The U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll take 'one careful look at making the presidential election' after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that the Democrat of Massachusett is talking about the future of a town meeting west of Massachusett Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, re-elections in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was but as a member of the board of Trump's campaign in Massachusett in 2016.
She has our center for a lot of speculation that she might try against Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump joined.
An attendee asked if she had plans to make Presidential elections.
Warren said it's time that women took their trip to Washington to fix our corrupt government, and it includes a woman at the top."

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the team orders say over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from that moment on the eve that Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the law orders from Mercedes were going to have a major role in the course.
Bottas got a good start on the race, and let Hamilton take care of himself in defending his position the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack the teammate.
Vitel was first into the depot and let Hamilton enter the traffic at the back of the loop, which should be our decision.
The Mercedes went into the depot one round later and came out behind the Vettel, but the Hamilton port ahead after a little action side-by-side that made the Ferrari serene countervilleg had to let the inside be free in danger of being unable to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started, on his 21st anniversary, in the back row and lay in the seventh place at the end of the first round.
After that, he led a large part of the race as he went for a quick conclusion with the goal of driving past Kimi Raikkonen who was in fourth place.
He got into the depot in the 44th round, but he couldn't increase the speed of the last eight rounds while the Raikkonen got the fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did an amazing job all weekend, and was a real gentleman who let me by.
The team has done an exceptional job that has both first and second,” said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fools of Senator Diane Feinstein on an election meeting Saturday due to her insistence that she did not paint the letter from Christine Blasey Ford where she appeals to the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh for sexual abuse.
During a speech at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer to the Ford testimony to the Senate Commission directly, but also commented that what is taking place in the Senate showed that people were "bad and bad and talking untrue".
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days of the Senate, when you see the mind, when you see people who are angry and ugly and uncomfortable and talk untrue," he said.
"When you look at publications and leaks and then say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you think?
Dianne Feinstein, did you plant it?
Thinking of her answer... did you practice the document--"Oh, uh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't eat it."
Please wait a minute.
No, we didn't,' he added, while he imitated the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was played earlier in September--but Feinstein refused for the leak to come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's speakers, I didn't paint her story," said Feinstein to the committee, following The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked for."
But her denial didn't fall in good soil at the president, who commented on it at Saturday's election meeting: "I say you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
While he continues to defend the Supreme Court Nomination, who has been charged with the bad sexual behaviour of three women, the president suggested that the democrats used the charges for their own gain.
‘They are determined to take back power in every way they see it necessary.
You see the badness, the commonness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to gain power and control," said the president in line with Mediaite.

Pilots lose their lives to ensure that hundreds of aircraft escape earthquakes
A flight leader in Indonesia is being hailed as one after he loses his life in what he continues to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers got safely into the air.
More than 800 people have lost their lives and many are missing after a great earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami Friday.
Strong reinstrips continue to disrupt the area, and there are many prisoners in wrecks in the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his colleagues fled for life, Anthony Gunawan Agung (21) refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, even though it swings wildly.
He stayed again to make sure that the plane that was standing on the roller coaster, Batik Air Flight 6321, took off safely.
He then jumped down from the control tower when he thought it collapsed.
He died later in the hospital.
The President of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that decision may have scared hundreds of lives, reported ABC News Australia.
We sent a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in a larger town.
Unfortunately, he went away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
‘This is heart-breaking,’ he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the number of deaths will increase to thousands, while the country's crisis relief agency says that access to the small cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of days is increasing while we find bodies trapped under buildings. "Manufacturer Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said, we can't reach them."
Waves up to six meters have broken Palu, which will keep a mass funeral on Sunday.
Emergency assistance comes in with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with several bodies.
It's hard to find clean water.
Small shops have been robbing.”
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross struggles to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find when they arrive.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday and said to the military in the country: "I ask everyone to work around the clock to do everything they can to help with the evacuation.
Are they clear?' reported CNN.
In Indonesia earlier this year, earthquakes occurred in Lombok, and 550 people died.
Air Niugini is now reporting a missing man after the statutory flight in Micronesia
The air carrier operating an aeroplane that operated in a team in Micronesia of the Pacific Ocean reports that a man is missing, having previously stated that all 47 of the passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the aircraft before it sank.
Air Niugini stated that from Saturday afternoon afternoon they do not know how the human passenger is.
The airline said they work with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The air carrier did not provide any more details about the passenger, and the age and nationality are unknown.
Local boat owners helped to save other passengers and crew after the aircraft forced the water when it tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people were sent to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and everyone was in stable condition.
It's still unknown what caused the crash and what actually happened to her.
Both the airline and the U.S. Marine said that the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
‘That was extremely good,’ said Jaynes.
Jaynes added that he and other passengers were able to water through the water, which cut them up to life, to the emergency exits on the plane before it sank.
He said that the flight crew had panic and fright, and he incurred a head injury that was not serious.
The American Navy said that sailing in the vicinity, working to repair a quay, also scared passengers with a rubber boat that they used to carry passengers to land before the plane sank on about 30 meters.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network website shows that 111 people have died in control of PNG registered airlines for the last 20 years, but none of them flew with Air Niugini.
Analytics make timeline over the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution provided all evidence on Saturday during the appeal trial for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice's analytics Paul Rowlett witness several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He presented to the jury how he breathed recordings from mobile phones to find out what her night was when Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the defendant Quinton Tellis (29).
Following the newspaper The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett stated that he used location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chamber's evening she died, as opposed to what Tellis explained earlier.
When the location data showed that Tellis' cell phone was with Chambers' cellphone at the same time as he said he was with friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
Then Tell Telling Tellis if he told the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that he “slung, because my car was in Nashville.”
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers in about two weeks when she died.
But their mobile phone reports showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers died, delete Tellis messages, calls and Chambers' contact information from his mobile phone.
"He deleted her from his life," said Hale.
The defence shall terminate the proceedings on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to go to the jury later that day.

Another black person?!
Children's passports in New York sue pairs for fired after "racistic" text message
A babysitter in New York sues a couple to kick her off on the basis of discrimination after she got a bug text message from the mother who complained that she was "one more black person."
The couple have refused to be racist, and compared their allegations with ‘expressing’.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was displeased when she saw that the baby passer she had added, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work for the first time in 2016.
‘NEEEEEEEEEEEEIEEI, ENDA EIN SVART PERSON,’ Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, he sent it to the babysitter Maurice, twice.
Having realized her mistake, the inappropriate Plasco-Flaxman gave the babysitter Maurice fired, and said that the previous babysitter, who was afro-American, had done a bad job, so now she would have someone from the Philippines, following the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work before they sent her home in a Uber.
Now, Maurice has been suing her to get compensation for being fired, and she wants $350 a day for six months for the job she should have had, even if it was without a contract, where she was going to live with her family.
"I want to show them that it's not okay to do this," she said to The New York Post on Friday, and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have refused that they are racists, and said that giving Maurice fired was the only thing they could do after having offended her, because they were afraid that she would take revenge.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean to say.
It's not a racist.
We are not racists,' said the husband Joel Plasco to The New York Post.
'But would you leave someone you've taken a little bit of care of your children, even if you didn't mean to insult them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it."
Plasco compared the case with "expressing," and said that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a "excessively difficult situation."
‘Are you really going to take a person in such a situation?
It's not a nice thing to do,' said the investor Plasco.
While the case is taking place, public opinion has been quick to judge the couple on social media, and criticise them for their performance and logic.
The publisher behind the Paddington books was afraid people weren't going to like a talking bear, revealing a new letter
The daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after approval of the first book, commented: "It is difficult to imagine what it was like to read the book for the first time, before it was published.
It's very funny to know how successful Paddington was."
Jankel said that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected.
When it was about Paddington, who she described as ‘a very important member of the family,’ she added that her father was proud of the inside of how successful he did.
"He was a quite quiet man, and he never had fun," she said.
'But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having kids who achieved something: you get proud of them even if it's not really you who's behind it.
I think he looked at Paddington's success that way.
Though it was his creature and his imagination, he always gave all the praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter was going to die and I had to say goodbye to the phone.
When she landed, the daughter was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice in haste, where the games work go to save her life.
'Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, that they didn't think she would manage it,' said Ednan-Laperouse.
'So Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I'm so fond of you, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be right there.
The medical doctors had given her that her heart should continue to pump was slowly on her way out of her system.
She had already died and now the body was about to turn itself off.
I just sat there, knowing that this happened.
I couldn't hide or scream, because I was in a room surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold everything."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now oversaw the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane with other passengers who had no idea what she had just gone through.
'No one knew anything,' she said.
"I set with my head bent while the tears fall."
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I knew how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how happy he was."
Watching women hang notes on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their girlfriends who took suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have pinned notes on a bridge in Wales to inspire and get people who think about taking suicide to change their mind and call their notes.
Davis his son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to wear depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel as I know me every day."
Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said that her son was a talented cook with a smile that infected.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They said that his smile lit up all the rooms."
But before he died, he ended up at work, for he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother of Tyler was the first to find Tyler after he had taken his own life.
Davis said, "I'm still concerned that the little brother may have been affected by Tyler's death."
Davis wrote the note 'for people to know that there are other people out there who care and who they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit there alone - you need to talk to someone."
Humphreys, who has been friend of Davis for many years, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his fun.
"He never told me that he was upset or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed that he began to behave differently.
He was in the cellar emotionally on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifted ones he didn't see them at all."
She said that his death was very traumatic for the children, and they kept working through the trauma: "It's a huge void in our family now.
We're completely broken.
But we all have to fight to live on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts the investigation
"I thought that if we actually got something like what he asked for – a limited investigation – we could perhaps achieve some solitude," said Flake on Saturday, and added that he is afraid the committee "fold together" in the middle of a partisan-backlock.
Why wouldn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They're naked because of timing.
The options in the United States are only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if Republicans don't do it well, this will make it difficult for them to choose Kavanaugh from the U.S. Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley in that way, then has been the secretary of Bush.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
They're going to vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are.
It's still unclear whether Kavanaugh is able to collect at least 50 voices in the Senate, and with 50 voices, Mike Pense, the Vice President of the United States, can give the last voice and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
Number of opponents in North Korea "Go Down" under Kim
Number of North Korean Halls to South Korea has gone down since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, reports a South Korean legislator
Park Byeong-sug referred to data from the South Korean Department of Unit, and said there were 1127 shoppers last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter limits between North Korea and China and more expensive smuggling charges are the main reasons why the number has fallen.
Pyongyang has not expressed himself public.
The vast majority of North Koreans get South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30 000 North Koreans have crossed the limit illegal since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most refugees through China, which have the longest limit with North Korea, are easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China looks at apostates as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, and often sends them back with coercion.
The relations between the North and South Korea – which is still technically at war – have improved over the last few months.
This month the tenants met with the two countries in Pyongyang to negotiate the overthrow of nuclear weapons.
These talks come after the historic meeting in June between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they became enthroned to work for an atomic-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister owed the U.S. Ri Yong-ho not to achieve anything since then.
"Without being able to trust the United States, we can't trust that our country is safe, and in such a situation we can't disarm our weapons first," said Ri in a speech in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric," saying he can't serve in the Supreme Court
Minority lodger Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court, ‘hysteric’ and said that he has too much temperament to serve in the US Supreme Court.
Pelosi calls Kavanaugh "hysteric" in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I know that if a woman had behaved like that, she would have been called "hysterical," said Pelosi about the testimony of Kavanaugh over the Senate court on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and refused all the charges that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech to Kavanaugh, he was very emotional and sometimes cried out with lumps in his neck while he told him about his family and years on.
He criticised the democrats of the Committee, and calling the charges against him "groteske and a planned attack on his reputation," organized by liberal politicians who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi added that she threatens Kavanaugh's testimony to prove that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court, because it shows that he is prejudiced against democrats.
"I believe that the way he behaved on disqualifys him, and what he said about the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi made an objection when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh to leave if he was elected to the Supreme Court, and if the Democrats obtain a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this – if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he can't pee in the Supreme Court, nor in the court he's talking now," added Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is a judge in Washington D.C.'s federal appeal court.
Pelosi also said that as a democrat she is concerned about potential rulings from Kavanaugh against law known as Obamacare and the matter of Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm Kavanaugh, he refused to answer questions if he came to turn some decisionrs in the Supreme Court.
"It's not the right time for a hysterical, prejudiced person in the Supreme Court who expects us to say he's great," said Pelosi.
And women have to swing the sword
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of rage, and she doesn't get it out without crying.
'We cried when we're angry,' Steinem said to me 45 years later.
'I don't think it's unusual, do you?'
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high company position, who said that she had an argument when she was angry, but developed a technique where she said to the person who made her so angry that she had an argument, "You might think I'm sorry because I cried.
I'm angry."
And then it just keeps going.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears act like a way to get the mind out, but there are many who misunderstand.
In one of my strongest memories of a previous job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I realized, and a woman who was older than me took me to the neck – she was a cold clay that I had always lived for – and pulled me out at a time.
'Never let them see you cry,' she said to me.
"You don't know you're furious.
They think you're upset and they won because they made you cry."
Patricia Schroeder, who at that time was a congressman, a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, Hart was taken to be engaged on a boat called Monkey Business, and withdrew from the campaign.
'I hadn't really thought about it well enough,' she said to me while she laughed, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates who made choices, and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Some call the situation "Snife White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had already been going on for a while, she had not collected enough money, so she promised she would only keep quiet if she managed to collect $2 billion.
It was impossible.
She discovered that her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she asked.
When she declared that she was not going to put to the election anyway, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and aim on the voters instead of the delegates, and mind against sex discrimination, that she began to cry during the speech.
'You'd think I had a nervous breakdown,' Schroeder said about how the press reacted when it worked.
"You'd think Kleenex was my lead sponsor.
I think I'm thinking, what are they going to write on my gravestone?
‘Ho branch’?’
How the trade war between the United States and China may be good for Beijing
The opening story of the trade war between the United States and China was irritable, and while the battle persists, a tear between the two countries can be an advantage for Beijing in a long time, say experts.
The American president Donald Trump shot the first shot this year to tax important Chinese exports, including solar panel, steel and aluminium.
The battle escalated this week, with tariffs on articles worth over $200 billion, which in effect means that half of all goods from China to the United States are being taxed.
Beijing has taken the home and set tariffs between five and ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States for every shot those guys off, and the second largest economy in the world is probably not going to end with the first one.
To get Washington to end, China has to do what the United States wants, but to bow to the United States is too whistled for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Yet, experts say that if Beijing keeps the head cold, the American press can have a positive effect on the Chinese economy in the long term, by reducing the degree of dependence between the two economies.
‘The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Beijing can cause both economies to go under is dangerous than people would have to admit before,’ said Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for American Security, a thought-mie.
Syria 'ready' for the return of refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria says they are ready to accept refugees who will return voluntarily and ask for help to rebuild the land that is broken after more than seven years in war.
When he spoke to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that relations in the country are making progress.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas that are destroyed by terrorists in order to re-enter normal areas.
All journeys are now in place to allow refugees to return voluntarily to their country from the ground of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that went beyond their daily lives and living.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have fled the country since the war started in 2011.
More than six million people in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would like to accept help to rebuild the corrupt country.
But he pointed out that they are not going to accept assistance or assistance with conditions from countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe ensures in Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 when they beat the American team with a final score of 16.5 versus 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost on European soil six times in a row, and they haven't won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown of the team of the Danish Captain, Thomas Bjørn, they reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mikkelson beat most of the tournaments, and he hit the ball in the water from the tea- at the hole 16, par 3, and therefore gave the story to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari did well in all its rounds and became one of four players that ever got 5-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was kicked out 5/4 by the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's highest rank, became 2 and 1 after English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has divided in eight Ryder Cupar, became the most winning European with 25.5 points in careers.
"Mostly I don't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a long year.
So thankful that Thomas chose me and trusted me.
I'm so, so glad to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European saying.
He goes on to make the staffman John Ram, who beat the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2/1 in single games on Sunday.
‘I know a tremendous pride in beating Tiger Woods, I wake up looking at him,’ said Rahm (23).
Woods lost all four of his matches in France, and now has a record of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup through the careers.
A strange statistics from one of the world's best players, who have won 14 major titles and are only turned off by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team went out to find the fairway all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who impressed with high-level golf throughout the entire tournament.
Jim Furyk, the U.S. Captain, spoke out after a disappointing display from his team.
There were periods this morning where we made it hot for Europe.
It's a fight.
Hat off for Thomas.
He's a sole captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with PGA in America and our Ryder Cup Committee and move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
One must take off his hat.
We were played."
