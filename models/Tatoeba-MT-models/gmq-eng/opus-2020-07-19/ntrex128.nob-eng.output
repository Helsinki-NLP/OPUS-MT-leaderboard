Welsh MEPs do not wish to appear as 'muppies'
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, who are now known under the abbreviation AM (Assembly Members), are not entirely satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes from the plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives from all over the political spectrum fear that this can lead to ridicule.
A representative of the Labour Party Labour explained his group was concerned because ‘it rhymes at Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means "dustee", and pwp means "push".
A representative of the Wales party Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole was ‘dissatisfied’ and that they have proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh part of the conservative party said that his group was ‘open’ for the change of name, but noted that the pronunciation of MWP is very close to the word ‘Muppet’, which in addition to being the name of some known dolls, is also a British slang word for ‘dust’.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced in a similar way as the letter U is pronounced in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like a "uh" sound.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the change of name, said: "It is of course the members themselves who have the last right of destination as to the name by which they are to be referred."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorised the Welsh National Assembly to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation which showed general support for the renaming of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of representatives, the Commission supported WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members), but the MWP option was most supported during the public consultation.
It seems that the representatives are proposing other alternatives, but to get all parties to reach an agreement could lead to the headship of Vice-President Elin Jones, who will be submitting a legislative draft for the change of name in the next few weeks.
The legislation on reform will include other changes in the functioning of the national Parliament, including rules on disqualification of representatives and the design of the committee system.
Representatives have the last voting rights on what to call them when discussing the law.
Macedonians go to the polls to determine whether the country's name is to be changed
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia may vote for the name of their country to be replaced by the ‘Republic of North Macedonia’.
The referendum will be held in an attempt to resolve several decades of dispute with the neighbouring Greece, which also has a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour is a claim on their territory and has on several occasions opposed its application for membership of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the popular vote for the change of name, has said that he will ignore the vote.
The supporters of the popular vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change of name is simply the price they have to pay for participating in the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Styler – the bells of Harlem's wearer
"The old ones I spoke with have told me that before in time there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Adams.
‘Now there are none of the parts.’
He said the absence of the bars was understandable.
People socially associate each other in other ways now, he says.
‘Bars are no longer local meeting places, which all visit regularly.’
As for the churches, he fears that the money from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders think. "And sooner or later they are back at the beginning."
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who won't help the neighborhood's remaining havens.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and therefore will only speed up the day when these churches have to close the doors too well, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both branches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist Society moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had held near took over the building.
St. Martin's received a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the dealers on 125th Street – one of Harlem's main handmasters – because they failed to employ or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 damaged the building, and when Father Johnson's parishiones planned to rebuild, they bought a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St Martin's, proudly declared that the carillonet was "the church bell of the poor people".
The expert who played the carillonet in July called it something different: ‘a cultural tax’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
Expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillonet in the world to be played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillonet at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merryweather, St. Martin's has never replaced him.
What has happened at St. Martin's in the last few months is a complex interaction between architects and entrepreneurs, some of which are part of the church’s legion management and others of the bishopy.
The Church Council – the administration of the church, composed of legionists – wrote to the Bispedia in July about its concern that the Bispedia would ‘try to force the costs’ of the church council, despite the fact that the Church Council had not been involved in the introduction of the architects or contractors sent by the Bispedia.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency by the bishopial office.
Hai damage thirteen-year-olds to lobster duvets in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he appeared after lobsters in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends in about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help, and that he and a group of others swam over to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel he first thought that the boy cried out of enthusiasm for having caught a lobster, but he realized afterwards that the boy shouted 'I was bitten!'
I was bitten!"'
His whole collarbone was torn up," said Hammel, who discovered the damage when he reached the boy.
'I cried out that everyone had to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'' added Hammel.
The guy was transported with air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The type of head that carried out the attack is not known.
Bathing Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim was seriously injured in the upper torso.
The authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to make his contribution to the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with departmental-like makeup and beauty shelves, manned by specially trained staff.
The extended shelves are tested in 11 shops around the country as part of a strong intake in the UK's 2.8 million beauty care market, which is constantly growing while the sales figures for clothing and home articles are falling. If the experiment is successful, the concept will be extended to several shops next year.
The investment in beauty care is the result of supermarket attempts to find a new use of space previously used for televisions, microwaves and home articles.
Sainsbury's said they would double the number of beauty products they offer to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the shop chain has never sold before.
Existing product selection from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also have a better place in labelled brands, just as in shops like Boots.
The Supermarket chain also relaunches its Boutique make-up brand with mainly vegan products, because there is an increasing demand for this among younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer The Fragrance Shop should test out sales tables in two Sainsbury's shops. One opened in Croydon in South London last week, while the other opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet commerce and a new tendency to buy small amounts of food daily from local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that sales are going to look more and more like a warehouse, as the supermarket addresses the fight against the cheap Aldi and Lidl stores with more services and goods without food.
Sainsbury's placed Argo's sales in hundreds of shops, and has also introduced a series of Habitat sales after purchasing both chains two years ago.
The previous supermarket attempt to upgrade the beauty and pharmacy department was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a cooperation with Boots early in the 2000s, but the cooperation was closed after a quarrel regarding the distribution of the income from pharmacy in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 shop caps to Celesio, owner of the pharmacy chain Lloyd's Pharmacy, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a sample of luxury skin care labels, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's trade manager, said, "We've transformed the appearance and design of the beauty shelves to create a more inviting environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who will then be ready to give advice and help.
Our brand selection is designed to meet all needs, and the inviting surroundings and practical locations make us now a beauty contester representing a new shopping experience."
Peter Jones is ‘pussing’ after Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement worth GBP 11 million
Dragons' Den-star Peter Jones is supposed to be furious after TV-host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million agreement with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessory brand, Truly.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop.
Willoughby (37) who is Programme Manager in This Morning announced on Instagram that she left the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' The Star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle brand in the last second to focus on their own new gold-edged contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “pussy” at an exciting meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. It was here that her new contracts – worth up to GBP 1.5 million – meant that she no longer has time for left over to their clothing and accessories brand, Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop, and it was expected that it would double Willoughby's estimated fortune of GBP 11 million.
At the same time that Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she is going to leave True, Jones Great Britain left for one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's first priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her financial security over the next decades.
Everyone is completely shocked that she has chosen to withdraw.
There was no one who could believe that when it happened last Tuesday – it was just before the launch.
Now there is a store full of goods at Marlow headquarters, which is now ready for sale.”
Experts believe that this Morning Programme Manager, who is among the most popular stars in the United Kingdom, may cost the company several million pounds due to large investment in products such as cushions and light,mote and cosecle, as well as a potential delay in launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The three-child mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the last ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became Chairman of the Board in March.
The two pairs go on vacation together, and Jones has 40 % ownership in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall become a branded ambassador for M&S and shall replace Ant McPartlin hosting the I'm A Celebrity programme.
A source near Jones said yesterday "We will not comment on his business dealings".
Chefs "and then we fell in love"
He knew about the criticism he would receive from the news media for having made a comment some would consider as “little president”, and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given away so much?
Trump said in his imitation of a news anchor.
‘I have not given away anything.’
He remarked that Kim was interested in a new meeting, after having itself declared that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a big dirt on the road to nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, North Korea’s top diploma Ri Yong Ho world leaders told the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a ‘equal response’ from the United States in its early disarmament measures.
He noted that instead the United States still has sanctions that are intended to keep the pressure up.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for a assembly of his electors.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war against North Korea.
Many million people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his work to improve the relationship with Kim has given positive results, such as putting a stop to rockets, helping to get released hostages and to get the living after American officials sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to act with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this busy arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here," said Trump and pointed in the area right in front of him.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia breed an island and kill several hundred people
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, non-profit institutions serving non-profit institutions were told their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 % of Lombok residents had lost their homes, a national disaster was not declared, which is a requirement for international assistance to be submitted.
‘In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it quite clear that they are not asking for international help, so that it is quite challenging’, Sumbung explained.
Save the children now put together a team to travel to Palu, but are not yet sure if foreign staff will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the National Emergency Management Institute, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations are allowed to contribute to the relief work.
Taking into account the earthquakes to which Indonesia is constantly exposed, the country is horribly poorly prepared to cope with nature's anger.
Lys to protect against tsunamis are built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of an alert sire in Palu, although an alert had been sent out, has probably contributed to the death numbers.
Even in the best circumstances, it is a challenge to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquakes is heading for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widod made an upgrade of Indonesia's ready-made infrastructure to a key point in his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on the road and rail.
But lack of money has been a major problem for Joko's administration, which will be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have turned to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and several tens of thousands had to flee their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs struck the streets with mashedets, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge with late equalization in battle against Chelelse
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from the Premier League loss against Chelsea on Saturday by cutting for 89 minutes in the game at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from the Chelsea target while his team lay 1-0 behind it.
He moved the ball to the left before he sent it to the longest corner.
The experiment went high over the box as the ball hid towards the top right corner of the grid.
The ball finally went over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the web.
‘I was just trying to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq always send the ball forward as well as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible,’ said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
‘I saw Kante come and touched the ball once and thought not too much of it and just kicked it over.’
Chelsea led by 1-0 at the break, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a target for 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker sent a passport with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic, before changing direction near the midway and sprinted into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic came with a quick handover on the midway.
He then fired a great breakthrough that led Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner of a left foot kick past Liverpool Alisson Becker.
Liverpool plays against Naples in the group game of Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in the European League in football for men in London at 3 p.m. on Thursday.
The death rates of the tsunami in Indonesia reach 832
The death rates following Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami have risen to 832, notified the country’s emergency management meeting early on Sunday.
It was reported that many were caught in the ruins of buildings collapsing after the earthquake with a strike of 7.5 that hit the country on Friday and caused waves of up to six metres, explained the speech of the entatist Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380 000 inhabitants, was full of materials from hilly buildings.
Police arrest a man (32) for killing after a woman gets stabbed to death
A killer research is initiated after the corpse of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with a stab wound at 7:55 in Grayson Mews, John Street, a 32-year-old man is attacked, suspected of killing.
The police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything about contacting them.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says, "We're all at the beginning of the investigation, but I'll ask everyone who was in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and then or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
We also ask everyone, especially the taxi driver, who may have caught up something on his camera, to make contact – they may have information that is essential for our investigation.”
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the deceased woman was resident in Birkenhead, and that she was found in a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have said that they are working to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been told that no one is allowed to go in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will take several hours to get back in.
A police officer was interrogated, telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a place to go.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She repeats "it's so horrible" over and over again.
At 14 a.m., two police cars stood behind the barrier, while a third car was just outside.
A number of police officers stood outside the barracks and had oversight of the apartment complex.
Persons who have information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, by referring to "log 247" from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last memorial drawn into the quarrel of ‘rewriteing history’
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures that were carried out by his fanatical Puritan trailers.
But the story team Comwell Society has described Jeremy Crick's publisher as "bad" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, director of the Cromwell Society, says: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace also came to be a goal.
The iconoclass of the British Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's fantastic representation of Cromwell is a proof of the 1800s' opinions and is part of a history to a man many still think deserves to be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell will be by many, perhaps more late in the 1800s than today, as Parliament's defender of outside press – in his time, of course, there was talk of the monarchy.
Whether this is an exact representation is still the subject of historical debate.
What's certain is that the conflict in the mid- 1600s has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognisable figure representing one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering.”
Drapsgris kills Chinese peasant
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in South West China, according to local news reports.
The man, mentioned only with the surname ‘Yuan’, was found dead and covered with blood from a torn artery near a binge on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to put vaccines in pigs on a farm on 30 May 2005 in the city of Xining, Qinghai province of China.
He had apparently traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the cousin found him dead, and discovered that the gate of a nearby pig was open.
He said inside the pig path there was a big error with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kg pig had killed the man.
“The sole of my cousin was bloody and maltrated,” explained the cousin, referred to with the surname Wu, in a quote to Guiyang Evening News.
Security cameras recorded that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
While the police collected evidence from the scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked in to prevent it from attacking anyone else.
Yuan's family and the management of the market are clearly negotiating compensation for death.
Even though it happens, it's not the first time it's been registered that a pig has infected people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple at a farm in Massachusetts, and caused serious damage to the man.
Ten years earlier a Welsh farmer was pushed up against a tractor and attacked by a pig of 300 kg until the farmer's wife managed to chase the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to CBC News explained that pigs are not aggressive to normal, but that the taste of blood may have a triggering effect.
‘They're just playing.
They like to bite, and they're very curious... they're not trying to hurt anybody.
You just have to show sufficient respect."
The rest of Hurricane Rosa will lead to heavy rain in the south-west of the United States
As reported, Hurricane Rosa is weakened as it moves across the cooler sea on the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa will, however, bring flood rain on its journey through North Mexico and south-west US over the next few days.
Rosa had a wind force of 135 km/h and was a hurricane of category 1 at 05:00 ET on Sunday, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a tree begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward to the west coast of the United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm of precipitation in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the interaction between tropical humidity and the near trawl will lead to widespread heavy south-west rain over the next few days.
Locally 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous floods, liquid rushes and fast and possible landslides in the desert.
Dyptropic humidity will lead to precipitation rates of up to 5 to 7 cm per hour in some areas, in particular areas south of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5–10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the south-west, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There are opportunities for floods with rapidly worsening conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is very unwise to move around in the desert on foot as long as there is a danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause escalators to become wide-breathing rivers, and thunder will lead to local gusts of wind that can contain dust and sand.
The approaching trot will lead to local heavy rain showers for parts of the coast along South California.
Total rainfall over 1.3 cm is possible, and this can lead to liquid rush and fast, as well as smooth roadways.
This will be the area's first rainfall of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to corner states on Tuesday and persist all Wednesday.
October can cause some intense temperature fluctuations throughout the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder but the tropics stay very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We'll see a clear example of strong temperature differences throughout the central US on Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, renewable summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and east US will probably get a warm start in October, with degrees high in twenty from Southern Plains to parts of the north-east US.
New York City can reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday – this will be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate message indicates that East-USA is most likely to have temperatures higher than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people looked at Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers, divided into six television networks, saw Thursday's arresting witness from the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused him of a sexual assault that should have taken place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political coward continued, and the broadcasters interrupted their regular broadcasts to advertise Friday's great surprise in the last second, when it came to the fact that the Senator of Arizona, Jeff Flake, had arranged for the FBI to conduct a weekly investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate court that she is 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh felt her and tried to take off her clothes at a college party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he is 100 percent certain that this did not happen.
The shipment on Friday was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average ratings for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Seeer numbers were not immediately available for other networks that showed the consultation, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring office viewers.
To give you a little perspective, these are ratings that correspond to the playoffs in the U.S. football championship or the Oscar distribution.
Fox News Channel, whose meaning hosts have supported Kavanaugh's appointment with great enthusiasm, led among the networks, with average ratings of 5.69 million for the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still great after the hearing.
Flake was the main character of Friday's drama.
The moderate republican's office gave an opinion that he would vote in the favor of Kavanaugh. On Friday morning he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras, trying to take the elevator to a meeting of the court board while demonstrators screamed and shouted at him.
He was standing with a lowered glance for several minutes while he was disputed, while the event was sent directly to CNN.
"I'm standing here just in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he tells the country our truth?"
He was told that "you have the power when so many women are powerless".
Flake pointed out that his office has made an opinion, and said, as the elevator doors closed down, that he would have more to say about the matter at committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all the hearing directly several hours later, when the court board would vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should be continued to the entire Senate for reconciliation.
But Flake said he was only willing to do this if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate by next week, to which the democratic minority has called.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flakes' choice had a great impact, as it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses the critics of "political games" around Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May accused the opponents of her plan to leave the EU to run ‘political games’ with the future of the United Kingdom and undermine the interests of the nation.
The UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, pressed side by side with her own on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued her attack on her so-called ‘Chequers’ plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal for the United Kingdom and the EU to collect each other’s tariffs was ‘totally ridiculous’.
Wayde Sims shooting: The police attack Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of causing the LSU's death
The police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player of Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) has been arrested and subjected to deliberate killing, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities have released a video recording of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his brilliants during the basketball roof.
The police found the spectacles at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS partner WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that he confessed to have shot and killed Wayde.
His bail is set to USD 350 000, according to The Advocate.
The forensics in East Baton Rouge Parish published a preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death is indicated as a gunshot wound in the head and through the neck.
The police thank Louisiana Stat Police for its team for collecting refugees, the state police lab, the Southern University police and locals for contributing to the investigation that led to an attack.
LSU’s sports leader Joe Alleva thanked the area’s police force for his ‘hard work and pursuit of justice’.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m high forward-player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for the LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said that the layer was "knuckle" and "in shock" after Wayde's death.
"This is what we fear at all times," said Wade.
Volcan sprinkling ash over Mexico City
The ash that sprinkled out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost neighbourhoods of Mexico's capital.
Centro Nacional de Prevenar de Desastres, Mexico’s public emergency prevention meeting, warned Mexico’s population on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after the activity rose in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within one day.
The etate monitored several cases of bunning and shaking.
Social media images showed a thin layer of ash that covered windscreens on the cars in the neighborhood as Xochimilco in Mexico city.
Geophysicians have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is 72 km southeast of the capital after a 7,1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after Protestant independence had a conflict with the police, while several thousand participated in competing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalan polarizing vote on emancipation.
A group of masked separatists were held back by the uprising police, and bombarded them with egg and powder paint, which caused dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
Handcuffs also broke out later in the day, when the police used batons to limit fighting.
For several hours, independent demonstrators cried out "Never forget, never forgive", face to face with Unionist demonstrators calling "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they received during protests, according to the local press.
The tension remains high in the release-oriented region one year after the popular vote on 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist catalists.
The vote showed an overwhelming excess of freeage, but it was a bad meeting because the vote was boycotted by most who opposed the release.
According to the Catholic authorities, almost 1000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after the police tried to stop the vote that was conducted at polls across the region.
Release teams camped in the streets last night to Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was still held, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had hopes of Catalonia's ability to become independent.
'Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy at getting a vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catholic independence have had problems keeping pressure up this year, as many of their well-known leaders have traveled in self-charged exiles or are in custody while awaiting legal proceedings for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest to support the police, said that the conflict was raised by politicians on both sides.
‘The situation is becoming increasingly tense’, he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison waiting for a trial since late last year, announced that he will stand for elections in the European Parliament next year.
‘To stand as a candidate in the European elections is the best thing I can do to condemn the repression and regression from democratic values we have seen from the Spanish Government’, he said.
Londonderry: People arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 years are arrested after a car was driven several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said that the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired against the car at some point.
Mengas attack leads to Livingston's 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Mengas's first goal for Livingston secured the victory
Depressing Livinston astonished Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
A good hit from Dolly Menga turned out to be crucial, and Gary Holt's side is now equal to Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side has still not won on the way away in the Premier League this season and is going to play against the leaders of Hearts, which are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers will be playing home fight against Rapid Wien in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on his side, has kept himself unswerving through six games in the division.
Livingston misses opportunities against her quiet guests
Holt's team should have led long before they scored, as their direct procedure caused countless problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but missed at the goal, and Alan Lithgow could only send kicked forward after sliding in to meet Craig Hallkett's header past the goal.
The host allowed Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could make troubles for their guests at deathball.
And that's how the crucial goal came into being.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson co-operation to give Menga a clear track, and he scored a goal from the middle of the box.
Within this stage the Rangers had had the ball mostly all the time, but the home team's defense had proved to be impenetrable and goalie Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed a almost scoring which had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of the Rangers Emperor Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston death ball in one at a short pass.
Crossings still came into the Livingston box and were still saved, while two criminal charges — once after the Hakkett protest against the trades of Glenn Middleton, and once by hand — were ignored.
Phenomenal from Livingston Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were amazing all of them, and continue to surpass all expectations on the road upwards.
The playing style and the crew have hardly changed since they got to the top again, but Holt should have a lot of credit for the way he has strengthened the team after his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was amazing and coordinated a hugely well-organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on toe toe throughout the fight.
The Rangers, on the other hand, did not have my inspiration to divorce.
Although at times they have been very good under Gerrard, they couldn't live up to this standard.
The last part of the fight was the labs – they only got into the home layer's path half once – and it was a bit of a wake-up for the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed receipt in Cologne
Everything was just smile and blue sky on Saturday 29 September, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate lunch together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the NATO allies.
There has been a division of issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and the entry of Turkey into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police provided security as the reason why a 25 000 population was not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many trailers met up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — many of them Kurds — also heard from them, criticising both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to let him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the divide that follows a man who is hailed as a hero of some German Turks and hates as an autocrat of others.
Deptford collision: Cyclast killed in a collision with a car
A cyclist is killed in a collision like with a passenger car in London.
The collision took place in the crossing between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a busy road in the Deptford southeast of the city, about 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the sick list was treated by ambulance personnel, but the man died on the spot.
The collision takes place only one month after a cyclist died in a driveway where the driver escaped from the scene of Children's Street, about one mile from the collision of Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said the police are working to identify the man and alert the relatives.
Road barriers and bus transfers are in place and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers are injured in an incident at a high-security prison for men, according to prison authorities.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09.30 BST on Sunday, and are still going on.
Specialized Tornado officers have been picked up to handle the event, involving eight prisoners and are restricted to one wing.
The officers were treated for minor facial damage on site.
A prison spokesperson said: "Special trained prison staff have been sent in to handle an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons – those responsible will be transferred to the police, and may have to spend even more time behind locks and punches.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous perpetrators.
In June, it was reported that the head of prison received hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmates.
And last October, the rebel police were called in to deal with a serious incident in which employees were attacked by billiards.
The Orkan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flood (may be beneficial for droughts)
It's the source Arizona is being taken by a tropical lprint, but it's probably going to happen early next week, with Hurricane Rosa's remaining force moving through the desert areas in the southwest and carrying flood risk.
National Weather Service has already issued flood warning for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, south-east California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rainstorm will start late Monday evening.
National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only ‘ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the Arizona border.”
The most recent National Hurricane Center models predict 5-10 cm of precipitation, up to 15 cm in some places in Mongolia Rim in Arizona.
Other areas within the desert in the southwest, including the centre of Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to reach between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of precipitation is possible in some areas.
For those who are outside the floodfare, Rosa can be a blessing, as the area suffers from drought.
Although floods are a serious problem, some of these precipitations are likely to be beneficial, since the south-west United States is currently in a drought state.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, a little over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, according to weather.com.
First, the Hurricane Rosa land hits at the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa still has Hurricane Power on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind force of 137 km, is 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is moving 19 km/h.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific, thereby losing power.
Therefore, it is expected to hit Mexico with tropical storm forces on Monday evening or afternoon.
The precipitation of parts of Mexico can be powerful and lead to great flooding.
‘Total precipitation of 7,5–15 cm is expected from Baja California to Northwest Sonora, with possibilities for up to 25 cm of precipitation’, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move northward over Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the border of Arizona dawning Tuesday morning as a tropical lprint, as this is moving further through Arizona and into southern Utah by the late Tuesday evening.
‘The main hazard expected by Rosa or the rest of it is very heavy precipitation in Baja California, north-west Sonora and the south-west desert of the United States’, according to the National Hurricane Center.
This precipitation is expected to produce lethal floods and liquid rushes and fast in the desert and landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Attacks for Homicide
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man are attacked, suspected of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area by Midsomer Norton around 04:00 BST on Sunday.
He was driven to the hospital, and his condition should be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man was attacked during the night in the Radstock area, according to the police in Avon and Somerset.
The police have asked anyone who may have mobile recordings of the incident to contact.
Trump says that Kavanaugh has “felt under the littleness and mind” of the democratic party
‘A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the democratic party,’ said Trump ahead of a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has suffered under the littleness and mind of the democratic party throughout the process of nomination.
Kavanaugh witnessed in front of the Congress on Thursday, and denied the powerful and emotional accusations of Christine Blasey Ford that he committed a sexual assault on her several decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testifies to his accusation during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw how brilliant, capable and courageous" Kavanaugh was that day.
‘A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to support one of today’s most skilled lawyers, with spot-free conduct in public service,’ he told a assembly of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred the dispute to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about how important it is that the Republicans vote at the inter-choices.
"We are five weeks away from one of our lifetime's most important choices.
I'm not really a participant, but I'm a participant," he said.
"That's why I travel around fighting for the best candidates."
Trump claimed that democrats aim to "to resist and prevent".
The Senate's first middle vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to the assistant of a leader of the Republican Party to CNN.
Several hundred killed by Indonesian landslides and tsunami, the figures are expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were dragged to sea by huge waves that were thwarted against the beaches when a large earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to a festival at the beach in the town of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters of high waves downlanded around sunset, destroyed everything in their way and dragged many into drowning death.
The Tsunami came into the heels of an earthquake with a force of 7.5.
“When the tsunamifaren appeared yesterday, people still operated on the beach, did not escape immediately and ended up as victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of Indonesia’s crisis management establishment (BNBP) at a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami was not alone – it took cars, wooden tribes and houses, it hit everything on land,” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coastline.
Some climbed up trees to escape from the tsunami and survived."
Around 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Air photographs published by the crisis management set showed many damaged buildings and shops, distorted and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftersquakes continued shaking the coastal town on Saturday.
The race of earthquakes could be felt by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Institute for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the power of Friday’s huge earthquake was about 200 times more than the power of the nuclear bomb released over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami larger, according to the etate.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the numbers of deaths and injuries could be larger country coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, located near the heart of the earthquake.
The communication was ‘fully spoiled, completely uninformed’ from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
More than 300 000 people live there," said Red Cross in a press release, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
‘This is already a tragedy, but it may get much worse.’
On Saturday it was strongly criticised for not having informed that a tsunami had taken Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had taken before the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording divided by social media, a man at the top floor is told by a building shouting desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching passersby on the street below.
In a few minutes, a wall of water comes thriving towards the beach, tearing up buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately authenticate the recordings.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a major power breach that has prevented communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The military has begun to send transport aircraft using Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other needs.
The city airport is only open for ancillary work, and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The numbers of deaths after the tsunami in Indonesia rise above 800.
It's really cruel.
World Vision's personnel from Donggala have come safely to the center of Palu, where they have sought shelter under the tarpaulin in the courtyard in front of their office, but they passed great destruction on the road, according to Dosaba Sinay.
"They told me they saw hundreds of broken houses," he said.
It's really cruel.
While relief organisations began dismal preparations to provide emergency assistance, some complained that foreign workers with a great deal of expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released into a crisis area until declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't yet happened.
‘It is still a provincial disaster,’ said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for Indonesian Red Cross.
‘When the government says ‘Greit, this is a national disaster’, we can open the limits to international aid, but the situation has not yet got any status.’
As the sun goes down over Palu for the second time after Friday's earthquake and tsunami hopes friends and family of those who are still missing that their dear should be among the miracle stories that light up the bleak news of tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was fished out of a sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was delivered by rescue crews after spent two days trapped under the ruins of her mother's dead body next to her mother.
Gendon Subandino, the coach of the national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asia games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those caught in the ruins of Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
"As a paragliding senior, I have my own emotional ought to carry," he said.
Gendon said that in the hours after the news about the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding environment he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the performers who participated in the beach festival at Palu.
But the messages only led to gray hook marks, rather than a few blue hook marks.
“I think that means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves steals USD 26 750 under Newport on the Liver minibank refill
Friday morning, thieves stole USD 26 750 from a Brink's worker who filled a minibank in Newport on the Living, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied a minibank in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, there was another man who “run up behind the Brink's staff” and stole a bag of money that was to be delivered.
Witnesses so many suspected escapes from the scene, according to the press release, but the police have not specified how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity has to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name - to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "The mission previously known as Kanye West."
West (41) has had the nickname Ye for a long time, and used the name as the title of its eighth album, which was launched in June.
The change comes before his action on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected that he will launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande at the program, after she cancelled on an emotional basis, according to the comic bookmaker.
In addition to being a abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious significance to him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year, when he discussed the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
'So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye -- as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more a representation of who we are."
He is one of many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously cooperated with West, has also varied between the use of dashes and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use military against civilians
Mexico's acceding President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has sworn that he will never use military power against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he ‘never will use the military to suppress the Mexican people’.
Military troops shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square of October 2, 1968, and killed as many as 300 people, during a period when left-wing student movements took root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to students and opening several free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people into criminals.
The United States should double financial support for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, investor and performing artificial intelligence, which has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements about artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the United States in general does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, on its side, introduced a plan last year and aims to be number 1 in the field of artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
‘A dual research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough,’ said Lee.
Double financial support can double the chance that the next big performance in artificial intelligence comes from the United States,” Lee told me in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is Director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop an artificial intelligence system that struck the best Othello player in the United States, and later was a leader of Microsoft Research or Director of the Chinese department of Google.
Lee acknowledged the US government's previous technology contests, like Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one will be held, to help find the next generation's wise heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government appropriations, according to Lee.
‘It is not China that steals the academic leaders, it is the companies,’ said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed wise heads from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in artificial intelligence.
"I believe that those who have a doctorate in artificial intelligence should receive an offer for a residence permit automatically," he said.
The Chinese Government issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China finances people at academic institutions, in a similar way to the National Science Foundation and other government organisations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Defense Department set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, they are currently investing more than USD 100 million in research into artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the US law aimed at establishing a national safety commission on artificial intelligence has been suspended for several months.
Macedonians vote in public vote on whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a popular vote on Sunday on whether to change the country’s name to the ‘Republic of North Macedonia’ to resolve a number of decades away from Greece, which has blocked their attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia, believes that the name of the northern neighbour is a claim on the Greek territory and has made no sense of including them in NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June based on the proposed new hub, but nationalistic opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and a booting campaign has raised doubts about the meeting will meet the minimum 50 percent requirement, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question on the voting note is, ‘If you are for NATO and EU membership when approving the agreement with Greece’.
Those who support the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that occurred after the fall of Yugoslavia, to be eligible for membership of organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU’s protective umbrella, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, it is likely to be crucial because a large number of Members have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote.
The change in the name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The Election Commission of the State said that they had not received any irregular reports by 13.00.
However, the meeting was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent at the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters gave their vote.
“I came to vote because of my children – we belong in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski (62) who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The referendum in Macedonia is about changing the country’s name in order to open the doors for them to become members of NATO and the EU.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) made a small scene and drew up chairs in front of tents set up by those who are going to boycott the vote.
"We are positive to NATO and the EU, but we want to be reported with raised heads, not getting in the backside," says Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our value.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries such as China and Russia and become part of European integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will lead to a coercive investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
‘I think most people will be for, because more than 80 of our citizens want us to become members of the EU and NATO,’ Zaev said after voting.
He says that a 'yes' response will be a 'confirmation of our future'.
According to a questionnaire published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, between 30 and 43 per cent of the voting rights will participate in the referendum — this is lower than the required meeting.
Another study, conducted by Makedonia’s Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of the respondents have plans to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they were going to vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the meeting must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious political obstacle the pro-West government has encountered since it took over last May.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero manoeuvres past the entire Brighton defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 owner on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a goal for 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a passport at the start of the sequence.
He ran about the race with three Brighton defenders before he got out on the open track.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender before he ran from several on the edge of the Brighton-box.
Then he sent a passport to the left that reached Sterling.
The English attacker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used right shoes to beat Brighton's Caesar Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
«Aguero is still struggling with some foot problems», said the City Manager Pep Guardiola to the press.
"We talked about that he was going to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was lucky that he scored a goal just then."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the original advantage of the Premier League fight.
This goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball put in Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough pass along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a few contacts before he led Sterling towards the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the net just before it was over the dead line.
City plays against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12:55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be a spoiler for Rockies
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs, and have no reason to bet heavily.
The always equally competitive Scherzer hopes to stand on the track on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoff possibilities of the Colorado team, which leads over Los Angeles Dodgers with one battle in NL West.
Rockies got a wild card place with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday evening, but is still looking to secure their first division title.
Even though we don't have anything to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the mood here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will be the most likely to be the highest level of battle I get to play in this year.
Why shouldn't I want to participate in it?"
The Nationals have still not announced their starting pitcher for Sunday, but should apparently be able to take Scherzer pitche in such a situation.
Sherzser, in which case the starting pitcher for the 34th time, had a noisy session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has this season won 18 games and lost 7, with an ERA of 2,53 and 300 barouts of 220 2/3 rounds.
Trump People's Assembly in West Virginia
The president referred a dispute to the situation around the Supreme Court, which was named Brett Kavanaugh, while he talked about the importance of the republicans voting at the inter-elections.
“What we have done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not a participant, but I'm a participant, and that's why I travel around fighting for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued 'You see this cruel, cruel group of radical democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take power back at any cost.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to overrun to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
The democrats, he said, aim to 'to resist and prevent'.
“And you see it over the last four days,” he said, and called the democrats “sin and bad and nasty and dishonest and dishonest”.
He referred to the Senate Court Committee and mentioned the democratic senator, Diane Feinstein, named, where the audience bowed loudly.
‘Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Um, um, um.
No, no, I'm waiting for one – it was very poor body language – the worst body language I've ever seen.”
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They don't tolerate people who say what they're saying.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly enough a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a wide range of Labour Members who have been told that we are not welcome, just because we say what we mean.
My colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was to be censored because I did not agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policies, concerning national security, concerning Europe, ironically similar issues to which they disagreed with previous leaders.
At the notice of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it stated that ‘we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive’.
For most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday evenings have been just this.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the mood of many meetings, and the promise of 'softer, more friendly' politics is too far forgotten, if it ever began.
It becomes increasingly apparent that different opinions are not allowed in the working party, and all opinions are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to party management.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues I once thought that I shared many political positions with all of a sudden began to expect me to take a U-turn and stand for opinions I had never agreed on before, they agreed on the security of the nation or the EU's internal market.
When I speak publicly – and it has nothing to say what I say – I receive a lot of ugly messages on social media that require me to be dismissed, condemns the center policy and tells me that I should not be in Labour.
And it's not just me who's experienced this.
I know that I'm more fortunate than any of my colleagues, because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they meet a sea that gender-discriminatory and racist comments every day, but never get laid.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how rough dilation has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the workers' party should promote an tolerance culture.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to all, and every motion of censure and every change in the electoral rules, the party becomes narrower.
I have received many advice in the last two years when I am encouraged to keep my head low and not raise your voice so much, because it will "make everything better".
But that's not why I was involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which had led to my classroom at the public school I went to was literally fallen, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, both as local councillor and Minister of Government.
I have never hidden my political opinions, nor at previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East can in any way misunderstand my political views or disagreements with current management.
To those who made the proposal for a representative on Friday, I would just like to say that as the country rages our way towards a Brexit who will harm individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot grasp and grasp the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to communicate isn't for Nottingham Momentum -- it's for those I represent, whether they're Labour Members or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of removal or political compromise will prevent me from doing what I think best protects their interests.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Unbeseired Ayr rises to tops
Two late attempts have changed the final result a little, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to sail in this amazing entertaining Tennent's Premiery fight.
They're now at the top of the table, and they're the only ones undefeated by the ten.
Finally, there was as much of their superior defense as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities they were given that led to the home team losing the victory, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be satisfied.
"We have been challenged in our battles so far and are still unsightly, so I must be satisfied with that," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "All honor to Ayr, they were better at making use of the possibilities than we were."
Grant Anderson's trial for 14 minutes, with a target park from Frazier Climo gave Ayr management, but a yellow card to Scotland's founder Rory Hughes, loaned from Warriors, let Melrose balance the position, and Jason Baggot performed a test without a target park.
Climo strengthened Ayr’s leadership by means of a penalty park before, just before he paused, scored and the target park a solo attempt to change his position to 17–5 on break.
But Melrose started the second half strong, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, with the target park from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This was a longer stay in connection with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried out on the stretcher, and from the restart, Ayr increased management even more ed an attempt from Stafford McDowell, with a target park from Climo.
Ayrs operating captain, Blain Macpherson, then got yellow card and Melrose used it to have an extra man on the track to the fullest with a try from Bruce Colvine without a target, at the end of a period of high pressure.
The home team, however, came back strongly, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to have dealt with Climo when he did not have the ball, MacPherson performed a touchdown by instigating behind the protruding Ayr Maulen.
Climo performed a target park, so he did again almost entirely from the restart, after Kyle Rowe obtained David Armstrong's boxing park and sent the flanker Gregor Henry off for the home team's fifth attempt.
Still Game star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that the Still Game star Ford Kieran is on his way into the serving industry – it was recently discovered that he was named as director of a restaurant company with shank appropriations.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC program, which he writes the script for and plays with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
You have announced that the coming ninth season will be the last series, and it seems that Kiernan is now planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is Director of Akontorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun hint that Kiernan wanted to involve himself in Glasgow's 'living restaurant business'.
«Havet is ours»: Bolivia, a country without coastline, hope the court will open the way to the Pacific
Seamen patrol a riggins - covered marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazonas are decorated with the motto: "We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
The whole country of Bolivia has still been reminiscent of the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 1800s, and it is longing for once again to sail in the Pacific.
These openings may be larger than they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits a hearing from the International Court on 1 October after five years of discussion.
‘Bolivia has a driving force, a spirit of Community and serenity, and, of course, awaits the outcome with a positive attitude,’ said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the International Court of Justice ruling on large-scale screens in many different parts of the country, hoping that the Hague Court will give its opinion in favor of Bolivia's allegation that Chile – after several decades of occasional negotiations – is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia its own discharge to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charistian native president, who is facing a controversial re-election campaign next year, has also invested much on Monday’s confession.
“We are very near a return to the Pacific”, he promised late August.
But some analysts believe that the court would hardly take Bolivia's party, and that very little would change if it had.
The UN body, as a member of the Netherlands, has no authority to allow them to give away Chilean land areas and has stifled that it will not decide on the outcome of any negotiations.
According to Paz Zárate, according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert under international law, the hearing of the International Court of Justice only comes six months after the last arguments were heard.
And rather than promoting Bolivia's cause, the last four years could actually have made things worse.
‘The problem of sea access has been decapitated by the current Bolivian administration’, Zárate said.
She believes that Morales' antagonistic rhetoric has taken away any remaining goodwill on Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian representative of The Hague, rejected the theory that the Court's ruling came uncommonly quickly.
According to him, on Monday Bolivia will provide ‘an extraordinary opportunity to open up a new generation relationship with Chile’ and the possibility to ‘put an end to 139 years of disagreement, for the benefit of both parties’.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — has used the maritime situation as a political quake.
‘Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific,’ he added.
"The feeling is an opportunity to see what we have to do to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless they can trust the United States
The North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never disarm its nuclear weapons if they can't trust US authorities.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He encouraged the United States to respect the promises they gave during a meeting between the leaders of the two conflicting countries in Singapore.
These comments come at the same time as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be ready to initiate the fast-lock nuclear diplomat more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a ‘want dream’ that continued sanctions and American resistance against are statements that end the Korean War will ever force North Korea into their knees.
The US authorities are sceptical about accepting the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want a second meeting.
But there are widespread doubts as to whether Pyongyang really has plans to release an arsenal country probably looks like the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo has plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest in huge headgear, which is heading for a clothing store near you
If you want any major additions to the hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you don't have to search anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne deduced a selection of strange, oversized headgear as part of their SS19 collision on the catwalk, which impressed the moths of the moteuka in Paris.
Very unpractical hats have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
Valentino's most imaginative garment was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a spring-like wide breast that drowned the heads of models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a wizard hat or even an pineapple, but they are not designed to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also turned off a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful worms had replanted lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the last scream.
One creation memory of diving equipment, including snorkels and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream in biscuits.
And if you're looking for even more large fashion accessories, then you're lucky.
Style experts predict that the huge hats can be heading for a clothing store near you.
The oversized hats come straight into the heels of ‘La Bomba’, the straw hat with a half-meter-wide brake that has been seen on everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the very unpractical hat that dominated social media has now sent yet another great creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw that is almost as large as the swimsuit model that carries it.
The orange electrofia movement, which is bordered with electro-fictions and completed with a white handle of leather, was the most eye-catching creation in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collision at the moteuka in Paris.
Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the clothing stores next summer – when the designer has had such a great impact it will be difficult to overlook the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are crucial for world citizens
Scotland’s free schools continue to display academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another year’s excellent examination results, supported by individual and joint success in sport, art, music and other social activities.
These schools, which are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, have more than 30 000 students all over Scotland, and work hard to deliver the very best school experience to both students and parents.
Schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as citizens of the world.
As a educational institution that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and requested electoral course in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, when the words of his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we can not just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the year's examination results, we see that language is at the top of the table with the highest pass rates from colleges.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received the examination report A.
The data obtained from the 74 member schools of the Board of Education showed that 72 per cent of students received the exam A in mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French, and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also received A.
This illustrates that schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a decisive skill for children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as a choice is now valued at the same level as in the real world as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curriculum for schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that, on the grounds that employers reported problems in occupying a job vacancy, 17 per cent could be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly important to clarify young people for a future career.
As more and more jobs require language skills, these skills become crucial in a globalised world.
If you have learned a second language, these lifelong skills will bring real benefits in the future, regardless of your career.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov study of more than 4000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a two-digit number of participants (15 percent) could talk.
This is why investment in language training is now crucial for today's children.
The ability of multiple languages, especially those related to emerging economies, will provide children with better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland, if each school teaches in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach in the languages considered to be the most valuable for the United Kingdom on the road towards 2020, e.g. mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever interests your child, there will always be a selection of languages to choose from in colleges, with teachers who are experts in this field.
Scottish schooling aims to create a learning environment that will prepare the children and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, regardless of what the future brings.
Today’s global business environment cannot deny that language is still crucial for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should, in fact, be considered as ‘international communication capability’.
Schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut been le faire.

LeBron will have his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost against fans who want to watch LeBron James play for Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
The Lakers Coach Luke Walton announced that James will be playing in Sunday's presong opening game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he should play is still not settled.
‘There will be more than one and less than 48,’ said Walton on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for Lakers' six-game presong plan.
"I don't need presong matches at this stage of my career," he answered.
Time of the Trump people meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President starts a series of election meetings tonight Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of Trump's five planned crowds in the next week, including stops in cities where he has a lot of support, like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote for his chosen Supreme Court candidate is suspended, Trump aims to obtain support for the upcoming inter-elections, since the Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when the voters go to the polls in November.
When is Trump's Western Virginia meeting tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, Vest-Virginia is scheduled to start at 7 p.m. E.M. this evening, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's Western Virginia People's Meeting online via YouTube live streaming.
Trump is likely to discuss the weekly hearings for the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh, who is charged with sexual abuse.
The main objective of all these meetings is to support Republicans who are facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump has therefore said that in the next few weeks these five peoples have the aim of ‘inculcating volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives’, according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial to his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible as we move towards a busy campaign season," Reuters heard of a campaigner for Trump who did not want to be named.
The evening meeting, which is scheduled to take place at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, may attract supporters from ‘Ohio and Pennsylvania, and covered by the Pittsburgh press’, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month Trump visited West Virginia, a state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisy, who is behind the polls.
“It’s a good sign for Morrisy that the president has come to try to give him a lift on his polls,” said Simon Hader, an expert in political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows the spirit of struggle to maintain faith as they enter Sunday's single game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes could have been exactly what this year's Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of the Momentum is a fully-advised sport concept, yet something that players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
And where do they think the momentum is now?
'They led with six points and now there's four, so we'll carry it with us as a little momentum,' said Jordan Spieth when he left the track for the day.
Of course, Europe will have the advantage – they lead with four points and it is 12 again to play for.
But as Spieth says, Americans feel that they've got some wind in the sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and both have three points of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent games from tea to green, and manager by example.
The deep cowards were getting higher as his round continued, and sank to a decisive Putting to raise the game to a draw as he and Thomas lay two below after two.
His putting, which won them the match of 15, was met with a similar scream – of the sort that shows that he still does not believe that the American team is chanceless.
'We really just have to put all the cloths to and focus on our own game,' said Spieth.
That's all each of these players have now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have got more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who doubtless is Ryder Cup's big success story.
Europe's unusual but lovely couples have four out of four and don't put a foot wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who ungeeked a booky Saturday afternoon, and ungeeked also booky's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the lively crowd make it clear that they are Sunday's greatest competitors, and there are no other players in the audience either will see safe a European victory as the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
All of them preferably both at the same time, in each of their holes.
However, it is too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson hammered up easily with Sergio Garcia, the morning fourballs-helt, when he was partner with Alex Noren.
After one booky and two doubles during the first nine holes, the Spanjolen and the Swedish were so far behind that they did not have nubbesjans to take back the advance.
But on Sunday there's no help to get.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to look closely at because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can turn in a moment.
Europe has played better as layers so far, and lies far ahead of the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that Team United States has the struggle spirit some, especially in the United States, missed.
Europe heads 10-6 at the beginning of the last day in Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong advance at the start of Ryder Cup's last day, after completing Sunday's foursomes and foursomes games with 10-6 leadership against the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led along with two sailors towards a broken Tiger Woods, and raised their score for Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bjørn's European side, fighting to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's unfortunate side in the morning's fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The United States gave more resistance in foursomes and won two matches, but they did not get any of the advance.
Jim Furyk's side must score eight points from Sunday's 12 single game in order to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European Rooki to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari – who together have got the nickname ‘Molliwood’ after a sensational weekend – is the only couple to score four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup's history.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball they seamlessly cooperated to break down Woods and the American Rooki Bryson Dechambeau with even more repressible 5/4.
Woods, who sank through two games on Saturday, grinned in between, but has now lost 19 of their 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in foursomes and performed a 2&1 owner against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who is ranked as number one and three worldwide.
But Europe did not get all the way they wanted on this warm day with light pancreas southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won Majors three times, set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard fight from 2/1-owner over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and came back later to beat the Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4/3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Just twice in Ryder Cup's story, a team has managed to pick up after a four-point advance at the start of the single game, but as current holders, only Furyk's side needs to achieve a draw in order to keep the trophy.
But after being second best for two days, it does not seem that they will be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea will ‘in no way’ agree to unilateral disarmament without trust
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthened distrust against the United States, and that in no way will it agree to unilaterally release its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's annual General Assembly that North Korea has carried out ‘substantial goodwill measures’ in the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the atomic test area and laws not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We have not, however, seen a similar response from the United States,” he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will under no circumstances unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints on Washington's resistance to a gradual nuclear disarmament, where North Korea is rewarded for gradual downturning steps, but his statement was significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang has done earlier.
Mr Ri referred to a joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on 12 June, at the very first meeting between a seated President of the United States and a North Korean leader, where Kim promised to work against the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula, while Mr Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the Korean war, which lasted from 1950–53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first release its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the challenge of reducing strict international sanctions against North Korea.
‘The United States insists on ‘nuclear disarmament first’ and raises pressure via sanctions to achieve its objective by coercion, and even opposes the ‘declaration of the end of war’, according to Ri.
"The belief that sanctions can force us in the knees is a wish dream for people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions create further mistrust."
It did not mention the plans for a second match between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed in front of the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae in the last five months, adding: "If the other party in this disarmament case were South Korea, rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have been locked as fast as it is."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack against mainland US with North Korea's rockets was inevitable after ‘Mr. Ande President’ Trump called Kim a ‘rockettmann’ on a suicide mission.
After threatening to “completely destroy” by North Korea last year, Trump stood this year in front of the UN and praised Kim for being brave enough to take the disarmament steps, but said that much work remains, and the penalties have to remain in force until North Korea is nuclear-destructed.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he didn't have a timeframe for this, and said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary for Foreign Affairs Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that 'the Security Council's sanctions still need to be enforced vigorously and without exception, until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament'.
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to choke the funding of Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile weapons program.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He went from Pyongyang in July and said that they had progressed, but only hours after charged North Korea to him for coming with "godly demands".
North Korea committed itself in a meeting with Moon this month to putting down a missile area and a nuclear weapon facility if the United States did ‘equal action’.
He said Kim had said that these 'equal measures' he wants, the security guarantees Trump was promised in Singapore and measures to normalize the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard take a course in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will help students to get more sleep by tackling the growing unculture of pudding through the night with caffeine inks as fuel.
An academic found out that the students at the world's best university often didn't have any idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He started the course after he gave a talk about the impact of sleep shortages on learning.
"After the talk, a girl came away to me and said, "Why hasn't anyone said this before?"
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and it surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains the importance of good sleep habits in the performance of academics and sports, and in general.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and adm. dir. for the university's health care, said that the university decided to start the course after they saw that the students suffered from a serious lack of sleep.
The course, which lasts for one hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a room in a dormitory, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, jogs and books and hear about the effects of caffeine and light and how sporting performance is affected by sleep shortages, and how important is a sleep routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons makes participants think about their own daily routine.
‘We are aware that this is not going to change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know about this, just as you have the right to know about the risks of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
There's still some pride in being able to puke all night, he said, and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure on the students led to that sleep shortage being an increasing problem.
Some and good sleep should be the students' 'secret weapons' against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even as a means of weight gain, as sleep shortage puts the brain in starvation mode, leading to a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course, he took one of the classes to the professor last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course inspired him to work for a course that was available for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all the students to take a similar study program before they are enrolled in the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students put an alarm on when they were to lie down as well as when they were to stand up, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic monitors and LED lights.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Goals of Menga beat out Gerrards men
Rangers probably suffered a loss when Dolly Menga's target hit Steven Gerrard's team 1-0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox page wanted to get its first victory since February 4-1 on St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss on 18 fights as manager and left since his eight points from Ladbrokes Premiere leaders Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before the break, and Rangers could never cancel.
Rangers now fall into the sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to the third and is behind Hibernian on target difference.
There may be more trouble in the yeasts of Rangers after the Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was thrown from away.
Gerrard made eight preys on the team, which swept past Ayr and into the Betfred Cup-semfinals.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been glad how his well-interested team struck the opponents.
Rangers might have the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should have scored only two minutes into the fight when Menga's first passport sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle player lost the chance.
A long free kick by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Hallkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot at the pole.
Rangers took control, but it looked as if their game leaned more on hope than belief in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have a penalty park after a quarter, when he and Steven Lawless crashed, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected this.
Rangers could only two shots on target in the first place, but earlier Ibrox goalie Liam Kelly didn't get any trouble with the Lassana Coolibalys head and a tame kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livis' opening for 34 minutes may have been against the game's course, no one can deny that they deserved it for the stress.
Again, Rangers were unable to handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cold when he chose Menga for a simple termination.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent in the pause, and the switch gave immediate results when the wing player sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get the gamblers to play exactly the type of fight they like, with Lithgow and Hallowet caught up long dance after long dance.
Holt's side could have stretched management last time, but McGregor stood up against Jacobs before Lithgow's head from the corner.
Rangers' exchanger Glenn Middleton probably had a late demand for a penalty park when he got into conflict with Jacobs, but once again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Inventor of the geigerteller
And now a page from the "Sunday Morning" calendar: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the device we know today as the geiger counter.
The geigerteller has been an important part of science since then, and also became part of popular culture via the film ‘Bells of Coronado’ from 1950, with the scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What on earth is it?"
Rogers: ‘It is a geiger counter. It finds radioactive minerals as uranium.
When you turn on these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals emits.”
Evans: "Shall make a sound now!"
His Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the invention he gave names to, lives on.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory
Cells can reach ‘see’ a protein that is common in many cancers, and then inject again into the patient.
A vaccine during testing has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was given the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, experienced that the ovary she suffered from fainting for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2, typically for many cancers, and then these cells are injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘driver growth of different cancers’, including breast cancer, ovaries, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure, whereby immune cells were taken from the patient and ‘trained’ to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.

It didn't go well
Kanye West was arched in studio on Saturday Night Live after a falsifying act in which he praised the American president Donald Trump and said he would make elections in 2020.
After making his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he went out against the democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
"It happens so often that I talk to a white person, and then he says, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
If I was afraid of racism, I had moved from the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fools of Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judicial Committee on the accusations of sexual abuse that Christine Blasey Ford presented.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West was uploaded in social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock wanted to ridicule West by posting the recording.
West also complained to the audience that he heard it in the back room about the choice of the headgear.
"They bullied me.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They bullied me!
And then they said I don't understand what the reality is," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see that I understand what the reality is?" he said, and said, "Take on me the Supermann coat, because then no one can say what I'm going to do.
Try love."
His comments were posted at least twice, and the employees who worked at the SNL looked flaued out, reported Variaty, where a staff member told me, "The entire studio was dead."
West was brought in as the last little replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, when her girlfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he presented the song “I Love It” dressed as a Perrier-water bottle.
West was supported by the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of our bravest: TAKE TO CALL THE MASSES."
But talkshow host Karen Hunter twitted that West is just "he's who he is and it's absolutely amazing".
"But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art') which I believe is growing and asking out ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
We are also," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name.
He is not the first artist who changes his name and now follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rappercollege Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion, and of course it is the deceased musical Prince, who changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Visibility of the killing test after stabbing at the restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been tried to kill after a man was stabbed at a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackmore, according to the police.
The sights are expected to be presented to the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The mission will be reviewed by the Public Process Service.
Game of Thrones-star Kit Harington protrudes "gify masculinity"
Kit Harington is known from the role of sword swinger Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone out and criticized the stereotype of the machohelten and says such roles on film often make young men think they must be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that something has gone wrong and wondered how to tackle the problem of "toxic masculinity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones-college Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that he was very concerned with the theme.
‘It worries me quite a lot at present — where did it go wrong with masculineity?’ he said.
‘How have we raised men in view of the problems we see now?’
Kit believes that TV can have part of the blame for the increase in "toxic masculinity" due to the strong masculinic roles.
He went on to say, "What's innate and what's your business?
What is communicated on the TV and on the street, what makes young guys feel like they have to grow just this side by being a man?
I think it's one of the really big questions today – how can we change that?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.”
In the interview he also admits that he will not make any progress or successor of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and says he is ‘completed with battlefields and horses’.
From November Kit will play the leading role in a new recording by Sam Shepard True West. This is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a runner.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife during the recordings, so that way something good came out of it — my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, in which Kit's role figure Jon Snow is in love, in the Emmy-priced fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of up to 14 % in HIV and AIDS living population.
More than 820,000 people are hit in the country, says the health representative.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The large majority of new cases have been transmitted via sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China by transmission of blood.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way is now nearing zero, Chinese health professionals said at a conference in the Yunnan province.
However, year by year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100000.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT individuals is said to be high.
Because of its conservative values, studies have estimated that 70–90 % of men having sex with men eventually marry women.
Much of the disease infection is due to insufficient protection in these circumstances.
Since 2003, the Chinese authorities have promised general access to HIV medicine as part of a response to the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects the use of leaked data on Republican Senators, the use of "hazardous lies" and "conspirator theories"
A member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, rejected Saturday charges that members of her staff had posted personal data to three Republican Senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lawmakers.
The democracy of Los Angeles insured by the allegations was made by 'ultraconservative' commentators and web pages.
«Liegers, liars and more repugnant liars», said Waters in an opinion on Twitter.
The published information covered the reported home addresses and telephone numbers of the US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate about the assault charges against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came a little after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative web pages, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was tracked to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of Waters' staff, according to Hill.
‘This unfounded accusation is completely incorrect and a legal lie’, continued Waters.
"The members of my staff - who have received their identities, personal data and security compromised as a result of these unruly and false accusations - had absolutely no responsibility for the leakage of this information.
This unjustified accusation is completely incorrect and a legal lie".
Waters' statement was quickly criticised online, among other things by former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This is aggressive," said Fleischer.
‘This indicates that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When accused of something they have not done, they must not be aggressive.
Don't let them go to defense.
You mustn't doubt the motives of the prosecutor.
They have to act calmly and understand.”
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing aggressively during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who works to remove Waters in the intermediates, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
"Large - if true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had notified ‘relevant authorities and police about these false accusations’.
‘We will ensure that perpetrators are revealed’, she continued ‘and that they are held responsible for all actions that are destructive and dangerous to each of my staff’.
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again – blood-fat Rowan Atkinson in spy parody
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit features in all new movies with a British sloppy and it seems to be relevant for this resuscitation of the parodifranchise Johnny English action comedy – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and resumed in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic self-esteem on how obviously hopeless we are to become the nation's new export product?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his gleaming eyes and the rubber face has been renewed its license to rotate it for the second time – his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comic figure intended for territories with non-English-speaking Chinese republics.
Of course, he's the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a dead Mr Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes with one single note in the music of a fire car theme under the opening ceremony at the Olympics in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the role of Atkinson played in the too long forgotten TV ads of Barclaycard; the traveling and international mystery man who leaves behind chaos everywhere.
It's one great moment in the latest Johnny English career.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades snowed his helmet.
The talent of the Atkinson for physical comedy comes to its right, but the humor feels quite bloody and strangely redundant, especially now as the “serosive” brands like 007 and the Mission Impossible willing away have the element of comedy.
The grandmother seems to be more focused on children than adults, and to me Johnny English's father is not as inventive and spewed as the stub film loops in Mr Bean.
The current point is that the United Kingdom is in serious problems.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the United Kingdom's super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all the British agents in the field, to the dismay of the guarded agent – a regrettable little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop for a Prime Minister, a pompous and depressed figure that is already undergoing a complete crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does a very good job with this like-Teresa-May role, but the script doesn't give her much to work on.
Her intelligence counselors informed that since every active spy has been revealed, she must collect some of the retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now works at a snob-bet establishment, but gives unofficial instruction in secret intelligence, there are some polite sequences here, when English offers a rocky Academy for spying activity.
English is being taken back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with his old, troubled helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, spliced with a submarine commander, a hysterical upper-class lady role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So the Batman and Robin style of messing up everything on behalf of the Queen are back, where they confront with Olga Kurylenko's fantastic femme fatal, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is being seduced by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve the United Kingdom's cyber-problems: the pathetic Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start the journey with a dangerous side-line: disguised as waiters put the guy at a prying French restaurant. They create chaos while hiding on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English triggers pure anarchy as he tries to use a VR headset to make himself known at Volta's house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but even so lovable and noisy there is so much reminiscent of children's TV with the whole thing.
Quite mediocre, all of it.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really has to use his talent?
Labour claims that they plan to let the British work four days' week, but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party will consider a radical plan that will give the British four days' work week – but get paid for five.
The lot is likely that business leaders will use savings on the revolution with artificial intelligence by giving workers an additional day off.
This will result in employees receiving a three-day weekend, while receiving the same salary.
Sources say that the idea fits into the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favor of workers.
Trade unions support the transition to four-day week so that employees can also benefit from the benefits of the new economy.
A senior source in the Labour party told The Sunday Times: "A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
‘It will not happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition that fits the party’s desire to make the pendulum turn to the benefit of the workers – in addition to the party’s overall industrial strategy’.
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. Green Party promised four days' week during the campaign before the parliamentary elections in 2017.
However, the idea is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for Labour said, "A four-day week is not the policy of the party, and is not something that is being assessed by the party."
The Finance Speaker of Labour, John McDonnell, used the Labour Conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless directors” and “professors” of public service providers.
The shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies are in danger of not recovering the entire holding because a Labour government can make ‘deducts’ from perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in corporate boards and to set up employee funds to transfer 10% of equity to private sector companies to employees who can receive an annual dividend of £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell me "60 Minutes" about the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh can make them change their mind.
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has given a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the Agency's findings may cause some Republican Senators to change their sight.
In an interview that was sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about the FBI to find out something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy put himself more open to it than the colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
‘I said at the beginning of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, ludicrous, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be cut in stone.
"I've decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and in that case it had to be an inquisitive discovery," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it energeticly," added Graham and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
‘And none of them she mentioned could not confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything new will change that."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it helped to combat poverty?
This Saturday is New York hosting the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive list of stars to act and an equally impressive mission; eradicated the world's poverty.
Global Citizen Festival, which is now in its seventh year, will make thousands of people flow to the big lawn in Central Park, not only to experience sizes like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the event's real goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to combat poverty by making more people work actively against poverty.
In order to get free tickets to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks, or "actions", such as voluntary work, send an e-mail to a world leader, take a phone or in other meaningful ways to raise awareness of their objective of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when it's only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to get people to fight for change, or just a case of so-called ‘pressivism’ - that people feel great by signing a signature campaign online or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, they have registered more than 19 million ‘actions’ from the trailers, with a well of different goals.
They say that these actions have helped to make world leaders declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than 37 billion dollars that will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group could refer to 390 exposures and announcements due to their actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funding has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main exposures are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and entrepreneurs based in the United Kingdom to help children exploit their full potential, and promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4700 tweeter from Global Citizens.
‘With the support of the British government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice with malnutrition into a footnote in history’, Ambassador for Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 interventions in the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition measures.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, ‘what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?’
The Global Citizen replied: "There will be a long and difficult way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the important citizens' rights and the anti-Aparteid movements ahead of us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who appear at this year's event in New York, which will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use the Navy as a ‘blocked’ to prevent Russian energy exports - the Minister for the Interior
Washington can ‘if necessary’ resort to the Navy in order to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, to reveal to the US Minister for the Interior, Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially when operating after the invitation of the legal government — is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flag of Europe", he said.
And according to the spokesperson, there's always ways and means of dealing with this.
‘The United States, through the Navy, has the opportunity to ensure that the sea routes are open and, if necessary, block to ensure that the energy does not reach the market’, he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation that profiles itself as the ‘energy consumers’ voice’ in the United States.
He compared Washington's ways of interacting with Russia and Iran, and remarked that they are far on the way.
‘The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel’, he said and referred to Russia as ‘one trick pony’ with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The opinions came after the Trump administration has been on a tour to strengthen the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe.
Staff in the Trump administration, including the President himself, therefore tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the ‘inappropriate’ project The North European gas pipeline 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the ‘capture’ of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North European gas pipeline is worth 11 billion dollars, which is going to double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's glowing resistance to the project is motivated only for economic reasons and is an example of unruly competition.
‘I think we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose supplier,’ said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the US Energy Minister Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The US position has met with resistance from Germany, which has reconfirmed its commitments in the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to stay away from the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have major problems with third countries that interfere with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of BDI after a recent meeting between the German chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be "thinking seriously" on his Presidential Candidacy for 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "think seriously" about whether she would stand as a presidential candidate after the inter-elections.
During a election meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she will be quiet.
"It's time for women to get to Washington and fix the shaken government, and it includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I would like to think seriously about whether or not to be a presidential candidate."
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during his election meeting and said that he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm worried all the way to the margin of what Donald Trump does with democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren's own voters do not think she should be silent in 2020.
58 % of the 'probable' voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be silent, according to a poll by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidacy.
The poll showed higher support for former Governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidacy and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in the context of a possible candidacy in 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially by January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin points out Track Palin's PTSD during Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after working in Sept.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence on Monday night
"What my son goes through, what he goes through after coming home, I have in common with other families who experience the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability of our soldiers," she told the audience at a election event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest “the elephant in the room” and said of the son and other war veterans: “They come home a little changed, they come home hardened, they come home and wonder if this is the respect for what their soldier comrades and pilots and all the other members of the military have contributed to the country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was targeted for domestic violence on a woman, clumsy with a home violence report and possession of a weapon while he was intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the police in Wasilla.
18 States and D.C. support the testing of new asylum policies
Attitudes and District of Columbia support a legal test of a new policy in the United States refusing asylum to victims of gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 Länder and D.C. provide information from amicus curiae (friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, reported NBC News.
The whole name of the defendant in Grace v. Sessions case that American Civil Liberties Union took in August against the federal police has not been published.
She claimed that the partner “and his violent gang member sons” abused her, but officials in the United States refused her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, such as the United Nations, which has radical problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a decision in 2014 by the appeal court for immigrants who gave undocumented immigrants who fled from domestic violence the right to apply for asylum.
State attorney Karl Racine, District of Columbia, said in his statement on Friday that the new policy “is missing from many decades of state, federal and international law”.
«Feederal law requires all asylum requirements to be determined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the requirement and such prohibition is contrary to that principle», said the briefing of amicus curiae.
Lawyers further argued in their information that policies that refused immigration harm the US economy and say that they are highly likely to become entrepreneurs and "helps with the necessary labour force".
Minister of Justice Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer give asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
‘Asyl is available to those leaving their country of origin because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political vision,’ said Sessions in the communication of 11 June on policy.
Asyl was never meant to reduce all problems — even all serious problems — that people face every day around the world.
Disorientated rescue operation in Palu – the death figures are doubled in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
'It was very excited,' said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforts her fever-sick son at an evacuation center in the cramped city of Palu.
"All the time you see ambulances picking up the deaths.
Clean water is defective».
You could see residents who came to ruined homes and lighten through water damaged assets in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, who were injured in the earthquake that had strength of 7.5, were overfilled.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and his shoulder, sits outside the Palus military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing heavy aftertocks.
He gets tears in his eyes when he retelled how it felt when the violent earthquake shaken the hotel room in the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves safely.
I was pinched by the wall that collapsed together, I think,' told Haris to Associated Press, and added that the family was in the city to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of ‘touching’ with ‘propaganda ads’
One week after a public Chinese newspaper ran a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper that painted the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
United States President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the attachment China Daily paid to move into the Des Moines Register – the largest newspaper in Iowa – after accused China of trying to interfere with the US Congress elections on 6 November, an accusation China rejects.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to influence the election in the United States, marked a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China, said US officials according to Reuters.
It is true that foreign authorities use ads to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has led to rounds of new customs duties on each other's imports.
China's criminal charges early in the trade war were to hit export companies in countries such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, reporting Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador in China and former long-term governor in Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reading paper on Sunday Des Moines Register: "China is now stepping up the harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press".
‘By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities exploit the freedom of expression and the open press we enjoy in America to deposit a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register,’ wrote Branstad.
“As a contrast – by the newspaper on the street here in Beijing you don’t find many different opinions and don’t experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese around China’s problematic economic course, given that the media are under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added: "One of China's biggest newspapers rejected the offer to publish" his article, even though he did not inform which newspaper it was.
Republicans scare female voters before the choice of the Kavanaugh Fadsen, warn analysts
As many top politicians among Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been charged with several sexual abuse charges, analysts warn that they will have a counter-reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming local elections.
The feelings around this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already indicated that they want to proceed with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn," said Grant Reeher, a professor of state science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s suggestion of an FBI investigation in the last second would be enough to calm the mind of the voters.
“Women will not forget yesterday’s events – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to the newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators sang ‘November is coming!’ while they demonstrated the times of the Senate when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to explode," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, to the news page.
'People say it's already been high, that's true.
But it could have been higher, especially among female uncertain voters in the suburbs and younger voters between 18 and 29 years of age, who often do not vote even if they dislike the President."
Even before Ford's public testimony that gave a detailed description of the charges for sexual abuse against the highest court candidate, analysts believed that it would be a counter-reaction if Republicans forced through the appointment.
"This has become a bad root of the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former President of the RNC (Republican National Committee), early last week, according to NBC News.
‘It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final approval or whether Kavanaugh is inserted – it’s also about the way the Republicans have handled this and how they have dealt with it,’ pointed out Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities United States, a group promoting the election of democratic candidates, to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided over who they should believe in in the wake of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, by a small majority in favour of the latter.
A new inquiry from YouGov shows that 41 % of the respondents were fully or quite convinced of Ford's testimony, while 35 % said they were fully or quite convinced of Kavanaugh's manufacture.
In addition, 38 % said that they were quite or completely convinced that Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, while only 30 % said the same thing about Ford.
After the Flake output, the FBI is investigating the claims made by Ford in addition to at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford explained to the Senate Justice Committee last week that Kavanaugh was intoxicating her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed his geniuses to her while at a party during the study time at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web author plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the author of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology expert, Inrupt, is a company building on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have access to it.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee spewed that the purpose is “world domination”.
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up.
‘It is an historic moment’.
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own ‘personal online repository’ or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
The unique feature of the online personal repository is that it is up to the user who should have access to that type of information.
The company calls it ‘personal authentication through data’.
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind the Inrupt is that the company should provide resources, process and relevant competence to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers on contract to work on the project and a bunch of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google that they should introduce something completely new or not, which will make their business models completely circumcised overnight.

Bernard Water: Feiring of Victoria Cross receiver from World War I
The only priest in the Church of England who was awarded a Victoria cross during World War I as a fighter was swept out in his hometown after 100 years.
Colonel Lieutenant and priest Bernard Water was awarded the honour of 29 September 1918 at the battle in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a shooter four days later and was never told that he was awarded the highest British military award.
A memorial stone was discovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Water, said it was a "flat symbolics" in that the stone should be revealed exactly 100 years after the grandfather's award-winning break.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Water led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September – “through a lot of thick mist and under heavy fire from field cannons and machine guns”.
Later he crashed towards the line of fire and led the line of "great courage" in the future before storming a field cannon self-centered and beating out three of the departments.
Lieutenant Colonel Water was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just one month before the war was over.
Michael Van, 72, said that the grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but something that makes me humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Water also laid down a crane after the parade, which was led by the corps Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vand said, "I felt very honored to play a role in the parade," and added, "the sanctity of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people".
MMA trailers were up all night to watch the Bellator 206 martial arts program, instead they got Peppa pig
Imagine you've been up all night watching the densely packed Bellator 206, just to find out that you can't see the main game.
The participant from San Jose got through 13 matches, including six on the card and was shown directly through night in Great Britain at Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the viewers in the United Kingdom were sitting to stagger as the photo suddenly showed Peppa's pig.
Some were less impressed after keeping awake until early morning to see the fight.
A trailer described on Twitter the transition to the children's program as ‘a kind of sick joke’.
“It’s government regulation that it’s not appropriate to send such programs at 6:00, so they had to turn to children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior Vice President for Marketing and Communication, when he was asked about the shipment.
‘Peep pig, yes!’.
Bellator's CEO, Scott Coker, said they're going to work on the broadcast plan to include the viewers in Storbrtannia in the future.
"I think we can figure it out for the rematch," said Coker.
"But it is at 6:00 in the morning on Sunday there, and we will not be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe with--as we switched over, there were many messages going back and forth, and they weren't exactly of the friendly kind.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't, it was an authority tree.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We want to reduce from six to five games – which we usually send – and we tried to extend far for the trailers, but tipped over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt less of a sexuality
The Olympic stupper Tom Daley says he grew up with a feeling of amnesty toward everyone because of his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn't until high school he realized that "he wasn't like others".
In the first program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he stood up for the homophiles' rights to give other “hop”.
He also said that becoming a parent made that he cares less about winning OL.
The usual programme manager of the traditional programme, Kirsty Young, shall be gone for a few months because of illness.
Daley was a little lost on Laverne's first transmission and said he felt "less worth" than everyone else he grew up with because "it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls".
He said, "To this day, it's these feelings of being minor and different that have been the real motivation and have me the power and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "was something," he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is twice a bronze winner in the Olympics and has become a highly profiled LGBT ambassador, and he used his participation in this year's social partners in Australia to appeal for several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he stands up because he feels lucky that he can live open without any negative consequences and wants to give others hope.
The three times world champion said that he fell in love with a man -- filmmaker Dustin Lance Black from the United States, who he met in 2013 -- "Covered me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you undergo so much at such a young age" -- he attended his first OL when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Dalley, and Daley said his whole perspective had changed.
"If you'd asked me last year, everything was all about me having to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there's bigger things than the gold medal in the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had obtained tickets for London in 2012 – since he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't live long enough to sit on the first row," he said.
"I kept his hands when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in Olympics in 2012 and won the bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – to stoop in front of a home republic under the Olympics, the best feeling ever," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection – Proud of Heather Small – which meant a lot to him in the drive-up before the Olympics and which still gives him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs goes on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Formvåge Mikkelson took out for the Ryder Cup golf tournament on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday when he plays his 47. Ryder Cup game, but he has to get in shape if it's not going to be a sad milestone.
Mikkelson, who plays in the biennial for impressive the 12th time, was put on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk before Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being in the center of events, as he had so often been to the United States, the five times major-winner divides the day between being a cheerleader and working with his game on the rank in hopes of correcting what is carving.
The 48-year-old never had the best turn, even at the top of the career and is not in the perfect form of the tight Le Golf National track, where the long rough area still punishes lost blows.
And if the course itself isn't scary enough, Mikkelson meets in the ninth battle on Sunday, the very British Open Master Francesco Molinari, who has joined with the beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their battles this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 single games, get a successful start, the game of Mickelson can prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expresses confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
'He fully understood what role he had today, gave me a pat on his back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready next day' said Furyk.
‘He has great confidence.
He is a Hall of Famer and has added so much to these layers before, and this week.
I don't think I saw him playing two games.
I saw for myself more, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Fallo's record for most played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never fully reached his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 sails, 20 losses and seven drawths, but Furyk said his participation brought some intangible values to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, wise and likes to run fun with others.
"I think the younger players had fun trying against him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives a lot more than just the game.
European Team Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that his great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European Team Captain, knows from experience that significant leadership at the entrance to the last day single game in Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 campaign at Valderrama, where a page led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but the charred to the victory with a minimum margin of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
‘You still remind yourself that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only so far,’ said Bjorn, photographed after seeing the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone else on that team that this isn't over.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus lies.
I have always said that I am focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we are very aware of what is on the other side – the best golfers in the world”.
Bear is very pleased with how his players have made their way to the tough golf course and adds, "I couldn't have done it better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow, it's the individual performances that are at the center, and there's something completely different.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there alone, your performances that golfer tested to the full.
That's the message that you have to communicate to the players, that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave the partner, and he also has to go out and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, the opponent Jim Furyk will try to get his players to deliver better individually than they did as partners.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the big revolutions the last day; he was on the winning team at Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe performed the "mirage at Medinah".
I remember every condemned word of it," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had here with his players at the entrance to the last day.
"We have 12 important battles tomorrow, but you want to get a good start, like the one we experienced at Brookline, which we saw at Medinah.
When the momentum starts to go in one direction, it puts a great deal of pressure on the middle battles.
We then arrange our setup and send out the people in the way we feel, you know, we're trying to create something magical tomorrow.
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the game and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the top half of the game order.
"I bet on this group of men in that order because I think it stands all the way," said Bjorn about his choices of single players.
Germany’s new warships delayed once again
The latest frigate of German navy should have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the days of the Cold War, but it will not happen until the earliest next year due to failed systems and galloping costs, reported local media.
The completion of the ‘Rheinland-Palatinate’, the pilot ship of the brand new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted a military spokesperson.
The ship should have been handed over in 2014, but the major problems after delivery pursued the ambitious project.
The four vessels in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered completely back in 2007 will replace the old frigates in the Bremen class.
It has been agreed that they shall be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-air and anti-ship missiles and some stealth technology, such as radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it would be possible to apply the latest frigates for up to two years away from home.
Still delays, however, mean that the advanced warships – they were said to give Germany strength at sea – will already be out-dated before they are put into service, report Die Zeit.
The fateful F125 Fregatt created headlines last year, when German marine officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the yard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a ship builder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the return, but the German media mentioned a number of important "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless in a battle mission.
The software defects were particularly important since ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are to be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors – only half of the crew of older frigates in the Bremen class.
It was also revealed that the ship has an enormous overweight, which reduces performance and limits the marine's ability to make upgrades in the future.
The 7000-ton tongue "Rheinland-Palatinate" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price label on the entire project – including crew training – has begun to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached an estimated EUR 3.1 billion – from the initial EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems surrounding the new frigates are particularly significant in the light of recent warnings that Germany's marine force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Government’s Defence Committee, confirmed that the Navy actually “is running empty for use ships”.
The official said that the problem has escalated over time because old ships were out of town, but there were no new ships.
He regrets that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the Navy.
National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
New research carried out at a land real estate in the highlands of Scotland shall reveal how bats use the landscape in food hunting.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and contribute to the formulation of future conservation measures.
The study for researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and dwarf bats as well as tannifying and water bats at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activity over the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Experts' audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bats and the species that do what.
A habitat map and a report will then be developed to provide a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, the NTS nature conservation advisor, hopes the results will reveal the most important areas of the habitat for the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will be included in the decision on the measures to be taken, such as the establishment of pasture land and the best way of protecting the forests of bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has sunk considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and works that affect breeding sites and the reduction of habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, the same with fly paper and certain chemically treated building materials as well as attacks from head taxes.
In fact, bats are not blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, they have more use for the ears than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echo location to find insects and obstructions on the road when flying.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten competent experts who regularly carry out studies, monitoring of breeding sites and sometimes rescue work.
The organisation has also established Scotland’s first and only own bats reserve at Threeave Land Property in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bats.
Real estate manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Treave we have a perfect area for bats," he says.
"We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He stresses the importance of mapping the bats before maintenance is carried out on a property since accidental destruction of a single breeding place can kill up to 400 females and young people, and perhaps destroy an entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them or disrupt them or destroy their breeding places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish member of the Bat Conservation Trust team, has encouraged the audience to help work.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species, we just don't know how the populations are doing."
Ronaldo rejects the rape charges while lawyers will sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape charges against him as “false news” and says that people “want fame” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He's accused of paying her $375 000 afterwards for keeping close to the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
When he spoke on a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after the charges were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo rejected the charges as "false news".
‘No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," said five times the winner of the Gold Ball into the camera.
‘They want fame by using my name.
It's common.
They want fame by stating my name, but it is part of the job.
I am a happy man and feel good," adds the football player with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel because of the allegations, which they have called ‘an unacceptable representation of suspicions in the private sphere’, according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that football player will demand compensation for ‘administrative damage to an extent equivalent to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of privacy in recent years’.
The alleged event shall have taken place in June 2009 at a suite in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga must have gone back to the football player's room, where he supposedly should have raped her anal, according to documents submitted to the district court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was “99 % a good person” who was failed by the “one percent”.
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken to the hospital, but later they made settlements outside the court because she was ‘lived for revenge’ and was also concerned about ‘being publicized’.
The 34-year-old she now says she's trying to put the settlement aside because she's still traumatized after the alleged event.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack, and moved this summer to Italian Juventus on a contract worth EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom “will mourn forever” about losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom “will mourn forever” if they lose the status of world leader in car production after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was “disquietingly” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the United Kingdom left the EU without agreement, they would stop production temporarily at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the consequences of delayed border crossing of any Brexit without agreement could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant — producing Toyotas Auris and Avensis — produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the EU.
‘If the United Kingdom leaves the EU at the end of March, I see that production at our factory is halting,’ said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other British producers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without agreement about how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says they'll shut down the Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is whether what car manufacturers say is supply chain risks to any Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s production line is operated on the basis of ‘order as required’ and it arrives at parts every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the United Kingdom and the EU for cars placed on the order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a stay at the border, which the industry says may lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's stock at the Derbyshire factory, said the company, and thus the production will stop.
Clark said that Theresa May's Brexit plan for further relations with the EU is ‘presist designed to avoid such checks at the border’.
"We need to have an agreement, we want to get the best deal that makes us, as I say, not only can we enjoy success at the moment, but we're taking this opportunity," he said on the BBC Radio 4's Today program.
‘The message, not only from Toyota but also other car manufacturers, is that we must certainly be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains’.
Toyota could not say how long production will be stopped but warned that increased costs in the long term will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnston for 24 years and is a trade union leader at the factory, said that members are becoming increasingly concerned: "My experience suggests that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back".
A government spokesperson said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU"
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein might be suspended again, says the White House
Donald Trump's fateful meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein can be “hidden one more week” while the fight around Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, reported the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special adviser Robert Mueller, who examines Russian interference in the elections, relations between Trump assistants and Russia, and possible obstacles to legal practice by the President.
The question of Trump's rejection of the wise justice minister or not, and thus threatening Mueller's independence, has for many months taken place during the speculations in Washington.
Previously this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of taking up talks with Trump and trying to remove the president on the basis of the 25th base law supplement.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that was about to resign voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, which at the time was in the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said "preferably would drop" to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid that it collapsed with the Senate Justice Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who has accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation in one week on charges against Kavanaugh, which further exposed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
On questions about the Rosenstein meeting she said, "A date for the meeting was not fixed. It could be this week, but I realized there could be a week's suspension because of everything that happens to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'm always busy keeping the press up to date."
Some journalists will contest that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Programvert Chris Wallace asked about the cause.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not resentful of TV reporters' "self-deficiency", although she added, "I do not disagree with the fact that they are self-good".
Then she suggested that the contact between Trump and the press will be more frequent.
“The president does more questions than any former presidents,” she said and added without providing evidence: “We have looked at the figures”
There will still be press conferences, said Sanders, but "if the press gets the chance to ask the president of the United States questions directly, it will certainly be better than talking to me.
We're trying to make it happen often, and you've seen that we've done it often in the last few weeks, and it's going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open events or press conferences when visiting important people.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week the president showed the possible cause, when he conducted a solo race and at times had a strange behavior in front of a lot of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland regarding Brexit concerns
The Health Secretary has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS (State Health Service) to express the country’s gratitude and a desire for them to remain behind Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish Member of Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom was to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of applying for a residence and work permit for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: ‘Demotives between the United Kingdom and the EU on posting have taken place throughout the summer and are expected to land on a solution for the harvest.
But the British government has also stepped up the preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I understand that this must be a very difficult time for you all.
I will therefore repeat now how much I value the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and outside, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care work for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly their home and we hope you will be here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes urgent surgery after head injury
The defense player at Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, went through urgent surgery after having suffered a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ reported in Tennessee newspaper.
Tennessee States' main coach, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the damage happened just before the first round was over.
‘He came out on the sideline and like just collapsed there,’ said Reed.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they placed him on a stretcher and took him back for further investigation.
A official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had been operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘there is no information on the type/extent of the damage yet’ and Tennessee State attempts to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transition from Illinois.
He had five ceilings on Saturday before he finished the fight, which gives a total of 18 ceilings for his season.
Foreign purchasers will be charged a higher document fee when purchasing property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when purchasing property in the United Kingdom.
The change will neutralise the success of Corbyn’s plan to attract young voters
The increase in document fees will be collected from those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Experts in the Ministry of Finance expect it to increase up to £120 million a year – to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign purchasers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the United Kingdom – and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be considered as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to attract young people with a commitment to offer more reasonable housing and a framework of high-income groups.
The document fee increase will be imposed on persons and enterprises who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The surplus – which is in addition to the applicable document fee, including the higher rate introduced two years ago on the second dwelling and the rental rental purchase – can be as high as 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to bring up to £120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 % of newly built properties in London are purchased by people who do not live in the United Kingdom.
Many prosperous areas of the country — especially in the capital city — have become ‘scoker cities’ because of the many foreign purchasers who are mostly living outside the country.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson made proposals to reduce the document fee to help more young people own their own home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping the housing prices high by buying up countries without using it, and demanded that Theresa May have to reject allowances for reasonable housing to resolve the United Kingdom's "smear housing policy".
Jeremy Corbyn has announced an interesting series of proposed housing reforms, including rental controls and an end to unjustified drafts.
He also wants to give local governments greater power to build new homes.
May said, "I said last year that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our degraded housing market.
The United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be as simple for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, and also for non-resident companies, to buy dwellings that are too hard for working British citizens.
Too many people have the dream of owning their own dwelling become too distant, and the unworthy situation of the homeless persists».
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland’
The chief of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old shots rejoice over the challenge of reviving the club in the north-east, which currently holds third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
'I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
I got a B-caps and it was,' told Ross to BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
"But I was often with my father and saw Scotland on Hampden as a child, and there is always something that withdraws me.
However, this option would only come if I succeeded in the club management.”
Ross' predecessors like Sunderland Manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not anxious to follow such established names in the big club, and has previously refused approximations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
‘Sustainance for me at present will be measured on whether I can get the club back in the Premier League’.
From the structure and facilities of this club, they undoubtedly belong to the Premier League," he said.
It's not a simple task to get it there, but I'll probably just consider myself successful here if I get the club back there."
Ross has only been in charge for three years, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month short practice in Hearts' training staff.
Then he helped Alloa to resume from the dredging to the third division and helped St. Mirren from the brink of the dreary to win the master's title consecutive season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during the gambling career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
‘It was likely a proper separation of roads,’ he recalls when he took over the management of Alloa.
‘I really thought management was right for me, more correct than playing.
It sounds strange since I did it well, created a reasonable income of it and experienced some fine highlights.
But football games can be tough.
There's a lot of things you have to get through on a weekly basis.
I go through it in terms of stress and pressure at work, but management feels quite right for me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do, it feels like the most comfortable thing I've known all my adult life."

Perfect time for a pint is 17.30 on Saturdays, showing study
The summer’s heat wave has strengthened the income for the hard-pressed pubs of the United Kingdom, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pubers and bars experienced a turnover increase of 2.7% in July — while restaurant income fell 4.8%, shows figures.
Peter Martin, a business consultant, CGA, who summarized the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's unexpected long participation in the World Cup made July follow a pattern similar to the previous month of June, when pubs went up 2,8 %, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurant turnover in June was only worse in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had the far best result, but an increase that was stronger equal-for-like than the restaurants went down.
Puber with food-serving also had difficulty with the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for the restaurant drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted out to drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars increased turnover by 6,6 % that month, with food serving down 3 %».
Paul Newman, an analyst from the RSM hotel and restaurant industry, stated: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sporting and social events are still the main factors for external market turnover.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups still have difficulty, and a turnover drop of 4.8% of year-on-year will be particularly painful at the top of current cost pressures.
The long, warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food-serving establishments, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide a prolonged breathing room.”
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 % in July, reflecting the slowdown in rollouts of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, a trade controller for the pub, bar and restaurant sectors in the United Kingdom, collects and analyses the results of 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of GBP 9 billion, and is the established industry standard.
One in five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents.
One in five children - some are only 11 years old - have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers, showing research
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed pages of Fake Insta.
News has increased concerns about the sharing of sexual content.
20 % of the students said they have a ‘main account’ that they show their parents.
One in five children — some are only 11 years of age — create accounts on social media that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed rapid growth in fake Insta accounts – a reference to image sharing pages on Instagram.
News has increased concerns about the sharing of sexual content.
20 % of the students said they had an innocent “main account” that they refer to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to "kill me".
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the principals' conference for private schools revealed that 40 % of 11- to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to have secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, "It's scary that so many young people are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilith Doyle will be the "vote of the court-holders" of the Scottish Athletics board
Eilith Doyle has been elected the board of Scottish Athletics and has a non-executive role at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated courtman, and President Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those who lead the sport to gain insight into her extensive experience at international level over the last ten years.
‘Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world-wide community of civil rights, and we are sure that court-martials in Scotland will benefit from getting her into the board’, said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to be a voice for court-martial practitioners, and I hope I have a lot to contribute to guide sports in Scotland".
The American won 200 and 400 meters below the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996 and has a total of four Olympic gold.
She wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time will show if I want to be restored and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I am quite good again and have learned to walk again, and today I do exercise!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!"
Breast pump ad that compare mothers with cows split the public on the web
A breast pump company has split the opinion on the web with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump that is carried close to the body”, Elvie, the technology-based company for consumer goods, published a fresh and flirting music video-inspired advertisement to show freedom to the new pump that gives active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of tall and cows to a song with among other things the following text: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see any tails" and "In case you didn't understand it, this isn't udder, it's my pups."
The choir continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my balls".
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has created a storm on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has been given mixed feedback from the viewers, many say the beauty painting “gruaktion” in the dairy industry.
‘Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and feed to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth," one wrote.
Elvie chest pump gets nice space in a breast bra (Elvie/More)
Another comment was, ‘Obviously traumatic for both mother and baby.
But – hey, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another added: "For a failed advertisement".
Another defends the ad. A woman admitted that she thinks the song is "incredible fun".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd love to have one if I still breast-feed.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product', one that wrote.
Another comment: ‘This is a funny advertisement directed at mothers like pumps (often at work or toilets) and feels like cows’.
This is not an advertisement that celebrates or condemns the dairy industry».
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they've all danced with the discrete pump in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is perfectly stationary, has no wires or hoses and gets nice space in a sucker bra, so that women get the freedom to move, keep the baby and even go out while they pumps.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and dairy cows, we wanted to put search lights on breast pumping and all the challenges, while in a entertaining and recognizable way we show the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump gives.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a two-child mother appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrants moved to a tentleir at the Texas border in all secrecy
The number of migrant children arrested has been increasing, although the monthly border crossing has remained relatively stable, partly because the severe rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to place children with supporters.
Traditionally, most of the supporters themselves have been undocumented immigrants, and have been afraid to destroy their own chances of staying in the country by coming forward and claiming a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other household adults had to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albance, a senior official of immigration and customs authorities, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people seeking support for single minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested did not have previously criminal scrolls.
‘The next 80 % of those who are either supporters or members of the household to supporters are illegal in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we keep pursuing these people," says Albence.
The officers are trying to handle children more quickly and introduced new rules that suggest that some of them have to meet the court within one month of being arrested, rather than 60 days of the previous standard, according to the recipient.
Many will be produced via videoconferencing rather than being personally present to lead their case of residence for an immigration judge.
Those assessed as unjustified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer a child is in custody, the greater the risk of anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to receiving staff and reports that have emerged in the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that these concerns have grown at a larger plant such as Tornillo, where children who wear more easily are ignored because of the size of the plant.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare themselves emotionally or to take goodbye with friends can intensify traumas that many already struggle with.
Syria asks the United States, French and Turkish ‘ccupationary powers’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Minister of State, said that the foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under cover of combating terrorism and "will be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that ‘the war against terrorism so to speak is over’ in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011 and several million are on the run.
He said that Damascus will continue to ‘carry this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories’ for both terrorist groups and ‘all foreign presence’.
The United States has around 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and counselling of Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-headed country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said that conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused ‘some western country’ of ‘pre-irrational flight’ that causes the refugees to stay away.
"We have approached the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
They police what is really a purely humanitarian situation".
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major defence position of the rebels by Idlib has created an opportunity to press for political talks.
The Russian/German agreement has been a major-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces against the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had ‘clear deadlines’ and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from Al-Qaida-related Nusra Front, such as ‘will be wiped out’.
UN mission Staffan de Mistura hopes he will soon be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of state and non-governmental members to draw up a post-war Constitution for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem submitted the conditions under which the Syrian authorities would participate in the Committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited to ‘the review of the articles of the current Constitution’ and warn against interference.
Why Trump will win another period
After that logic, Trump would have won re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, national law and scandals end the presidency before that time.
In what would undoubtedly be the 'most dramatic conclusion of a presidency ever!'
At the moment, there's no sign of security.
Since 2014, the number of best transmission times has more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in peak broadcasting time, from 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen.
"This is a fire that people are attracted by because we don't understand anything," said Neal Baer, programmer of ABC drama "Designed Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a well-known comedy and writer of ‘Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club’, has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the elections in 2016.
The driver told him to vote on Trump.
She asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh."
It's an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the actions taking place in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can reconcile and health to the global economy.
Sign-up is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you go a long way to be an enlightened human being when you're sitting for six hours following a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep in background matter" for the book "Fear", Paul Manafor's leather jacket with ostrich worth $15,000 (a garment packed with hybris," said Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniels' colorful descriptions of Trumps, eh..., anatomy.
At least I don't want to look at Super Mario in the same way anymore.
"Some of what he does that makes it look like a reality show, is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, the Executive Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of ‘Pawn Stars’, about Trump show's varying role crew and daily twisting of the plot (crearing with NFL, shamerrose Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss one episode, otherwise you'll be hanging around.
When I met Fleiss this week, there were 27 °C and sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he lived in and looked at MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He couldn't tear himself loose, not when Brett Kavanaugh is going to meet the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in the United States is at stake.
"I remember when we put all the crazy programs in the old days and people said this is the end of the Western civilization," said Fleiss.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turned out they were right."

External money flows into the most regular inter-elections of the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing a stream of money after a conversion of a congressional district that ended with two seated representatives fighting for the same seat.
This newly-informed suburb in Pittsburg is running with the democratic representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a supplement election last spring.
Lamb opposes another seated representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is greatly overlapping the new 17th district.
The map was withdrawn after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were a constitutionally illegal manipulation of the constituencies of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive race for campaign funding between the main party funding groups, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a button said in a closely followed supplement choice for Pennsylvania's 18th district to Congress last March.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts have given democracy little leadership.
The United States evaluated sanctions against El Salvador for support to China, then drew the threat
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the management team to Trump Organization.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call back the American diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the 'recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan', said Heather Nauert, the spokesperson of the department, in an opinion earlier this month.
However, the sanctions were only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated 140 million dollars in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and death rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials postponed a conference at the top level focusing on security and economic growth to follow up a similar meeting last year that was considered a step forward in the attempt to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, officials of the top government made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, which stopped all the plans for criminal action against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of speaking to the conference, which is now scheduled in mid-October, to show the importance the administration adds to the collection, said the diplomat.
And the three American broadcasts calmly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new tough messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson at the White House of Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations on the assumption of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
History Learn
The next nail in the coffin can be Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to legal practice, for which there is now very solid evidence in public documents.
Mueller is also supposed to expand the investigation to whether Trumps campaigned cooperation with Russia in interference with our elections.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would be held accountable in that body, in the middle of the preparations to meet the voters again and perhaps finally a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertain factors, and I do not believe that Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor for his counterparts in Europe.
We all have to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938 German officers stood ready to make a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the vest had stood up against him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and lost the chance to avoid the years of bloodbaths that followed.
The course of history revolves around such tipping points, and the inexorable March of democracy is accelerated or inhibited.
The Americans are facing several of these tipping points now.
What will we do if Trump fires Vice-President Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in deep weather since this newspaper announced that last year he proposed secret listenings to the president and wondered that he was rude to be president.
Rosenstein says that The Times' presentation is incorrect.
‘How will we react if the recently launched FBI review of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair — or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible assault charges and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote during the inter-election for a Congress that will put Trump in charge?
If we fail to pass those tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because of the experience I got in Prague.
My mother was a Czecho-lovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me off to light the Sabbath on the table with the cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I not look optimisticly at our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic before the meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will accept Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians after the impressive drama battle in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knelt prevented the midwayer Graham Dorrans from doing his first season behavior in the draw game 2-2 against Villarreal, but he thinks Rangers can use the result as a springboard to get to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game and thought we could get to something and got one point.
Maybe we could have nodded at the end, but a draw was probably a good result.
They were probably better in the first place, and we came out in the second time and were the best team.
On Thursday, there will be another big night in Europe.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last fight, but with the home republic in my back, I'm sure we can stand on and get a positive result.
The fourth year was absolutely tough, between everything that happened to my injuries and the replacements in the club itself, but there's a good feeling now.
The team is good and the guys are kissing; the training is good.
Hopefully we can get on now, put the last season behind us and get it to."
Women lose their nighttime sleep because of the fear of pension saving
Although the participants in the study had a clear form of how they wanted to be taken care of, there were few who talked to the family about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to the spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to the kids about it.
"People want to be taken care of by some members of the family, but they do nothing to take that call," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide's life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to the spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to give you care if you don't say what you want in advance.
Discussions with the adviser and family where and how care is to be given.
Include your financial advisor: The adviser can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
The financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-valued hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets — if you have enough money.
Develop your legal documents: Clear away from legal problems immediately.
Get a health authorisation in place by appointing a person you have trusted to have an overview of your medical care and to make sure that healthcare professionals will comply with your wishes if you are prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving some authority over your economy.
You choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your bills are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your old parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write out the details in an overview so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just the economy that’s at stake – who are the doctors?” asked Martin.

Man shot several times with an air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air gun when he was on his way home after an outlaw.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot into his chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as an ‘unmotivated action’.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a heavy earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and the death figures are expected to rise.
The communication is inoperative and rescue workers have not been able to obtain information from Dongala Accounting, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with strength 7,5.
In Palu more than 16 000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and the tsunami.
Doggala is a reinsurance that extends over 300 km along the coast line of the north-west part of the island of Sulawesi.
The company, an administrative region below the province level, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the support beams of the central province of Sulawesi's economy, in particular the coast region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia’s emergency administration.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit west of Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia lies on the Seismic Ageing in the Pacific and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province north of Sumatra on 26 December, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226 000 people along the coast of Indian, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6,8 magnitude hit south on Java, Indonesia’s most populated island and triggered a tsunami that struck across the south coast. Nearly 700 were killed.
2009: An earthquake with a force of 7.6 occurred near the town of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a force of 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands, outside Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 metres that raged dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic while people remembered the armies of the mortal earthquake and the tsunami in 2004.
There was no tsunami triggered this time, but over 100 were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombok and kill more than 500 people, most on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and resulted in thousands of tourists being temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Alaska Governor and Vice President Sarah Palin, have been arrested following assault charges.
Palin, 29 years from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested after suspicion of domestic violence, clucking with a report on domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he should have taken the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged assault.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su custody prison and arrested for an unsecured note worth $500, reported KTUU.
He was presented to the court on Saturday, where he declared himself “not guilty, absolutely” when he was asked how he asked himself to the guilt issue, reported the network.
Palin is confronted with three class A misconducts, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and put on a fine of $25,000.
He has also been charged with a class B offence, which can be punished with one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that it has been directed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the alleged assault.
The case will be conducted in Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was targeted for domestic violence, clucking with the report of domestic violence and holding a weapon while intoxicating the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he struck her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behaviour to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: several hundred killed
At least 384 people are killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake with force 7.5 triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and mortality rates are expected to rise over the next few days.
The earthquake hit right next to central Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social media that show the outbreak.
Several hundred people were gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami dundled across the beach.
Federal prosecutions rarely seek death sentences for suspected terrorist attacks in New York City
Federal prosecution authorities in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not been committed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, apparently used a rental car from Home Depot to perform an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he mean down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecution has to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims ‘conceived’ and caused serious physical damage intentionally, in accordance with the warning of its intention to seek the death penalty in Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for a possible death penalty, according to the file.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury of 22-point speech, including eight sightings for the murder of money blackmail, in the face of Saipov, normally used by federal prosecutions in cases of organised crime, and a screening for vehicle violence and wreckage.
The attack required “significant planning and continued,” said the actor, who described the way Saipov performed it as “holy, cruel and depraved”.
‘Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injuries, property creations and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’, states the notification on purpose.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the last time Southern District of New York led a case that could punish death.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug salesmen, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York, in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to perform spying on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no indication in the days and months after the attack, according to the legal documents.
He told the investigators that he was pleased with what he had done, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after watching ISIS videos on his cell phone, according to the aim.
He also asked to suspend the ISIS flag in the hospital room, said the police.
He did not declare himself guilty after the charges of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the government-designated defenders of Saipov, said they were ‘obviously disappointed’ about the decision of the prosecution authority.
‘We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty instead of accepting a confession and life in prison without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,’ said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecution authorities not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be given responsibility for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to ‘mobilize the army of the people’s army’ today during a demonstration at the Tory Conference.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians would get the "sensor pressure" from the Eurosceptics – when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he should be responsible for the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that the United Kingdom “would have been utraded” now if Farage was Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge for May to reconcile its deeply divided rows has been underlined by pro-Remain Tories who participated in their own demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep the Brexit plan tracked against attacks by Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she would go on trying to reach an agreement with Brüssel despite the backlash – and force eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "kaos".
Bone told the "Notification" demonstrations in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a member and been responsible for the negotiations with Brüssel.
"If he had been responsible, we would have been out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I want to stand on for Brexit, but we have to reject the Brxit Plan".
When he explained his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in two world wars to be subversive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone dismissed allegations that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The claim that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain in the EU is completely wrong’.
Tory Brexitier Andrea Jenkys also participated in the demonstration and told reporters, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘The British plan is unpopular with the public. The opposition will not vote for it. It is unpopular with the party and with our activists, who are actually the ones who are running the streets and getting us elected in the first place.
Discard the Brexit plan and start listening’.
In a direct message to May, she added: ‘State ministers keep the job when they keep their promises’.
Farage stated that politicians would be given “feel pressure” if they thought of betraying the decision taken at the popular vote in 2016.
“This is now about the trust between us – the people – and that politicians,” he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to let them know they won't get away with it."
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to let our politicians, who are on their way to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
We mobilise the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before they had a two-hour political gathering in the center of the city.
A small amount of activists fanned with Tories Against Brexit banners after launching the group this weekend.
Labour Member Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives of the security problems they had with a party app when the conference started.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a friction-free limit, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
‘It is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren seriously believes to be a presiding candidate
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll "consider serious being a presidential candidate" after the election in November.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democrats from Massachusetts talked about the future during a town hall meeting west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, re-elects the Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was Vice President of the Trumps Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She's been at the heart of the speculations if she's going to stand against Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters, who have used the town hall format since Trump became president.
A participant asked her if she was planning to be a presidential candidate.
Warren said it's time that "females get to Washington to fix our defective government, and it includes a woman on top".
Arre station after Swims from the LSU was killed by shooting
The Baton Rouge police, Los Angeles, reported on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting incident that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The police in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at a news conference at 11.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near campus at Southern University early Friday.
“Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in his head and died as a result of it,” told Sheriff Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was at the place and had weapons with him.
Simpson was arrested without excitement and was in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish police chamber.
Sims was a two-metre-high youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 matches with 10 starting the previous season.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton looks towards the world champion title after the stable order gives him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' stable order would play a major role in the race.
From the pole Bottas got a good start and almost swept Hamilton off the track while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vitell drove into the depot first and let Hamilton continue to run in the back of the main field, which should have been crucial.
Mercedes made a pit stop a round later and came out behind the Vestel, but Hamilton drove himself up after some snuffing with the wheels which made the Ferrari-driver reluctantly leave the inside free after a double passage to defend himself in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the field and came in as number seven at the end of the first round of his 21st anniversary.
Then he led in large parts of the race while laying on the wheels to try to get to a quick conclusion and overpower Kimi Raikkonen who lay as at four.
He finally got inside the depot on the 44th round, but he couldn't increase the pace of the remaining eight rounds and the Raikkon took the fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a wonderful job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me out.
The team has done a wonderful job to get a good tossann," said Hamilton.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein during a political event on Saturday for her confirmation that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
When the President spoke during an event in West Virginia, he did not refer directly to Ford's testimony before the Senate's Justice Committee, but he commented that what was going on in the Senate shows that people are "bad-minded, faltering and speaking untrue".
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the last few days of the Senate, when you experience the mind, when you see people who are angry and ugly and falsy and talk untrue," he said.
"When you look at deliveries and leaks, they say, "Oh, I haven't done it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Remember her answer... did you leak the document--'Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked."
Hey, wait a minute.
He added, with an imitation of the Senator's voice.
Feinstein was sent the letter with detailed information about the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September--but Feinstein refused that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak her story," said Feinstein to the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked."
But her denial was not taken graciously by the president, who, during the party event Saturday night, said, "I'll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continued defense by the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the democrats used the allegations for their own purposes.
‘They have decided to withdraw power by all necessary means.
You see the madness, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to overrun to get the power and control,' the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer got two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return campaign in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants got a two-way lead early through a shot from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie compensated for the home team before Dwyer restored the management of Giants.
Francois Bouchard compensated Dundee before two targets by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League loss for the season of Adam Keefe's men, who had come back after they struck Dundee 2-1 in Belfast's Friday evening.
It was the third meeting of the season between the teams, and the Giants had won the three previous battles.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford put up the game when Beauvillier doubled management four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt posted to Cownie's equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that Giants had management at break when he took his second goal for the evening at the end of the first round.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard devalued once again with a mastery goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined together to help Nielsen to give Dundee management for the first time during the fight late in the second round, and he secured the victory with the team's fifths halfway out in the final round.
Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next fight on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure that several hundred passengers escape earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is shelfed as soon as he died and ensured that an aeroplane that had hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people have died, and many have been missed after a powerful earthquake hit Sulawesi's island on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful afterquakes continue to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after the colleagues had flown to life, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the strongly swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu Airport.
He remained to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the runway just then, could safely light.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died later in a hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him today morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts burst when we heard it," he added.
The authorities fear that the numbers of deaths may be raised in thousands, and the country’s emergency response agency reports limited access to the cities of Doggala, Sigi and Boutong.
‘The numbers are expected to increase further since many equals are still trapped under the ruins and many have not been able to reach,’ said the spokesperson for the body, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six-foot-high waves have shaken Palu, who will keep a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “All the time, you see ambulances picking up deaths.
There is a lack of clean water.
Minimarkets are being broken down everywhere».
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, stated to CNN: "Indonesian Red Cross works felish to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to perform all the tasks of the evacuation.
Are you ready?’ reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Flight Crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing after the plane crashed in the lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed in a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean, Micronesia, now says that one man is missing.
Air Niugini said in a press release that it was one male passenger per Saturday afternoon they had no overview of.
The airline said they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The carrier did not respond immediately to the request for further details on the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and the state of everyone was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said that the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was missed on the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others were able to wade through the waist depth of water to the emergency exit of the sinking aeroplane.
He said that the aerospaces had panic and screamed, and that he had a minor head injury.
U.S. Navy said sailors who worked in the vicinity to repair a dock, also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters below the water surface.
Aviation Safety Network data suggests that 111 people have been killed in PNG-registered aircraft crashes for the last twenty years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analysts put forward the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution authorities terminated the procedure on Saturday in a new case for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. analyst in the Ministry of Justice, Paul Rowlett, witnessed for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile prints to breathe together the movements to 29-year-olds, Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, which fought against what he had claimed earlier, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same place as the phone to Chambers in the time he claimed to have been with friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness box on Saturday and claimed that he was not in the city that day.
When the DA asked about Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in the trailer to Sanford that night, Sanford said that he "roof because my trailer was in Nashville".
Another disagreement was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile printing suggests that they had only known each other for one week.
Rowlett said that a little after Chambers' death, erased Tellis' calls, contact details and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
'He deleted her from his life,' said Hale.
The defence shall commence its procedure on Sunday as planned.
The judge said he expected the matter to be left the jury later that day.

Another black person?!
Children's passports in New York sue pairs for cancellation after ‘racist’ notification
A babysitter in New York sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after having received a falsely sent message from the mother, who complained that she was “all a black person”.
The couple reject that they are racist and compare the case with ‘expressing’.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a two-child mother, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up to the first working day of 2016.
"NEEEEEII ENDA A SUPPLEMENTARY PERSON" wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the tab, there was a “uncomfortable” Plasco-Flaxman who gave up Maurice, claiming that their abandoned babysitter, who was African American, had done a bad job and that she had expected someone from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her one working day and was then sent home with a Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the cancellation and demanding compensation in the order of 350 dollars per day for the six-month-long pilot-based scheme she was promised, but without a contract.
"I wanted to show them that – hey, you just don't," she said to the New York Post on Friday, and added, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple have turned back on the charges that they are racist and say the termination of Maurice was the only right thing, since they did not feel they could trust her after insulting her.
«My wife sent her something that she had not intended to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said the man Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
'But would you have left your children to someone you'd been rude to, even though it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
The comparison of the case with ‘expressing’ says Plasco was due to his wife having only two months to term and was in a ‘very difficult situation’.
‘Is it such a person that you wish to punish?
It is not very nice’, added to the stock broker.
While the legal case goes its way, the popular court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticise them for their behavior and attitudes.
The publisher of Paddington feared that the readers would not accept a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was adopted, said about the letter: "It's hard to sit in someone else's place when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She said the father, who had worked as a cameraman in the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book by a small noise bear, would have been very pleased that his work had been rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book release was "bitter-sweet" after he passed away last year.
She describes Paddington as a “an important family member” and adds that her father in secret was very proud of the success he achieved.
"He was a rather quiet man, and he was not a boastful person," she said.
'But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child doing a trick: you're proud of it even though it's not really your fault.
I think he looked at Paddington's success a little that way.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he used always to give credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone
On landing, the daughter had been forced to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
'Nad called regularly to say that it looked bad, that he didn't think she would survive,' said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the phone from Nad who said she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I'm so fond of you, my friend.
I'll come to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medical doctors had given her to make her heart beat, slowly lost her effect and left the system.
She died a while earlier and the organs in her body clapped together.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it happened.
I couldn't holler and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned over the loss of his daughter, was on board the plane with the other passengers – who did not know about the trials she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
‘I looked down all the time and the tears ran into a steady stream.
It's hard to explain, but it was there on the plane I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postcard with caring women to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted postcards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers people can call for help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 when he was struck by depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to experience what I have to experience every day," she said.
45-year-old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says that the son was a promising cook with an infective smile.
"Everybody knew him at the smile.
They said that his smile could brighten up any room."
He left work before he died because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother of Tyler was one of those who found him after he took his life.
Sharon says, "I worry all the time that there's going to be an infective effect".
Sharon put the cards "to tell people that there are people out there that they can go to and talk to, even though it's just a friend.
Not to yourself -- you need to talk to someone."
Kelly, who has been Sharon's girlfriend for many years, lost Mark, the partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he felt depressed or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed the changed mood.
On Christmas Day he was completely in the cellar – when the kids opened the Christmas Fairies, they did not have eye contact or anything”.
She says his death was a big trauma to them, but they have to fight through it: "It tears up a big hole in the family.
It tears us apart.
But we all have to endure and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts investigating
"I thought that if we could get to some of what he asked for – a time-limited investigation – we could perhaps come to a certain agreement," said Flake on Saturday, and added that he feared that the committee "shunk apart" along locked party boundaries.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The reluctance was due to timing.
The delay is only five weeks away, on 6 November – if Republicans are likely to do bad, it will be much more difficult for them to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has called around for senators and driven lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met her wife Ashley there when she was personal secretary for Bush.
What happens after the FBI has delivered its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, so Vice President Mike Pence can use his double voice and get him in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean dropper “faller” under Kim
The number of North Korean Jumpers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator announced.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from South Korea's Department of Collection, said there had been 1127 rounds last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park stated that stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices in human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang hasn't made any public comment.
Most of North Korea's apostates are offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of the flights via China, which have the longest border towards North Korea and are easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China sees them as illegal migrants, not refugees, and returns them with power.
The relationship between the North and the South — which is technically still at war — has improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met for talks that were about the locked-up negotiations on denuclearisation.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they largely agreed to work for an atomic-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the United States for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no possibility that we will unilaterally rust down first," said Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric" and says he is uneasy to sit in the Supreme Court
Minority leader at the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh 'hysteric' the Supreme Court and said he had a temperament that made him unfit to sit in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave the statements in an interview on Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
'I couldn't but think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would be called hysterical,' said Pelosi regarding his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied his emotional attachment that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, sometimes he almost cried out and was greedy when he talked about the family and the years in high school.
He was also strongly condemning the democrats of the Committee and called the allegations against him a ‘grotesque and co-ordinated character killing’ organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony shows that he can't sit in the Supreme Court because it shows that he's presumptuous against Democrats.
"I mean he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked whether she would try to put Kavanaugh in court if he was approved and if the democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I want to say this – if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he's not only unspeakable to sit in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he's sitting in now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (airport rights), since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the question, Kavanaugh avoided asking whether he would review certain Supreme Court decisions.
‘This is not the time to send a hysterical, partial person to the Supreme Court and expect us to apply it,’ said Pelosi.
And women have to handle it.
It's a fair tragedy, months and years where the mind takes over, and she can't get it out without crying.
“We weep when we are angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
'I don't think it's so nice, do you?'
She goes on to say, "I got good help from a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said that she also weeps when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she became angry and began to cry, she said to the person she spoke to "you think I might be sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
And that's what I thought was great.
Tears are allowed to expire partially because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories from one of my first jobs was in a man's domaind office. I began to cry with inexplicable rage and was arrested in the neck collar by an elderly woman – a cool boss whom I had always been a little afraid of – who took me to a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're furious.
They'll think you're sad and happy because they were able to take you."
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he was a presiding candidate.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to be unfaithful to the spouse on board a boat named Monkey Business and withdrew from the election, Schroeder was very frustrated and thought that there was nothing in the way of investigating the possibilities of standing as a presidential candidate himself.
"It wasn't a thoughtful decision," she said with a laughter 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last ones they needed were one more.
Some called it the Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
Since it was closer to the end of the campaign, she was behind with the funding and sworn that she would not quiet if she didn't get 2 million dollars.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of the support players who gave $1,000 to men, just gave her $250.
‘Do they think I get a discount, or?’ she wonders.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotion – gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to drive in money and to reach voters instead of delegates, and mind over sexism – that she fell into tears.
"You would think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls how the press referred to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my lead sponsor.
I remember thinking, "What would they write on my tomb stand?"
'She cry?'"
How the US-China Trade War Can Help Beijing
The opening-salves of the trade war between the United States and China were ear-dead, and although the struggle is far from over, a tear between countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, says experts.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by putting customs duties on important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The main escalation took place this week with new customs duties on goods worth $200 billion, which means customs duties on half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing, of course, has returned each time, now at the latest by a five to ten percent stake on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match the US attacks for attack, and the world's second largest economy will probably not lift the white flag with the first.
Getting Washington to descend means giving in to demands, but public submission to the United States will be far too humiliating to the Chinese President, Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, pressure around the trade war with the United States can give positive outcome to China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
‘The fact that a rapid political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that start economic confusion in one of the countries is in fact much more dangerous than the spectators have realized in the past,’ said Abigail Grace, a research fellow focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a thought-mie.
Syria "ready" for return of refugees says Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says they're ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help to re-enter the country, which is raged after more than 7 years of war.
When he spoke in the United Nations National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he says.
The state continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions now facilitate the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war started in 2011.
In addition, there are six million people who still live in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime will accept the help of rebuilding the damaged country.
But he stressed that it would not be accepted conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe secures Ryder Cup owner in Paris
Team Europe has won 2018 Ryder Cup after turning Team United States with a final result of 16.5 versus 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive lives on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the throne when the team captain of the Danish team Thomas Bjørn got the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mikkelson, who had to see himself turned off by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant in all his rounds and became 1 out of 4 golfers who have ever gone 5-0-0 since the tournament got its current design in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was kicked out 5 and 4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top-ranking player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup finale.
With all eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind them, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most winning European of the tournament over time with 25.5 career points.
‘I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas picked me out and had faith in me.
I'm very, very happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He left the stick to his countryman John Ram, who struck the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in single games on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods – I followed that man close to the rise,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a registration of 13-21-3 career points in Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics for one of the biggest golfers ever, who have won 14 major titles, just turned off Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA spent the whole weekend finding fairways, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf with high precision throughout the tournament.
The U.S. captain Jim Furyk stated after a disappointing performance for his troops, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
It was momentarily this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves.
Hat off for Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We want to regroup, I want to work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and I want to look forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their team captain.
You just have to take off your hat.
We were turned on."
