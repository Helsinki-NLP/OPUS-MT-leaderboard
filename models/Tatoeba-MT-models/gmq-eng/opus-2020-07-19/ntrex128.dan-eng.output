Politicians in Wales afraid to "liken fools"
There was horror among some members of the Walis National Assembly on a proposal that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This has occurred because of plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs from all over the political spectrum are concerned that name change could give rise to ridicule.
A member of the party Labour said his group was worried because "it rhymes at Twp and Pwp".
To readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means silly, and pwp means shit.
One member of the Plaid Cymru party said that the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said that his group was "open" to the name change, but noticed that there is only a short verbal jump from MWP to Muppet (fjols).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is expressed in the same way as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently putting together a legislative proposal to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on the names that Members of this House will receive is, of course, up to Members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 empowered the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals, in which there was broad support for calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members (Walisian Members) or WMPs, but MWP was given the greatest support in a public consultation.
It seems that AMs are proposing alternative options, but the struggle for consensus can be difficult for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to put together a legislative proposal on the changes within a few weeks.
The legislative proposal on reform contains other changes in the way the House is working, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs are given the final vote on what to call them when the bill is debated.
Makers shall vote on the amendment of the country's name.
The voters vote Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to "the Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote will be held in an attempt to resolve a long decades of conflict with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has their own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim on the territory of Greece and has long protested against Macedonia's attempts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Mr Ivanov, opposes the vote and says that he will reject the vote.
Members of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is merely a price paid for becoming a member of the European Union and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's will be quiet while the churches in Harlem are fighting
"The older people I've talked to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there are none of the parts."
He said it's understandable that the bars go away.
"People socialise in other ways these days," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood, where people enter on a daily basis."
In relation to churches, he is concerned that the money collected to sell assets does not last long and that they "before or later are back where they started".
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes full of those kind of people who don't help the neighborhood's recurring havens.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy ownership apartments in these buildings are white," he says, "and it breathes further to the development where these churches eventually close completely, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the ownership apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had operated nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black church under the priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, which would not hire or promote black.
A fire in 1939 damaged the building severely, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to restore the building, they ordered the bell game.
The priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor in St Martin's, proudly called the bell game "the poor's bells".
The expert who played at the bell game in June called it something different: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first watch game in the world that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger watch game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merryweather said that St. Martin's didn't find a substitute for him.
What has been going on in St Martin's over the last few months has been a complicated tale of architects and contractors. Some of them caught up in the church leaders, others of the bishopy.
In July, the Council of Ministers – the leading body of the sun, composed of leading laymen – wrote to the Bispecary about concerns that the bishopy "will try to push the expenses forward" to the congregation council, even if the congregation council had not been involved in employing the architects and contractors who the Bispecary sent in.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishopial congregation.
Shark damage 13-year-olds on diving trips after lobsters in California
A shark attack and injured a 13-year-old boy when he dived for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, says officials.
The attack took place just before 7 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and then along with a group paddled over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just enthusiasm to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy shouted, "I was bitten!
I got bitten!"
"All his collars were raised," Hammel said when he came to the boy.
"I cried out that everyone should come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reported in critical condition.
It's not known what kind of shark attacked.
The lifeguard Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage to his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the stretch from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for safety and to conduct investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to consume the beauty market in Britain
Sainsbury's takes up competition with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with rows of beauty products with special assistants in style with magistrates.
As part of a great effort to capture Britain’s beauty market, which has a value of GBP 2.8 billion and continues to grow, while fashion and housing products fall. The larger rows of beauty products are tested in 11 shops around the country and launched in several shops next year, if they prove successful.
The investment in beauty products takes place as supermarkets are looking for new goods for shelves that were previously used for television, microwaves and housing products.
Sainsbury's says that they double their range of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw that are introduced for the first time.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also has more space with branded areas like those seen in shops like Boots.
The Supermarket is also relaunching the range of Boutique Makeup, so most of the products are suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly required by younger shoppers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop parfume store is testing in two Sainsbury's shops. The first opened up in Croydon in the south of London last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a development against the purchase of small amounts of food daily at local merchants mean that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, Director of Sainsbury's, has said that the shops are going to look like storehouses, as the supermarket chain takes up the fight with the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argo's sales sites in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales sites since they bought both chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their sales of food and have made purchases more profitable.
Supermarket's previous attempt to update beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint initiative with Boots in the early 00's, but the cooperation ended with a argument about how the profits of the pharmacy in the supermarkets should be distributed.
The new strategy comes, after Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy chain with 281 stores to Celesio, who owns the chain Lloyd's Pharmacy, for GBP 125 three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding a further range of luxury skin care fires such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the appearance and layout of our rows of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available for advice.
Our range of fires is designed to suit all needs and the consuming environment and the practical locations means that we are now a convincing destination that challenges the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones "pussing", after Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to GBP 11 million
Dragons' Den-star Peter Jones left "pussing", after TV host Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to GBP 11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their housing product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop Fire.
This Morning host, 37, went to Instagram to announce that she is leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' The Star Peter Jones furious, after she withdraws from their lucrative lifestyle fire at the last moment – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "pussy", as the popular TV woman during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, meant that her new agreements – worth up to GBP 1.5 million – meant that she no longer had enough time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared with Gwyneth Paltrows Goop-brand and was tipped to double Willoughbys estimated property of GBP 11 million.
Willoughby, 37, went to Instagram to announce that she left Truly while Jones flew out of Britain to one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project that she would have to deal with for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow headquarters, which are already ready for sale."
Experts consider that the output from this Morning host, which is among UK stars with highest earnings, can cost the company several million because of large investments in products – ranging from pillows to candles to clothing and home products – and the potential for further delays in launch.
And it can also end up in a long friendship.
Mother of three Willoughby and master Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as Chairman of the Board in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall be a fire ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as hosted at ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business action."
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
He made fun of the criticism he would get from the news media to make a comment that "is not a President worthy" and to be so positive to the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his parody on a news host.
"I gave up nothing."
He noticed that Kim is interested in a meeting more, after Trump proclaimed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been suspended.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho Saturday the world leaders of the UN General Assembly told that North Korea does not see a "equivalent reaction" from the United States compared to North Korea's initial anti-armament action.
He noted that, instead, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure running.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view in the speech at his electors' meeting.
"It's going really well with North Korea," he said.
"There was a call for war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his attempt to improve the relationship with Kim had produced positive results – termination of rocket tests, help with the release of hostages and return of earthly remnants from U.S. military men.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
"It is so easy to behave Stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this densely packed arena, we would have about 200 people standing there," said Trump and pointed to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquakes destroy the island and kill several hundred
For example, in the post-Lombok earthquake, non-governmental organisations were informed that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population were left without home, the state of national disaster was not declared, which is a prerequisite for calling for international emergency aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it has been clear that they do not request international assistance, so it is a little challenging," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children compile a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson for national emergency response, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Because of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly exposed to, the country is very poorly prepared for natural disasters.
There are built tsunami refuges in Aceh, but they are not a common view of other coastlines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but a tsunamisirene appears to be missing, and it has probably affected the mortality rate.
Even under the best conditions it is challenging to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's inadequate infrastructure a central point in his election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and train routes.
However, Mr Joko's administration has been plagued by a lack of funding in the wake of the election campaign next year.
Mr Joko is also experiencing pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were removed from their homes when Christians and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with mashedets, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge cancels out at the last moment against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League to Chelsea with a scoring in 89 minutes on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a drop from Xherdan Shaqi small 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, while his team was behind with 1-0.
He dotted to the ball with his left foot before he made a high shot at the farthest pole.
The ball flew high over the field towards the top right corner of the grid.
The ball dropped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just about getting in the position to get hold of the ball. Players like Shaq always try to get as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, and I made a single touch, and I didn't think much of it and I just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 at the half league, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored for the 25th minute.
The Chelsea attacker returned with the heel to Mateo Kovacic before he set the speed up to the midway and crept into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made a quick one-two on the midfield.
He then made a long delivery that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defense and finished against the farthest post with a shot with left foot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights Napoli in the group game in Champions League at 15 Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in UEFA Europe Leaguge at 15 Thursday in London.
Death rate from tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death rate from Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832 reports the country’s emergency emergency early Sunday.
There were reports of many caught in the rubble from buildings falling after the earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the richer scale. It hit Friday and created up to 6 meters high waves, the spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told us at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by rubble from collapsing buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old suspect in murder after a woman's death.

I would also like to urge everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with Dashcam, to contact us as they may have information that can be crucial to the investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose bodies were found is from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon friends who believe to know the woman arrived on site asking questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police state that they are informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment, but is told by the police no one can get into the building.
He was paralysed when he heard what had happened.
The citizens are now told that several hours will pass before they can get back in.
A police officer was interrogated to a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman arrives.
She keeps repeating, "it's so terrible."

A number of officers were in the perimeter watching the apartment complex.
All with information please write a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and give log 247 on 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell will be the most recent memorial which is the subject of discussion on "rewrite of history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, performed by his fanatical, puritanic followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "madness" and an "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the context of the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace at Westminster would become a goal.
The billstorm during the British Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is sacrificed for his ancestor Thomas' actions in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's fantastic image of Cromwell is a demonstration of attitudes in the 19th century and part of the history of a figure which many still believe is worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate image is under ongoing historical debate.
What lies certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure representing one side of the struggle.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer pig attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in south-west China according to local media reports.
The man who was only identified under his surname "Yuan", was found dead with an overreach heart rate vein and wrapped in blood near a pig trail on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farm is preparing to inject pigs with vaccines in a pig market on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the Qinghai province of China.
He had allegedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pig path next door was open.
He said that in the pig path there was a large ferret with blood in his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kg pig had bitten the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and barren," said the cousin who goes under the surname "Wu", in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Security cameras recorded that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it attacking others while police collect evidence at the crime scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
It belongs to the rare units, but there have been previously registered cases where pigs have attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier a pig of 295 kg must have been a Welsh farmer against his tractor, into his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba CBC News said that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can function as a "trigger".
"They're just playful.
Those ravens, they're very curious... they're not trying to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect," he said.
The rest of Hurricane Rosa is expected to give heavy rain in large parts of the south-west United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it moves over the cooler water on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will provide heavy floods in northern Mexico and southwest America over the coming days.
Rosa had won 38 m/s, a category 1 organ, at 10 Sundays (Danish Time) and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north Sunday.
At the same time, there is a low-pressure outlet across the Pacific, which is moving east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push tropical moisture to the north into the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm of rain in parts of Mexico Monday.
Then the tropical moisture will interact with the low-pressure outlet, which is coming closer, and create heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storm tides, liquid falls and possibly landslides in the desert.
The tropical moisture will create rain with up to 51 to 76 mm of rain per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There is great likelihood of storm floods with rapidly worsening conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move out into the desert on foot when there is danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can transform divides into dazzling rivers and thunder will create strong local winds and create dust blow.
The approaching low-pressure outlet will provide heavy rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total rainfall exceeding 13 mm, which can provide smaller amounts of liquid precipitation and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the region in their raintime.
Scattered tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners Tuesday area and continue Wednesday.
In October, there may be great temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic becomes cooler, but it remains fairly hot in the tropics.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences through the central United States Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the north-east regions.
There may be up to 26 degrees in New York City Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long climate outlook indicates that there is a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million saw the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million saw Thursday's gripping testimony from the nominated Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman, who has accused him of a sexual assault, which was supposedly taking place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle with stations that interrupted the ordinary programmes to tell about Friday's late development continued: an agreement composed of Senator from Arizona Jeff Flake, who allowed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate's judicial committee that she's 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh, in drunk state, grinned at her and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he's 100% sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million saw Friday.
The company reported average ratings at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediately available ratings from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems measuring how many people see programmes in offices.
To put it in perspective, it is a viewer's number that corresponds to a match during the NFL playoffs or Oscar distribution.
Fox News Channel, whose meaningful hosts have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing, which lasted all day, said Nielsen.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught for open CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, while demonstrators shouted at him when he tried to take an elevator to the hearing of the judicial committee.
He's been looking down for several minutes while he was being accused, and CNN sent live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing in the committee.
All the television stations covered live a few hours later when the judicial committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should go on to a vote for the whole Senate.
But Flake said that he would only vote for under the belief that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominated one in the next week, as the democrats who are under the Senate had called for.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flakes' choice had an influence because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of "leg politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU to "play politics" with the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
The UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to Theresa May on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson presented her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal for the United Kingdom and the European Union to collect each other's tariffs was "all through ridiculous".
Shooting on Wayde Sims: The police arrest Dyteon Simpson who is suspected of behind the LSU player's death
The police have arrested a suspect for the shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of negligent manslaughter, said the police in Baton Rouge.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on, reported the CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After the questioning of Simpson, the police said he confessed to the shooting at Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, reporting the lawyer.
The forensic scientist in East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday saying that the cause of death was a wound from a gunshot that went from head to neck.
The police department says that a task force from Louisiana State Police, state police lab, Southern University police and citizens in the area have assisted the investigation leading to the arrest.
The sports leader at LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police in the area for their " care and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm high front grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Friday morning, the basketball coach at LSU, Will Wade, said that the team is "gone" and "in shock" over the death of Waydes.
"That's the kind of thing you're always afraid of," said Wade.
Vulcan sprays ashes over Mexico City
Ash spewed from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern neighbourhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Emergency Prevention Centre warned on Saturday Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater and 183 gas and ash spills were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring the space and shaking over several rounds.
Social media images showed thin layers of ash on car routes in the neighbourhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have noted increased activity in the volcano located 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, since an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the richer scale rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The Vulcan known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
The police are in conflict with Catalan separatists prior to the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after demonstrators who want independence, joined with unresters, as several thousand participated in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of the Catalan polarist vote on emancipation.
A group of masked separatists held unrest, threw with and powder painting and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There were fights later on the day when the police used their staff to keep the fighting down.
Over several hours, independence groups cried out "Nothing forgotten, nothing forgiven" and were met with Unionist demonstrators who shouted "Long live Spain".
14 people received treatment for minor injuries that occurred during the protests, reported the local press.
The atmosphere continues to be high in the region of independence one year after the vote on 1 October, which was declared illegal from Madrid, but celebrated by separatist catalists.
The voters voted to an overwhelming extent for independence, but the vote was low, and those who were opposed to the release were boycotted in large measure.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote in violent clashes at voting sites throughout the region.
Independence teams had camped last night to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration was held, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer dared hope for the Catalan to achieve independence.
"For the last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy at having been given the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they were given a narrow but important victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan Independence Parties have fought to maintain momentum, and many of their best-known leaders have either moved into exile or sitting in Denition and are awaiting judgment for their role in the holding of the vote and the subsequent Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, took up protests on his phone to support the police and said that the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"There's getting bigger and bigger tensions," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been waiting for his trial since last year, announced that he would present his election to the European Parliament next year.
"The position as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to reject the backdrop of democratic values and the subjugation we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested, after house hit by car
Three men of 33, 34, and 39 are arrested after a car several times entered a house in Londonderry.
The incident happened in Ballynagard Crescent Thursday about 19.30 BST.
Detective Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow might also be fired at the car at some point.
Shots from Menga give Livingston victory at 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Mengas's first goal for Livingston assured victory
The uprisings Livingston surprised Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mengas shot the difference when Gary Holt's team moved up side by side with Hibernian on second place.
Gerrard's team has not won out in the league during this season and will meet the leading team Hears, which they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before then, Rangers will be visited by Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, expands their unbeatable strip to six games, and Chief Coach Holt has still not had a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against cash withdrawals
Holt's team should have been ahead of them long before they scored, and their direct playing style created major problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but handed over across in front of the target, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the target after he slipped in to hit Craig Hallkett's transverse head in front of the target.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them because they knew that they could cause problems in deathball situations.
And it was under the circumstances that the important goal came.
Rangers committed a free kick, and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created the compound for Menga, which made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
At that time, Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but struggled to get through the domestic defense, and the goaler Liam Kelly was virtually not challenged.
That pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos delayed a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was turned off with the feet of the Ranger's painter Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame in another of Livingston's deathball situations.
There were continuous deliveries into Livingston's field, but were rejected, and two demands for a penalty park – after the Hallkett tackle on the replacement Glenn Middleton and one by hand on the ball – were rejected.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal effort and strong result for Livingston.
Everyone played great and exceeds the expectations of their upward journey.
Their playing style and squad are largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but much of the honor must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he entered.
There were a lot of heroes.
The commander of Halkett was amazing and led a well-organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the toes throughout the fight.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
They have at times been really good under Gerrard, but they played under level.
Their endings lacked sharpness – only once they were exposed to the home team – and it is a quick awakening for Rangers, located in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue sky on Saturday (29 September), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
There has been disagreement over areas such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's rapprochements to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police held for security reasons a population of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but a lot of support appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – also took note and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German Government's decision to accept the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as a hero of some German Turks and mocked as an autocrat of others.
Accident on the way to Dectford: Cyclist dies in a collision with a car
A cyclist is dead in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred close to the cross between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwest part of the city around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and there were rescuers on site, but the man died on site.
The accident takes place a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car whose driver fled the site, on Children's Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said policemen were working on identifying the man and informing his relatives.
Roadblocks have been set up, bus routes have been refurbished and motorists are encouraged to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in unrest
Six prison officers have been injured in unrest in a high-security prison according to Prison Office.
There was unrest in the prison of HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9.30 BST Sunday, and the unrest is still under way.
Specialized Tornado officers have been brought in to handle the riots, involving eight inmates and taking place in one wing of the prison.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries on the spot.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: "Especially trained prison staff are deployed to deal with the ongoing unrest of HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are determined that those responsible are reported to the police and can end up spending longer time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison inspector was treated at the hospital after being attacked by an inmates.
And last October, unrest officers were invited to prison to deal with serious disturbances in which employees were attacked by billiard bullets.
The Orkan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm tide (major areas can benefit)
It is rare for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona, but it is most likely at the beginning of next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert landscape of the south-west United States and create a risk of storm tide.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings on storms for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, south-east California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones had maintained the status of a tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km of the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm of rain with isolated amounts up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin will probably get 25 to 51 mm with the option of 102 mm locally.
For those outside the risk of a storm flood, Rosa's rain can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will do useful because the south-west United States is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, the second highest category," reportsweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is expected to land on the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa still has hurricane strength Sunday morning with maximum wind force of 38 m/s and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves north by 19 km/h.
The storm meets cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore falls into strength.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with tropical current on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain across parts of Mexico can become strong and give great risk of flooding.
"A rainfall of 76 to 152 mm is expected from Baja California to the north-west Sonora with a possibility of up to 254 mm", reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the edge of Arizona early in the morning Tuesday as tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The primary expected danger from Rosa or the remains of it is very heavy rain in Baja California, the north-west Sonora and the south-west desert area of the United States," reported National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to create life - threatening storm tides and fluid falls in deserts as well as mountain landslides.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man are under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found in Somerset.
The teen boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 4 BST on Saturday.
He was brought to the hospital, where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man was arrested during the night in the Radstock area, says the police in Avon and Somerset.
Officers have called on anyone who may have mobile recordings of the incidents to arrive.
Trump says that Kavanaugh was under the "badness and anger" of the democratic party.
"A vote on Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the disrespectful and monstrous tactics of the democratic party," said Trump at a election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been subjected to the "badness, anger" of the democratic party throughout the process of nomination.
Kavanaugh gave a testimony in front of the Congress on Thursday and strongly denied and emotionally charged accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that he was sexual about her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a testimony at the hearing about his accusations.
The president said Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that confirms one of the most skilled legal brains in our time, a lawyer with a fantastic past in public service," he said to a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh, while he spoke of the importance of Republicans meeting in the polls at the mid-term elections.
"In five weeks there is one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
You can't vote for me, but you're actually voting for me," he said.
"That's why I travel around fighting for amazing candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats were on a mission to "strike against and block".
The first important procedure vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday, has a person highly located in the Republican party told CNN.
Several hundred killed by Indonesian earthquakes and tsunami, death rate growing
At least 384 were killed, and many of them washed away by huge waves that hit the beach when a great earthquake and a great tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, said authorities on Saturday.
Several hundred people were gathered to a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six feet [6 m] high waves hit the coast at the time of the twilight, sucked many in death, and destroyed everything on their way.
Tsunami emerged after an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the richer scale.
"When the tsunami war occurred yesterday, people were still working on the beach. They did not run right away and became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spoke of Indonesia's disaster response GDPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, the dragged cars, wooden trunks, houses, it hit everything on land," said Nugroho and added that the tsunami had moved through the open sea with 800 km/h before the hit coast.
A number of people managed to survive by climbing up trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The disaster preparedness has published aerial photographs showing many damaged buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Afterdønninger continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Board for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a announcement that the energy that was triggered during Friday's major earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb that was thrown over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and it may have made the tsunami larger, said the board.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found clamped under the rubble from collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been damaged and 29 reported missing.
Nugroho said that the death rate and the injuries could be larger along the 300 km long coastline north of Palu, the Dongaga area, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication "was completely paralysed without information" from Donggala, said Nugroho.
"There live over 300,000 here," said Red Cross in a announcement and added that their employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," they said.
The board of directors was criticized on Saturday from many fronts in order not to inform that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said that the waves had arrived within the time period during which the warning was issued.
In amateur scenes shared by social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building who desperately shouts warnings about the tsuami that comes closer to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a major power failure that cut off communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue effort.
The military has begun sending cargo aircraft with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, reporting authorities, but there is still a strong need for food and basic necessities among the evacuated.
The city airport has been reopened, but only for auxiliary work, and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centers in Palu Sunday.
The death rate after Indonesian tsunami is above 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have come safely to Palu city, where employees seek shelter during tarnishings set up in the courtyard at their account. They came past areas with extensive destructions on the road, said Dosaba.
"They told me they so many broken houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when relief organisations began working hard to restore the relief work, there was a complaint that foreign relief workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian legislation, financial support, supplies and staff from abroad must only enter if the area where the accident has occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for Indonesian red cross.
"When the government says 'OK, it is a national disaster', we can open up international assistance, but there is no status yet."
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing people held to hope that their closest ones would be the miracles that brighten the bleak tales of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled up by a sewer.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under a rubble for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandino, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders to Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other of those caught at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandai, were among his students.
"As a veteran in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who were in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, only resulted in one grey flybone instead of two blues.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he says.
Twenty takes USD 26,750 while filling up cash machines in Newport on the Living
Twenty stole on Friday morning 26.750 USD from a Brink's officer who was fulfilling a Newport on the Living machine, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran "up behind Brink's staff" and stole a bag of money that should have been delivered.
Witnesses saw more suspects fleeing the site, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
Everyone with information on the identity of the thieves, please contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing name to Ye.
He announced the shift Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote, "The water previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been named Ye for a while and used the name as the title of its eighth album, which was published in June.
The change takes place prior to his performance in Saturday Night Live where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces songs Ariana Grande at the show, which cancelled for "emotional reasons", said the show's creator.
The name is a abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance to him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier in the year when he discussed his album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused pages, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has changed between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former partners, JAY-Z, has also changed between lower and upper case letters and changed whether the dash is included.
Mexico's AMRO does not promise to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians, as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody restitution action against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "never would ever use the military to suppress the Mexican people."
troops shot at a peaceful demonstration on the spot on October 2, 1968, and killed up to 300 at a time when left-oriented student movements struck root in many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by granting monthly state grants to students and opening more free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities attract young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research within the field, says investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come, after various parts of the U.S. government has given releases of artificial intelligence. However, the United States still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced their plan last year and aims to take the lead in innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough within AI," said Lee.
The doubling of the budget could double the chances that the next major performance in artificial intelligence will be achieved in the United States, told Lee to CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is Managing Director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most outstanding artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that struck the highest ranking American Othello player, and later he became head of Microsoft Research and Director of Google's department in China.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions supported by the US government, such as Robotics Challenge, which was held by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition will come, so that the next visionary can be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to achieve legacies from the government, says Lee.
"It's not China that grabs the academic leaders, it's the big companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years employed star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think PhDs in artificial intelligence should have offered work permits automatically.
The Chinese Government issued their Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions in a way similar to the National Science Foundation and the distribution of money by other state organisations to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a joint centre of artificial intelligence to involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the foundation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests more than USD 100 million a year in research into artificial intelligence.
However, US legislation, which seeks to establish a national security commission for artificial intelligence, has been still for several months.
Makers shall vote on the amendment of the country's name.
The Macedonian people voted Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to the 'Republic of North Macedonia', an action that would solve a decades-old battle with Greece which has blocked Macedonia's attempts to achieve membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province named Macedonia and maintains that the name of their neighbouring country to the north constitutes a claim on Greek territory and has therefore used their veto when Macedonia has sought accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's primary Slavic population.
President Ivanov has said that he will not take part in the vote and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the voters will make up the 50% required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot was, "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price worth paying to create access to associations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that arose as a result of Yugoslavia's collapse.
"I came today to vote on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means more secure life for all of us," said Oliver Georgieva, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of this House have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote and do so.
The change in the name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said that at 13 a.m. there were no reports of irregularities.
However, the vote was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent at the last parliamentary elections in 2016, in which 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko took part in the vote in Macedonia on a change in its name, which would open up for membership of NATO and the EU, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Before Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and drew chairs up in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the vote.
"We are for NATO and the European Union, but we want membership with a panda, not the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn against others such as China and Russia and become part of the European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would provide a heavily needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will vote for because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the European Union and NATO," said Zaev after giving his vote.
He said that a "yes" result would be a "security of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters would take part in the vote – less than the required vote.
Another poll by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV indicated that 57 per cent of the respondents planned to vote Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the voting time must be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the prosecuting government since it took place in May last year.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero is fighting all over Brighton defense and scorer
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2.0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his scoring, which came after 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a delivery on the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly ran past three Brighton defenders before he snuck out on the open track.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He fought past one defender, and then ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a left hand delivery and found Sterling.
The English forward used its first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used its right boots to overlist Brighton goalman Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero struggles with some problems with his feet," told the City Manager Pep Guardiola reports.
"We talked about him playing about about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the immediate lead in the Premier League game.
That goal came after 29 minutes.
Aguero received in the sequence ball deep inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice delivery along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few contacts before he led Sterling towards the farthest post.
The Sky Blues forwards dashed the ball into the net just before it slipped past goals.
City fights Hoffenheim in the group game in Champions League at 12:55 Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to tease Rockies
Nationals are eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to take the castu on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still possibility of participation in playoffs for Rockies, which has played a fight more than Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies at least held in a wild-card square with a 5-2 victory over the National's Friday night, but still have their first division title for good.
"Although we have nothing to play for, we can go to the battle knowingly that the atmosphere would be at its highest level among the audience here in Denver and that the opponents would play at the probably highest level I will face this year.
Why shouldn't I be excited to play under those conditions?"
Nationals have not yet signed out the start-up to Sunday, but will probably put Scherzer in as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the spot for the 34th time, trained his cast Tuesday and wanted to pitch on Sunday, which is usually his rest day.
The Washington right-hand player is located on 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 barouts in 220 2/3 in this season.
Trump is holding an election meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republicans meeting up at the polls at the mid-term elections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
It's one of the big, big – you can't vote for me, but you're actually voting for me. That's why I'm traveling around fighting for amazing candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you can see it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all the means available. You can see how vicious, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they're hurting who they're going to run over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, but we don't want to give it to them."
The democrats, he said, have as mission "strit and block".
"And you've seen it over the past four days," he said, and called the democrats "worsy and evil, and disgusting and lying."
He referred to the chief democratic senator in the Senate Judiciary Committee, Diane Feinstein, by name, which triggered a loud bow from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, wait just – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a spacious party.
They are intolerant to those who express their views
When Momentum's activist in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't really a surprise.
I am just the latest in a large number of Members from Labour who have been told that we are not welcome – only because we have made our views known.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship went on to criticise me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically similar problems in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the invitation to the meeting in Nottingham East Labour on Friday, it said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Member, Friday evening's meetings have just been like this.
Today, unfortunately, the tone of many meetings is not so, and the promise of 'friendly, gentler' politics is far back in the past if it ever started.
It has become increasingly clear that divergent views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are weighed by whether the party's leadership can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues, whom I previously thought I shared politically, began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed to – whether it was a matter of national security or the EU's internal market.
When I say my opinion in the public – and that really doesn't matter what I say – a long striped message follows on the social media that calls for the rejection and contradiction of the middle-seeking policy and tells me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I have deep respect for professionalism and the willingness to fight among colleagues who, every day, are dying of sexism or racism, but still keep fighting.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is where normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour was going to create a tolerant culture.
But in reality it is no longer a spacious organization and with every motion of censure or change of selection rules the party becomes narrower.
I've been given plenty of advice over the last two years that if I lay on my own and I'm not so loud, I'll be fine.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I became a member of Labour 32 years ago, when I went to school, I was provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which had left our classroom in a declining state, and I put myself in order to create better public services for those who need it most – whether it has been as an agency member or as a minister of the government.
I've never hidden my policy either during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused about my political positions and disagreements with current management.
To those who made the motion for a resolution on Friday, I would say that when the country rushes towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of Labour.
But the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the local voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no form of threat of rejection or political suitability will keep me from acting on what I believe is your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatted Ayr becomes top team
Two late scorings may have got the final result to draw a not quite truthful picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this amazing entertaining match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard and are the only unbeatable team of ten.
In the end, it was just as much their superior defense as their better use of the chance that carried home, and Coach Peter Murchie had absolutely the right to be satisfied.
"Our battles have been demanding so far, and we are still unsailing, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Respect to Ayr, they took advantage of their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson’s scoring after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr in front, but a yellow card to the Scottish national team player Rory Hughes, who was awarded to the battle of the Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a scoring, which was not followed up by a kick.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a penalty park just before the half game. He scored and then got a solo cor ring, so there were 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson’s scoring, which was followed up by a kick from Baggot, reduced the score difference to five.
There was then a long interruption because Ruaridh Knott had a serious injury. He was brought out of the track on the stretcher. When the game was resumed, Ayr expanded the lead with a scoring from Stafford McDowall and a follow-up kick from Climo.
Funging Ayr director Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card, and again Melrose used their extra man with a scoring from Bruce Colvine without follow-up kick after a period of intense pressure.
The home team came again, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson could after a line-out score behind the protruding Ayr cluster.
Climo followed up with a kick within the poles and followed up with a more almost right after, the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe opened David Armstrong's box kick and sent the pilot Gregor Henry to the home track's fifth scoring.
Still Game star looking for new career in the restoration industry
Still Game-star Ford Kieran seems to take the step to the restaurant business after he found out that he has taken the director's post for an authorized restaurant business.
The 56-year-old is playing Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main person in together with his partner Greg Hemphil.
The duo has announced that the coming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Aktormorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on history, but a source suggested to Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"Havet is ours: the country of India Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen route to the Pacific
The sailors patrol around the Navy headquarters, which is housed in rains, in La Paz.
On public buildings there is a huge blue flag.
Navy bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are overpainted with the motto: "Havet is ours, it is a right.
It's a duty to take it back."
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of a coastline that was lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century is still strong, and the same is the longing to sail on the Pacific again.
The hopes may be at their highest for decades, while Bolivia awaits a judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of vote.
"Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and, of course, awaits with a positive look at the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country and hope that the Court of Hague will give Bolivia the support that Chile – after several decades of discussions – is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia sovereignty over an area of access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charistian native president, who is facing a controversial election campaign next year, also has a lot at stake in the judgment on Monday.
"We're close to returning to the Pacific," he promised last August.
But analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court of Justice will take Bolivia's party – and that there would be no major change if it did.
The UN Assembly, which has its seat in the Netherlands, does not have the power to hand over Chilean territory and has pointed out that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The judgment of the International Court only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have given back.
"The story of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership," said Zárate.
Morales' war rhetoric has made it rid of the remaining Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian representative of The Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making of the Court was abnormally rapid.
Monday Bolivia will be given "an extraordinary opportunity to open up a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end an era of 139 years of disagreement and benefit both parties", he said.
Mr Calzadilla also denied that Mr Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political crisis.
"Bolivia will never give up access rights to the Pacific", he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless they can rely on the United States
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never disarm their nuclear weapons if they cannot first trust Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with promises given during a Singapore Summit between the rival leaders.
His comments were extended by the fact that the US Foreign Minister, Mike Pompeo, appears to be facing a restart of the fast-locked nuclear diplomat over three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a "devil dream" that continued sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a declaration ending the Korean war will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to declare as long as Pyongyang has not only taken significant steps against disarmament.
Both Kim and American President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread scepticism in relation to whether Pyongyang is serious in relation to the abolition of an arsenal which the country most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month in preparation for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Modeshows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large headwear, which you will soon be able to buy in local shops
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne lifted the catwalk veiled for a collection of strangely large-size headwear as part of their SS19 collection. The collection impressed by Paris Fashion Week.
Very unpractical hats have dominated Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
The most impressive work from Valentino was a lavish with a featherlike wide shadow covering the heads of the models.
There were also other extra large accessories including watermelons with jewels and even an pineapple – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had paired lips that reminded more of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a snorkel and mask, and others resembled a melted waffle.
And if you continue the great fashion statements, you're lucky.
Spectators predict that the huge hats could come to shops near you.
The hats arrive in the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60 cm wide shadow, which is seen on all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark, which is behind the most unpractical hatred that was spread over the social media, has sent a new great creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw that is almost as large as the model that shows it.
The orange buttocks with bass freezes and a white leather handle was the most eye-catching in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in ordinary shops next summer. The designer has had such a great influence that it will be hard to ignore the demand for accessories in huge size."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have many great academic achievements behind them, and it has continued in 2018 with yet another number of outstanding examination results, which are also strengthened by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other local efforts.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their students and parents.
The independent schools try to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can put together and implement a tailor-made syllabus, we find that modern languages remain a popular topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it hits his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it hits his heart."
It is an important reminder that we cannot just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can look at the latest examination results this year that language is highest in statistics with most passed exams in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a high quality A.
The data collected by the 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of the students received the character A in mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French, and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important competences that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now perceived as a topic selection at the level of STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and maths) in independent schools' pensa and elsewhere.
A study carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that among the reasons why employers could not occupy vacancies, 17 % had a lack of language skills to do.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more important in preparing young people for their future careers.
More job opportunities will require language skills in the future, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career young people choose, if they have learned another language, they have a great advantage in the future with a life-long skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a lead to the competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 respondents in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 per cent could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 per cent.
That is why it is important to invest in language learning for those who are children today.
When you can speak more languages, especially languages from developing countries, children give a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, there are differences between schools in which languages are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be the most important for the United Kingdom when looking forward to 2020, e.g. mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose from at independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to delivering a learning environment that prepares children and provides them with the skills required to succeed regardless of what the future offers.
At present, it cannot be denied that language continues to be really important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this distinction to Scotland's youth.
Il faut been le faire.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron gets debut for Laker's Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost over for fans who will watch LeBron James play his first game for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers Coach Luke Walton has announced that James is playing in the Sunday opening game before the season start against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not yet determined how many minutes he's playing.
"It will be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James probably won't play the whole game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans in relation to Lakers' scheduled six matches before the season start.
"Where I'm in my career I don't need to fight before the season starts to get ready," he said.
Trumps election meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a stripe election meeting tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five scheduled election meetings next week, including meetings in Trump friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on the confirmation of the appointed judge of Trump to the vacant seat of the Supreme Court is suspended, Trump tries to provide support for the upcoming mid-term elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when the votes are cast in November.
When is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trumps election meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia is held at midnight (Danish Time) the night between Saturday 29 November and Sunday 30 November 2018.
You can see the Trumps election meeting in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely speak of this week’s hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as Supreme Court. The hearings were tense because of charges for sexual abuse, and the expected vote in the Senate on confirmation has been suspended for a week, while the FBI is investigating the charges.
But the primary objective of this strip of election meetings is to create momentum for the Republicans who are facing a difficult election in November.
People from President Trump's campaign team said that the five election meetings next week are aimed at "creating energy among volunteers and supporting when Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Controversy over Congress is so important to his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible now that we enter the busy campaign time," said a spokesperson for the Trump campaign, which would not be quoted by name, to Reuters.
The evening's election meeting is held in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month, Trump has visited West Virginia, the state, he won with over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisy, who is behind in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisy that the President has to step up to give him a boost in his polls," said Simon Hader, who is involved in state science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team U.S. has shown a battle mission and is trying to keep hope alive before Sunday's single dolls
After three one-sided rounds, Saturday's four-man dolls might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging moment round pentul is a fully invented sports concept, but a concept that players believe in – not least in competitions like this one.
Where would they say that is momentary now?
"They led with six points, and now it's four, so we'll probably see it a little bit as momentary," said Jordan Spieth, before he was four o'clock.
Europe has of course the advantage: they are 4 points ahead, and there are 12 more points to play over.
As Spieth says, however, Americans feel that they have little wind in the sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and both boast with three points of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The high cheers became higher as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important cushion, which secured victory in duel four, although he and Thomas had been two punches behind after two duels.
His cushion, which secured them the battle of Hole 15, was met with a similar scream – the kind of scream that shows that he does not believe the American team is out of competition yet.
"You just have to find the inner strength and focus on your own fight," said Spieth.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, no doubt the greatest story from Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange, yet sympathetic couples have got four points in four battles and appear flawless.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't get a booky Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the booky's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way the energy appears to flow both to and from the wild audience show that it is them that it will be the hardest to beat Sundays. And it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory were caught by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
It's always synchronically on each of their holes.
It is, however, too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process against Sergio Garcia, the morning in the four-man duels when he formed couples with Alex Noren.
A booky and two double books on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swede down into a hole they were never near to getting out of.
No one can help you out of your hole on Sunday.
The struggles with four balls and two teams a two players are so fascinating to look closely at the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and the way the strategy can quickly change.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a significant lead before the last day, but the four-man dolls have also shown that Team United States has the struggle that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe creates lead on 10-6 before the last day in Ryder Cup
Europe has a great advantage before the last day at Ryder Cup, after they came out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a lead over the United States of America of 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two victories over a troubley Tiger Woods and have so far received four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, trying to win the bag they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an unprecise American team in the morning fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The United States gave more resistance in foursomes, they won four battles, but they were still behind.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12 single games if they're to keep the bag.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant who has won four points in a row, and he and Molinari who together have got the nickname "Molliwood" is after a sensational weekend the only other couple in Ryder Cup's history who have won four points in their first four matches.
They crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then elegantly defeated a counter-solved Woods and the American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5/4.
Woods, who fought through the first two games on Saturday, had little brilliant glimpses, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well rested for the morning fourballs and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes and got a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – which is number three in the world.
However, Europe has it quite, as they wish, on a lightly windy day southwest of Paris.
Three major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way to the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard fought 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later returned and hit Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the Ryder Cup story that a team has fought back after being behind with four points before the single games. Since Furyks currently has the bag, however, they must only achieve the impasse to keep it.
However, having been second best for two days, it seems that they cannot master a counterattack Sunday.
North Korea says that they will not disarm unilaterally if there is no confidence
The Secretary of State of North Korea told the United Nations Saturday that continued sanctions strengthen their mistrust of the United States and that it will not give up their nuclear weapons unilaterally under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the World General Assembly that North Korea had shown “substantial goodwill” in recent years, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, settling an area for nuclear tests and not promising further development of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"But we haven't seen a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no trust in our national security and under such conditions there is no chance that we will take the first step and disarm unilaterally."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phase divided" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps. However, his speech seemed important since it did not unequivocally reject unilateral disarmament, as it has otherwise been the case from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint announcement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a seated US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work "atomic disarmament on the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the Korean war, which took place in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown opposition to bleeding up against sharp international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on nuclear disarmament first" and extends the pressure of sanctions to achieve their purpose by coercion and even opposes the declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a wishful dream among people who don't know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions strengthen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention any plans for a summit further between Kim and Trump, which the American leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If nuclear disarmament were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so locked up."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ris's speech was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the launch of North Korea's rockets against mainland America was inevitable, after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened the United Nations with "total destruction" of North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for showing courage in relation to disarmament, but said that there is still a lot to be done and that the sanctions have to remain until North Korea detoxifies.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a timetable for these actions, but said, "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council must maintain sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve the total, final, certified nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased financial sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons programme.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sideline at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, while North Korea only a few hours later accused him of making "goalful demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile system and a nuclear complex if the United States took "the corresponding steps."
He said that Kim had told him that the "equivalent steps", he demanded, were the security promises that Trump gave in Singapore, as well as movements towards normalizing the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard take the course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all bachelor students more sleep. The aim of the course is to counter the growing macho culture where you study all night held up by large amounts of caffeine.
One researcher has shown that students at the world's best universities often don't know the first thing about caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, who is professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has made the course, which, he thinks, is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was given the idea to the course after giving a presentation on the effects of lack of sleep on learning.
"When the paper was finished, a girl came up to me and said, "Why do I get to know this first when I'm on the candidate?"
"She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is offered for the first time this year, explains how good sleep habits can improve your academic and sporting performance as well as your overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University's Health Area, says that the University has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in serious sleep shortages during the week.
The hourly course consists of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises there is a picture of a college room where students must click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how one's sporting performance is affected by sleep shortages and how important sleeping habits are.
In another part of the course the participants hear about how sleep deficiency increases the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression and cancer over a long time.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map of campus.
"We know that it will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride of taking an 'allnight' still exists, he says and adds that modern technology and increased pressure on students have led to that sleep deficiency is a growing problem.
The "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue and anxiety is good and sufficient sleep, he said – it also counteracts weight gain, because sleep loss makes the brain think that you starve why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California studying chemical and physical biology, last year, Professor Czeisler helped organize the course when he took one of his first year courses at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and made him work on making it a general course at all universities.
He hopes that the next will be that all graduates will be offered a similar course before they continue their education.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm so that they know when to go to bed and when to get up. This can create awareness of the harmful effects of the light from electronic monitors, which can move at circadian rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga targets lower Gerrard and co.
Rangers suffered another defeat on the outskirts, when Dolly Mengas's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's incoherent team had to go to thank for a defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was after their first victory on the outskirts since the 4-1-triumfen at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holts team gave Gerrard the only second defeat in 18 battles that train. Thus, there are eight points up to the Hearts at the first place of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Ranger team could not respond to.
Rangers now smoke down to a sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to a third place after Hibernian with only the goal score of difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to Rangers, as Line Judge Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head by a thrown object that looked like coming from the outskirts section.
Gerrard made eight changes in the layout that reached Betfed Cup's semifinal by tons of Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, served with the same 11, who barred a point of Heart's conduct last week, and he would have been delighted to see his sharp team fatigued the opponents all over the track.
Rangers had the ball the most, but Livingston was more efficient.
They should have scored two minutes in the fight when Menga's initial delivery sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but the midwayer's attempt was over.
A free kick in the depths of Keaghan Jacobs found his way to Captain Craig Hallkett, but his defense player Alan Lithgow kicked past the rear pole.
The Rangers, however, took control, but played more on the hope than the ability of the attacker.
Alfredo Morales was not at least satisfied when Judge Steven Thomson denied the columbian's appeal for a penalty park, when he and Steven Lawless went down together after a quarter of a game.
Rangers managed only two shots on target in the first half, but the former Rangers target Liam Kelly did not have any problems with Lassana Coolibaly's headfall and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
Although the opening of Livis in the 34th minute was something random, it must be said to be deserved for their efforts alone.
Again, Rangers couldn't handle a deathball situation in depth from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took time to find Menga who could easily kick it in his sight.
In the break Gerrard Coolibary replaced with Ryan Kent, which almost instantly gave the pot when the pilot sent the ball in to Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the crowd to play on their points with many long balls up the track from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have expanded the lead in the last part of the fight, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with a safe hand before Lithgow headed next to goals.
Rangers' depositor Glenn Middleton again appealed for a late penalty park after drying with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked here the other way.
Yearbook: The Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the yearbook "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today – if we TELLE... – was the day when the future physicist John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that would eventually lead to the apparatus known as the geiger counter.
The geiger counter has become a permanent component of both science and popular culture, as it could be seen in the film "Bells of Coronado" from 1950, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans had the main roles of peasant scientists:
Man, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals is doing."
Evans, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
"His" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have filled 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then "see" the protein that is common to many cancers and where they are injected again
A test vaccine lasts promisingly in patients with a variety of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from patients and changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein named HER2, which many cancers have, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "gets several cancers to develop", including breast, ovary, lung and intestinal cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells out of patients and "learning" them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go well.
After an inconsistent performance in the Saturday Night Live Study, Kanye West was arched by when he praised the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and said that he himself would set up as a presidential candidate in 2020.
When he had played last night's third song Ghost Town wearing a Make America Great Again case, he began on a duel against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
"I talk so often to white people who say, 'Why do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
But if I was concerned about racism, I would have long since moved from the United States," he said.
SNL started the evening show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Legal Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's assault charges.
Even though the recordings were not shown, the comedian Chris Rock Wests tethered on the social media.
It is uncertain whether Rock was trying to exhibit West by putting up the footage.
West also complained to the audience about poor treatment backstage due to his headwear.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hat on.'
They bullied me!
And they said I was sunk deep," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how deep I am sunk?" and said that he would take on his Superman coat because it means that "you can't decide what to do. Do you want to make progress in the world?
Try with love."
The audience Buhede at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff seemed to be embarrassingly touched, reports Variaty with a comment from a person who was present: "There was a rebound in the study."
West had been booked as replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose girlfriend then rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many by acting with the song I Love It while he was dressed out as a Perrier bottle.
West received the support of the head of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: TAKE NOT TO DO YOU DO YOU BUE OF THE PEAT."
Talkshow-host Karen Hunter tweeted that West just "is as he is, and that's fine."
"But I do NOT choose to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his "art") who embraces and publishes an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And so have we," she added.
Before the show the rapper had announced that he has taken name change to "entity that is officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist who has changed his name, and so follows Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The Rapcollege Snoop Dogg has been called Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased musical Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.

The opinions shall be reviewed by the public prosecutor.
Game of the Thrones star Kit Harington extends for toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for swinging swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval-fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor goes after the stereotypical macho hero and says that such TV characters mean that young men often feel that they must be hard to be respected.
Kit said to Sunday Times Culture that he believes that something has gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie on 31, admitted that the problem lies to him "very in mind".
"For the time being, I am very concerned – where have we gone wrong in the city with masculineity?" he said.
"If we look at the current problems, what is it that we have learned young men in their growth?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to the very masculin characters.
He went on to say, "What's inborn, and what's your business?
What is it that young men learn from television and on the street that makes them feel that they should be men in this way?
I think it is one of the great questions of our time – how do we change that?
For it is obvious that something has gone wrong for the young men."
During the interview he also admitted that he will not make successors to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer and said that he is "over with battlefields and horses".
Kit is involved in re-recording Sam Shepard's True West from November, the story of a film director and his brother, a thief.
The shooter recently revealed that he considers it to have met his wife Rose as the best at the whole Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so in this way it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kit's character, Jon Snow, is in love with the Emmy Award winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has published a 14% increase in the number of people with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, says the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China because of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people receiving HIV in this way has been reduced to something near zero, Chinese health authorities say at a conference in Yunnan province.
In one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalised, but discrimination against LGBT individuals is reported to be a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men having sex with other men marry before or since with women because of the country's conservative values.
Many cases of infection are due to the lack of prevention in these circumstances.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff leaked data about Republican Senators and resorts to "hazardous lies" and "conspiratory theories"
Member of the Representatives' House Maxine Waters denied on Saturday's accusations that a member of her staff has shared personal information about three Republican Senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The democracy of Los Angeles claimed that the allegations were from websites and support from "the extreme right wing".
"Lews, lies and more terrible lies," wrote Waters in a Twitter poster.
The published information contained supposedly home addresses and telephone numbers of the US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday on the web by an unknown person on Capitol Hill. It happened during a hearing in the Senate about negotiating accusations for sexual assault against the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support pages such as Gateway Pundit of RedState announced that IP addresses pointed out that the information had been posted by Waters' people, and then they published information about a member of the Waters staff, says The Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie," continued Waters.
"The membership of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, is in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie."
Waters' printing quickly received criticism online, including from former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer.
"It's an angry denial," wrote Fleischer.
"This indicates that she doesn't have the right temperament to be a congressman.
If you're accused of something you haven't done, don't get angry.
You can't get mad.
You don't have to question the prosecutor's motives.
You have to keep your senses."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, which was criticized to be too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to take over Waters' place in the mid-term elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Large, if that's true," he tweeted.
In Waters' official announcement, she says that her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and the order authority regarding these fraudulent claims."
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are found," she continued. "And that they will be held legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone and everyone in my staff."
Review of Johnny English strikes again – overwhelming spy comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all recent films with a British ice sheet, and it also seems relevant for the latest action comedy English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English.
Will dry, sarcastic self-satiers, if we are concerned, become the country's new export potential?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and the big eyes have been allowed to re-create the roarers again. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comic finding directed at places where cinema visitors do not speak English.
He is, of course, the tumulty secret agent who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a bit of Clouseau, a knife tip Mr. Bean and a proper cloth of him who performed a single tone to the Chariots of the Fire song at the opening ceremony of the Olympics in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the worldwide and international lukewarm bulls that left chaos in their wake of Atkinson portraying him in Barclaycard's television advertising.
There are some good moments in this latest shot at the tribe of JE.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the propellers clinged to his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comedy, but the sense of humor feels rather overwhelming and strangely redundant, especially now when more "serosive" series like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer convincing comedy as an ingredient.
The Humor seems to be targeted at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy adventure is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film fjolleries in the role of Mr. Bean.
The infinitely current starting point for the film is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An internet picker has infiltrated England's top secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the English agents in the field to the horror of the responsible agent – a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for a pompous and combatable Prime Minister who already suffers a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the manuscript.
When her security advisers inform her that every active spy has been exposed, she is required to cancel someone's pension.
And of course it's the smart Johnny English, who is now a school principal at a high school, but who in hiding teaching on how to become a secret agent. There are some funny sequences here when English stands for a kind of School of Rock training in espionage.
English is urgent back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunited with its hard tried former right hand Bough, which is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now been married to an overenthous but well-meaning submerged – a role played by Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the royal intelligence service's omage of Batman and Robin remains when they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is stumbled close to being entangled by the charismatic and monstrous tech-billardary Jason Volta – the game of Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England's computer problems.
English and Bough start their furiously risky escapades: disguised as servants they set fire to a distinguished French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English creates pure Âok as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with Volta's house.
All the cannons are fired in the final sequence of the film, but no matter how well-meaning and energetic it is, there is a sense of child television over it.
Pretty mediocre.
And as I couldn't help thinking with the other Johnny English movies: Can't the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that gives his talent justice?
Labour refuses to budge with a plan for four-day working week with an unaltered salary to the British
Jeremy Corbyn Labour is said to consider a radical plan, so that the English can focus on a four-day week of work, but get paid for five.
The party will supposedly have business leaders to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give employees an extra day off.
That would mean that the employees would have three days' weekend without going down wages.
Sources say that the idea would be consistent with the party's economic objective of drawing the country in a more favourable direction for the workers.
Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party said to The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published before the end of the year."
"It is not going to happen in one day, but a four-day week of work is a goal that fits the party's approach to changing the economy to the benefit of the workers and to the party's overall strategy for industry."
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the election campaign for the parliamentary elections in 2017.
However, the aim is not supported unanimously in the Labour Party.
One official of the Labour Party said: "A four-day week is not the policy of the party and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour's shadow finance minister John McDonnell spent last week's party meeting drawing up his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell states that he is determined to take power back from "anonymous directors" and "exploitations" in supply companies.
The shadow finance minister's plans also raise doubts as to whether the current shareholders of water supply companies will get their money back, as a government with Labour at the head could "return" them in the light of immoral actions.
He also confirmed plans to get employees in company boards and to create including ownership funds, which are to distribute 10 percent of private companies' share value to employees who are to receive up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh can change their voice
The FBI investigation of accusations against the judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and it raises the question whether the FBI finds could cause the Republican Senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that was shown on Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelly asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could dig something out that could make them change their attitude.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened – after the accusations came out – and said, "Did you do it?"
He was steel-shaped, definite and unambiguous."
Graham’s voice, on the other hand, seems to be escalated in stone.
"I've decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and other things would require a very violent accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett strongly denied it," added Graham with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I can't see it would change anything."
What is Global Citizen's Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York host city for the Global Citizen Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive offer of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end the world's poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival will, for the seventh time, receive tens of thousands of people at Central Park’s large lawn, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will draw attention to the real goal, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international interest organisation that fights to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concert guests have to perform a number of tasks or "actions". For example, volunteering, writing to a world leader, making a phone call or another meaningful action that can bring attention to the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been, now that they have 12 years to reach the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert real change, or is it just another case of "clicktivism" – i.e. people feel that they make a difference by signing a online signature collection or making a Twitter posting?
Global Citizen states that since 2011 they have registered more than 19 million "actions" from their members aimed at different objectives.
They believe that these actions have encouraged world leaders to set binding objectives and policies that are equivalent to more than 37 billion dollars, which by 2030 are expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 targets and actions that had become available because of their actions, which ran up to over $10 billion, which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that these funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main objectives is The Power of Nutrition, which has started in England and is a collaboration between investors and strong persons. They strive to "help children to survive their full potential" and promise 35 million dollars to remedy nutrition problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the English government, donors, other governments and world citizens like you, the social injustice with malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books," said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the UK Government has now promised funds to improve nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 online calls. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with nutrition advice.
In response to one of the website's frequently asked questions that read: "What makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen wrote: "It will be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we will stumble and make mistakes.
But like the movement of civil rights and the movement against Apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performances at this year's festival in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman must be hosts.
The United States can use its fleet to "block" Russian energy exports, says the US Minister for Interior
"If necessary" Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from coming to the market, also in the Middle East, reveals the US Minister of Interior, Ryan Zinke, to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially where they are operating on an invitation from the rightful government – is a pretext to expand the sale of their energy.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"The United States, with our fleet, has the opportunity to ensure that there is free passage on the sea roads and, if necessary, we can also block them so that we ensure that their energy does not get on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting held by the Consumer Energy Alliance – a non-profit organisation that regards itself as "the voice of the US energy consumer" –.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and said that they are essentially the same.
"The economic opportunities in relation to Iran and Russia are about using and replacing fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony", whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come after the Trump administration has aimed at increasing European exports of liquid natural gas to replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
To achieve this, spokesmen of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 management project which, according to Trump, has made Berlin the "capture".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion expensive North Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is solely an economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of unequal conditions of competition and is simply due to economic considerations.
"I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose the supplier," said the Russian minister of energy, Aleksandr Novak, at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with the US minister of energy, Rick Perry, in September.
The position of the Americans meets with criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the BDI, has asked the United States to interfere outside the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a major problem with the involvement of a third party in our energy supply," said the head of BDI, Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between the German chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" to stand for the Presidential elections in 2020, says the Senator of Massachusetts
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" to present the presidential elections after the mid-term election, she said on Saturday.
At an agency meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering setting up.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it takes a woman to the front," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I would like to think seriously about setting up the presidential elections."
Warren gave his opinion of President Donald Trump during the city council and said that he "moved the country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing about our democracy," she said.
Warren has been pronounced in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh.
On a two-day Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course, the FBI has to investigate the case before the vote."
However, a poll from Thursday shows that most of Warren's own backland does not think she should set up in 2020.
According to a poll by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not present.
32% supported the possible candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick by 38% and 48% against a possible settlement.
Other high-profile democratic candidates discussed in the presidential elections in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden states that he announces his final decision in January, writing Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palins PTSD at a election meeting for Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through after he's come home means that I can relate to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers return to home," she told the audience to a Trump selector Meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in space" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and become harder; they go and think about whether there is respect for it, their colleagues on land and in the air and all the other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was accused of domestic violence against a woman, to prevent the reporting of domestic violence and to possess a drunk weapon, says Dan Bennet, a spokesperson of the Wasillas police.
18 States and D.C. support opposition to new asylum laws
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal objection against a new US law refusing asylum to victims who flee from gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. delivered a partial independent declaration on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who opposes the law, says NBC News.
The applicant's full name in Grace vs. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union submitted in August against the federal law, has not been published.
She states that her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" had abused her, but American officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of American asylum seekers are tribes, as countries with far-reaching problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum legislation rejected a decision of the US Foreign Affairs Board in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District of Columbia's State Attorney, Karl Racine, stated on Friday that the new law "is missing from the state, federal and international laws of decades."
"The federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be decided on in the light of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle", states the Party Independent Declaration.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the Act on Rejection of Immigrants harms the American economy, since there is a higher likelihood that they will become self-employed and "provide the necessary labour."
In June, Prime Minister Jeff Session's immigration magistrates took the right to grant asylum to victims who flee from domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asyl is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political standing," said Sessions in his decree of the Law of 11 June.
It has never been intended that asylum should remedy all problems – or just all serious problems – that people throughout the world are facing every day.
While the death rate is doubled, the attempts to find survivors in Palu are desperate.
For survivors, the situation only got worse.
"It's very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her little fevery boy at an evacuation center in the destroyed town of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes in with bodies.
We need clean water."
The inhabitants now returned to their broken homes to sort in soft property and save what they could find.
Several hundred people were injured, and hospitals, also affected by the quake of 7.5, could not follow.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were outside of the Palus military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to heavy backslashes.
He had tears in his eyes when he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room in the fifth floor, he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There wasn't time to save ourselves.
I got hit against a broken wall, I think," said Haris to Associated Press and added that his family was going to a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife yelled for help, but then there remained still.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of unfine methods and propaganda ads
One week after a Chinese newspaper brought a four-page ad in an American newspaper that hit the drum for the benefits of American-Chinese cooperation, the American ambassador in China blames for using the American press to spread propaganda.
The American President, Donald Trump, referred Wednesday to China Daily’s deposit in Des Moines Register – Iowa’s best selling newspaper – after accused China of mixing in November 6th Congress elections. China rejects the accusation.
US officials state to Reuters that Trump's accusation of Chinese interference in the US elections marks a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to announce to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked up in an escalating trade war where they have in several cases imposed duties on each other's imports.
China's duty of return in the trade war was to be imposed on exporters in countries such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, means Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, American ambassador in China, for a number of years in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural food to China, said that Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a leader of the Sunday Des Moines Register that China "compresses the use of the unfine methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government uses the proud American tradition of freedom of speech and press freedom by running a paid ad in Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"On the other hand, in the kiosks here in Beijing, there will only be few votes against, and you will not get a fair picture of the Chinese people's differing views on China's worrying economic direction, as the media are under strict control by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers did not publish" his article even though he did not say which.
Republicans alienate women before the mid-term Kavanaugh case, warning analysts
While many top Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh against accusations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that they will experience a counter-reaction in the upcoming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The case has put the feelings into motion, and most Republicans have already announced that they would like to see the voting process continue.
"This cannot be done again," said Grant Reher, professor of State Science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article on Saturday.
Reher said he doubted that Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona)'s request for an FBI investigation for 11 hours will relieve angry voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday – they don't forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to The Hill on Friday.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators shouted during a demonstration in the Senate: "November comes!" when the Republicans who control the Legal Affairs Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, says Mic.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach new heights," told the independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg to the news media.
"People say it's already reached a high level; that's right.
But it can be even higher, especially among female swingers in the suburbs and younger voters – 18-29 – who rarely vote, despite not being in favour of the president."
Even before Ford's public accusations of the sexual abuse of the Supreme Court no longer exist, analysts had pointed out that it could give back if the Republicans continued the nomination.
"It has become worse for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the committee's vote or the final outcome, or whether Kavanaugh is responsible; it is also about how the Republicans have dealt with this and how they have dealt with her," points Guy Cecil, chairman of the Priorities United States – a group that supports Democrats in being elected – to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to have shared views on who they should believe in after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, where the latter have a little more on their side.
A new opinion poll by YouGov shows that 41% of those questioned definitely or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed that Kavanaugh was either probably or certainly lying during his testimony, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
At the request of Flake, the FBI is now investigating the accusations presented by Ford and at least another, says Deborah Ramirez for The Guardian.
Last week, Ford told the Senate Legal Committee last week that Kavanaugh was fully assaulting her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court Nomination showed her her genders at a party when they both studied at Yale in the 80s.
The Internet Explorer plans to make a new internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, launches a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The state-of-the-art project is Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners Lee said that the plan with Inrupt is "the world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start-up company.
"It's an historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology so people can make their own "personal online data collection" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data collection is that it is up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to gather resources, processes and capabilities to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contracts and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps by using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook or Google about whether they should change everything completely, so that all their business models suddenly become redundant."
"We don't ask for their permission."
Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupts "mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new internet built on Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next period of the Internet," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: A real receiver of the Victoria Cross of World War I is hailed
The only priest of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross by fighting during World War I is celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Wonn won the order on 29 September, 1918, during the attack by Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and never was told that he had won the highest English military order.
Last Saturday a memorial was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Van, one of his grandchildren, said that it was "incredible symbolic", that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's order winning achievement.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann of 29 September 1918 led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from machine guns and artillery."
He later ran to the front line and led with the "greatest man" of his people before attacking only an artillery and unharmed three cannons.
Lieutenant Water was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van at 72 said that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother James Water also laid down a wreath after the parade, which was listed by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said that he "felt very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people emphasizes the true heroism."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead got Gurli Gris
Imagine that you've been up all night to see the star-packed Bellator 206 and then are denied to see the main event.
There were 13 games on the program from San Jose, including six games on the main program, and they were shown the night through in England at Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to meet each other, the viewers in England became somewhat surprised when the transmission changed to show the Gurri Gris.
Some were unimpressive after they had stayed awake until the morning for this particular fight.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to a child care film as "a sort of sick joke."
"In accordance with the legislation, this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m., why they had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's seniority president when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Grisen Gulli, yeah."
Bellator's CEO, Scott Coker, said they will work on including English viewers in the planning future.
"When we think about the retransmission, I think we can make it work," said Coker.
"But the clock is six Sunday morning over there, and we will not find a solution to it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I was changed, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, and we thought it was a technical mistake.
But that was actually the law.
I promise you this won't happen next time.
We only had five games instead of six, as we normally do, and we tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had "less dignity" over sexuality
The Olympic divers Tom Daley says that he felt less worth than everyone in his childhood because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said it didn't happen to him until he got into the larger classes that "all isn't like me."
When he was at Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about homosexual rights to give others "hop."
He also said that he went less into winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The usual host of the radio show that has been running for a long time, Kirsty Young, has taken off a few months because of illness.
Daley was a guest in Laverne's first program and said that he felt "less worth" than everyone in his childhood because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "Until today, the feelings of feeling worth the memory and feeling different are the things that have given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they learned his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze winner has become a highly profiled LGBT champion and used its participation at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for a decriminalisation of homosexuality in several countries.
He said that he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live open without any negative consequences and he would give others hope.
The triple world champion said that he had become "surreptitious", when he fell in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Dr. Daley married last year with the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but told me that the difference in age had never been a problem.
He told me that it is hard to find someone at the same age who has experienced similar up and downs when you go through so much at such a young age – he went to his first OL at 14 years of age, and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June, the couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Dalley, and Daley said that "his whole perspective" had changed."
"If you'd asked me last year, it would be all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 as 40 years after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley told me that his father did not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had received tickets for London in 2012 – when he would sit on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there at that time.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and it first went up to me that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead," he said.
In the following year, Daley participated in the Olympic Games in 2012 and won bronze.
"I just knew that was what I had dreamed of my whole life – to dive in front of a home republic by the Olympics. There was nothing that could beat that feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration of his first song selection – Proud of Heather Small – which had meant a lot during the run-up to the Olympics and still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Unsharp Mickelson on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
American Phil Mikkelson sets a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th fight in Ryder Cup, but he must do something about the shape if it should not be a sad milestone.
Mikkelson, who records for the 12th time in the competition, which is settled every 2 years, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk due to Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of events for the United States as usual, the five - double grand winner had to act luckyly and practice his game in the hope of correcting the faces.
Even at the career's peak he had the most equal drive, why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match to the track at Le Golf National, where the long rough often punishs lost shots.
And if the track wasn't big enough mouthful, then at the ninth battle on Sunday, the always precise winner of British Open Francesco Molinari, who has joined with the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who start the 12 single games start hard, the Mikkelson fight can be decisive.
Furyk expressed no surprising faith in his teammate.
"He understood his role completely today, gave me a break on my back, put his arm around me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a great faith in himself."
He is in Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams in the past – and also this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought he'd have to play more, but that's how it went, and that's how it should be.
He wants to be out there like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson beats Nick Fallo's record for most games played in Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup careers that have never completely been able to match themselves with his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven impasse, although Furyk said that his presence contributes with something indefinable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, wise, he likes to run to people, and he's good to have in the teamroom," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than just the game."
Europe's Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that great travel can quickly disappear
The European Captain Thomas Bjørn knows from experience that solid conduct before the last day of Ryder Cup's single show can quickly become nervous.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points above the Americans, but was just getting caught before the finish with a victory of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice lead in Valderrama, we had a nice lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we only just won", says Bjorn after watching the 2018 team win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday for a total lead of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team it's not over.
It's supposed to be full of trash tomorrow.
Go out and do everything right.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal and it is to try to win the trophy, and that is where our focus lies.
I have always said that I am focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we are also aware of what is on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Enjoyed his players' performances on a hard course added Bear: "I'm not taking any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow it is the individual performances that count, and it is something quite different.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it goes well, but when you're out there alone, you're tested on all the parameters like a golfer.
That's what the players need to understand – get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, because he also has to get the best out of himself."
And it looks like the opponent Jim Furyk, hoping for better individual performances than in the partner game with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk has himself experienced contradictions in the last day. First on the winning team in Brookline before he lost when Europe made the "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every word," he said when he was asked how captain Ben Crenshaw had spoken to his players in 1999 before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but one would like to have a good start, as one saw at Brookline, as one saw at Medinah.
When momentum has found a direction, it puts great pressure on the middle struggles.
We put together our team in relation to it and put the players on the track in the order we feel for. We try to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the retreat and faces Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it ensures us all the way through," said Bjorn about his choice of single players.
Germany’s new warship is being postponed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War. However, the Germans must wait at least a year yet due to technical problems and an escalating price, writing local media.
The deployment of the largest ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been postponed to the first half of 2019 according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a spokesperson from the military.
The ship should have become part of the fleet in 2014, but delivery problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, will replace the aged frigats from the Bremen class.
They know that they want a powerful cannon, a wide range of anti-air and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the latest fragats is a minor need for maintenance: it should be possible to have the frigats away from home ports for up to two years.
However, the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which are supposed to cause Germany to appear as an overseas power factor – will already be obsolete when introduced, says Die Zeit.
The failed F125 Fregat created headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to use the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the fleet delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Not much was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of crucial "software and hardware errors", which made the warship useless in combat situations.
Software errors were of particular importance when ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are to be controlled by a crew of 120 sailors – that is only half of that crew from the older Bremen fighters.
It also turned out that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and reduced its capacity for future updates.
The 7000 tons of heavy "Rheinland-Palatinate" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware errors, the price of the project that includes training the crew is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a fainting 3,1 billion € ($3.6 billion), with an initial price of €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's fleet power is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the German Government Defence Committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet "is running out of deployment ready ships."
The official said that the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of service without being replaced.
He regretted that none of the Freegats from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust snigly listener to the secret life of bats
New research from an area in the highlands of Scotland is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and will help in the work on future conservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland following ordinary bats, dwarf bats, long-earned bats and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment shall be located in carefully selected locations in the area to record the activities of bats over the season.
Data are also collected by NTS personnel and volunteers using handheld detectors.
In-depth analysis of the sound recordings will reveal the frequencies of the bats and show which species does what.
To produce a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour, a report and a map of the habitat are made.
Natural conservation adviser for NTS Rob Dewar hopes that the results reveal which areas of the habitat is most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help to determine the benefits of habitat conservation efforts such as the establishment of meadows and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and Britain has fallen dramatically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect shipowners and reduce their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger, as can fly traps, chemical treatment of building materials, and infestations from pets.
In fact, bats are not blind.
But because they mainly hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use advanced echolocation techniques to find insects and fly around obstacles.
NTS, which is responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect nests and sometimes do rescue operations.
The organisation has even made Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reservation at the Threave area in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten of Scotland's bats.
The manager of the area, David Thompson, says that it is an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Treave we have a very good area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitat.
There's a lot you don't know about bats, so the work here and elsewhere can help to understand what they need to thrive."
He stresses the importance of looking for bats before performing maintenance tasks on properties, as the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and young people, thereby eliminating an entire local population.
Flagermus is protected and it is illegal to kill, bother or disturb them or their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project manager of Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to give a hand.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we have, we don't know how the populations evolve."
Ronaldo refuses rape charges, while lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape charges against him "fake news" and says that people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers prepare to sue the German news media Der Spiegel, who brought the accusations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rapeing an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he paid her $375,000 to keep it secret, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
Some hours after the claims had been published, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticized the information to be "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-fold winner of Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"They will promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man, and everything is good," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel because of the accusations, as they say Reuters has called "an unforgivable publication of suspicions of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player would seek compensation for "moral corruption in a class similar to the accusation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The event was reportedly taking place in June 2009 in a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After seeing each other at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room where he must have raped her anal according to the submitted report in the City Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said that he was "a good guy 99% of the time" gripped by "one percent".
The case papers claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her photograph photographed at a hospital, but that she later agreed to an agreement outside the court because she felt "bang for restitution" and worried about being "publicly damaged".
The 34-year-old now says that she will overthrow the agreement as she is still deeply influenced by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was facing a shift from Manchester United to Real Madrid when the event was due to take place, and in the summer he switched to the Italian big club Juventus for 100 million €.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will forever regret" to lose car manufacturers
Britain "will regret it forever" if it lost its world leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Minister of Economic Affairs Greg Clark.
He added that it was "disquieting", that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily reduce production at the plant in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting time at the border in case of a Brexit could without agreement cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, where 90 % of these were exported to the rest of the EU.
"As I see it, production will stop at our factory if Britain goes out of the EU at the end of March," said the Executive Director at Burnaston, Marvin Cooke.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, express fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says that they will close their Mini factory in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is to deal with risks associated with the supply chain in the event of an exit without agreement.
Toyota's production runs on a tight schedule where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems could arise at the border, which, according to the car industry, could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day's production at the Derbyshire plant, and then production would be stopped, said the company.
Clark says that the Theresa May Chequers plan for future negotiations with the EU is "combined so that these checks at the border are avoided."
"We need to have an agreement. We want the best deal that not only allows us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success but to seize this opportunity," he told the BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The statements by Toyota and other manufacturers indicate that we need to be able to continue what has been successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would have stopped, but in the longer term higher prices would reduce the factory's competitiveness, which in the end would cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnston for 24 years and is a co-founder at the factory, says that his members are becoming increasingly concerned: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they will not come again."
One official of the government said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with the Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein can "be postponed another week" as the figure around the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein looks at the special prosecutor Robert Mueller over his shoulder during his investigation of Russian election interference, relations between Trumps helpers and Russia and the president's possible obstacle to the course of the court.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Minister of Justice and thus risk Mueller's independence has been a gossip in Washington for months.
The New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein considered carrying a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deporting the President via the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, and the rumor was that he wanted to quit.
Instead, a meeting on Thursday with Trump was held at the UN headquarters in New York at that time.
Trump said that he would "do not prefer" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate hearing, where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who have accused him of sexual assault, should testify.
Last Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate's election.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked at the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no fixed date. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed a week with all that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we must see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders has not held the White House press meeting since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press meetings was not because of TV reporters' game for the gallery, but added, "I don't disagree that they play up to the camera."
She then said that the direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
"The priest accepts more questions from the press than any president before him," she said and added without citing a source: "We have looked at the numbers."
Press meetings will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We are trying to give it a lot of opportunity, and you have seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it will be in the place of the press meeting when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open hearings or press meetings with high-level guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why when he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the journalists present.
Minister for Health contacts EU staff in Scottish health care after Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom withdraws from the European Union.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to paying for the applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on resignation continue, and it seems that decisions are expected to be taken this autumn.
But the British Government has also increased their preparations for a possible Brexit without an agreement.
I know it must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Collegiates from and outside the EU provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care for the benefit of patients and local communities.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we would like you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie gets acute surgery after main injury
The lineback from Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie was acutely operated after having suffered a head injury on Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, says it from Tennessee's Mike Organ.
First coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the incident took place before the break.
"He went out to the sideline and just fell about out there," said Reed.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before laying him on a stretcher and taking him in for further examination.
A spokesperson from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are no "some details about the type or extent of the damage yet", and Tennessee State tries to find out when he incurred the damage.
Abercrombie studies in the second year and starts his first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five tackles last Saturday before he left the fight, which gives him 18 tackles together this season.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp taxes when buying houses in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp taxes when they purchase a property in the United Kingdom.
This feature must dampen Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The higher tax will be applied to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to provide the homeless with $120 million a year.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp fee when buying properties in Britain for the benefit of the homeless.
The dragon will be considered an attempt to respond to Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper housing and going after them with the highest income.
The increase in the tax will affect people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK. The income from this must be used for the government’s struggle to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The additional fee, which is added to the current stamp fee and the higher levels introduced two years ago at multi-home purchases and rental purchases, can reach 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to collect $120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new constructions in London are bought by people living abroad, making prices rise and making it harder for first-time purchasers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "smooth cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new bill comes only weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in the stamp fee to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices up by buying land that they do not use. He asked May to drop the quotas on cheap dwellings to solve Britain's "boostful housing situation."
Corbyn has proposed a striking number of housing reforms, including the control of rent prices and the depriving of the landlord's ability to put people on the street if they comply with the lease contract.
He will also strengthen the possibility of building public housing.
May said: "For the last year I said that I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life will be better for each generation.
And that means repairing our non-working housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be said that it is just as easy for foreign companies and people living outside Britain to buy homes as for hardworking British.
For too many, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the unworthyness of sleeping on the street is still far too widespread."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become Scotland's coach"
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "ultimate goal" is at some point becoming Scotland's coach.
The 42th round is the challenge of revitalising the North East Club, which now has a third place in League One, three points from the top.
He changed to Stadium of Light this summer after looking for St. Mirren back in the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country playing.
"I played a game with the B team, and that was it," said Ross BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland on Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it has always drawn in me.
However, this option would only occur if I succeeded in training clubs."
Ross' predecessors training for Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says that he had no concerns about following then established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I'm measuring success based on whether I can get this club back in the Premier League.
From the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly hears at home in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I'll only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years into career training after a period of assistance training at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart's training staff.
Then he helped Alloa to come back after being brought down in third-best row and transformed St. Mirren from the dredging threat to the title winners of the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real breakway," he remembers the time in Alloa.
"I honestly thought that the training was the right thing for me, more right than being a player.
It sounds strange because I did it fine, made sense and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There are many things you have to go through on a weekly basis.
There's still the kind of stress and pressure that's training, but it just feels right.
I've always wanted to train, and now I do. I haven't felt more comfortable with myself throughout my adult life."
You can hear the whole interview at Sportsound on Sunday 30 September at Radio Scotland between 12.00 and 13.00 BST.
The best time for a beer is Saturday at 5.30 p.m., showing study
The heat wave this summer has increased the earnings of England's pubs, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
The sale in pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while the sale in restaurants has decreased by 4.8%, showing figures.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA who has collected the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's unexpectedly long World Cup have meant that July follows June's pattern where the pubs experienced more sales of 2.8%, except that the restaurants are harder hit now.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurants in June only got worse in July.
Pubbs and bars with a focus on the sale of beverages did clearly the best and experienced progress similar to the downturn of restaurants.
Pumps with focus on food suffered in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
Looks like people just want something to drink.
The sales of beverages increased by 6.6 % for the month across pub- and trachea, while food fell by 3.3 %."
Paul Newman, who analyses the service industry, said: "The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales on the out-of-home market, the weather and major social or sporting events are the main factors.
It is no surprise that restaurants are still struggling, even though a drop in sales of 4.8% year after year will hurt very badly in addition to rising costs.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only the time will show if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide a hard-needed breathing room."
The total increase in sales overall for pubs and restaurants including new openings was 2.7% in July, showing the decline in newly started fires.

Every five children has a secret account on social media that they hide from their parents
Every fifth child – down to 11 years – has secret accounts on social media, which they hide from their parents and teachers, shows a study.
A study of 20,000 school students in the 4-9th grade reveals growth in "false Insta" pages.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content is being put up
20 % of the students said they have a "main account" that they can show their parents
Every five children down to 11 years create accounts on the social media which they hide for adults.
A study of 20,000 students from grade 4 reveals violent growth in "false Insta" accounts – a reference to the Instagram image-sharing service.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content being put up.
20 % of the students said they have a "main account" that they can show their parents while they also have private.
A mother who fell over her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a teenager who encouraged others to rape me.
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistress' Conference (HMC) for private schools found that 40 % of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to have private accounts.
The leader of the HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "It's scary that so many teenagers are tempted to make online profiles where their parents and teachers can't find them.
Eilith Doyle will be the "vote of athletes" of the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilith Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most winning athlete, and President Ian Bettie described the shift as a good opportunity for those making decisions about sport to benefit from her great 10-year experience at international level.
"Eilidh enjoys a great reputation in the Athletic World in Scotland, the UK and the rest of the world, and we are sure that the Athletics in Scotland will benefit from getting her on the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I will try to be the athletes' voice, and I hope that I can contribute and help out a direction for sport in Scotland."
The American, who won two of its four Olympic gold medals in the 200- and 400-metre races at the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, and who are now often a commentator for the BBC, could not go after a transitoric ischemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote: "A month ago I was struck by a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time would show if I wanted to get on top of it and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm perfectly healthy, I've learned to go back and do today agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for breast pump that compare mothers with cows gets mixed online reception
A breast pump company has shared opinions online with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to cows milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent breast pump", the technological consumer magazine has published a sarcastic music video inspired advertising, to show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a costume full of hay, to a song in which it sounds like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you see no tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, this isn't yövere, it's my breasts."
It says, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my baby, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my bark."
But the advertising, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has led to online controversy.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received a mixed reception from the viewers.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and fed before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth," wrote a user.

Another wrote: "I understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump to mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another one added, "What an insensitive advertisement."
Others defended the advertising, and a woman admitted that she thought the song was "incredible fun."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I were still breast-feeding, I would have had one.
Lactation made me feel just like a cow.
The advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: "It is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who pumps milk (often at their workplace or in toilets) and feels like 'boots'.
It is not an advertisement that praises or criticises the milk industry."
At the end of the video, women reveal that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind advertising is based on the fact that many women who are breast-feeding say that they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely silent, has no pipes or hoses and fits discreetly in a sucker bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their children and even go out while they pumps.
Ana Balarin, who is a partner and director of Mother, wrote: "The pop from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between breast-feeding mothers and dairy cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast-pumping, while in a entertaining and recognizable way we showed the freedom that the new pump can give."
It's not the first time that Elvie's pump created headlines.
In London Fashion Week, a mother went to two catwalks for Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Centuries of migrants secretly moved to tent camps at the Texas border
The number of detained migrants has exploded, although the number of border-goers has not changed, partly because of a harder rhetoric and the tighter laws of the Trump administration that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared their ability to stay in the country by coming forward and receiving a child.
The return risk increased in June when the authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult household members would give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albance, a senior official of the Immigration and Custom Enforcement, witnessed to Congress and told that they had arrested several people who sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested had clean criminal records.
"Assess 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors' households, reside illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are foreign criminals.
So we're still hunting those people," Albence said.
In the attempt to deal with children's cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to come to court within one month of their detention.
Many use video calls instead of themselves to come up and speak their case for legal stay to an immigration judge.
Those who are judged unjust to stay are quickly deported.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to get anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outcomes or attempted escape, it says from relief workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
People who are adopting better conditions say that these risks are more pronounced at larger installations such as Tornillo, where the size makes it harder to keep an eye on whether a child is suffering.
They added that relocation to a town of tentland without mental preparation or the ability to say goodbye to friends can build traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria shall notify the United States, French and Turkish 'crew forces' of their withdrawal without delay.
When Syria's Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moualem, spoke to the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the residence of foreign forces in the country is illegal and under the pretext of combating terrorism, and they will "be met with equivalent means."
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war against terrorism "nearly over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have fled their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this crucial war until we have wiped out all the Syrian areas" for both terrorist groups and "ill-gal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and advise Kurdish and Syrian-Arab forces who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war - torn country.
In the area of refugees, Moualem said that conditions were good enough for them to return home, after which he accused "some Western countries" of "scroll unwarranted fear" that caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They police what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the EU have warned that help will not be provided to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel-controlled city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
Because of the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia was avoided against the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action will follow jihadists from the Nusra Front, a group of sources of Al-Qaeda, which "will be destroyed".
The UN mission, Mr Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee soon to outline a post-war Constitution for Syria and to pave the way for an election.
Moualem has laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee and states that the work of the panel should be limited to "to review the legislation of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
Therefore, Trump wins another Presidential period
From that logic, Trump is probably re-elected by 2020, unless the trial and scandals end his term of office in advance, which many liberal viewers hope for.
In what no doubt will be the most dramatic end of a Presidential period ever!
Currently there is no sign of sighting fatigue.
Since 2014, the ratings in the best transmission time have almost doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best send time compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has most viewers with up to 3.5 million in evenings with great news.
"It's a spectrum that people are attracted to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the ABC-Drame Designed Survivor about a leader of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress Building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy author and author behind "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi in Boston before the elections in 2016.
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,' said Scovell.
The chaos has entertainment value.
However, unlike all other television programmes, the stories coming from Washington can determine the issue between Roe and Wade, whether refugee families can be reunited and the health of the world economy.
Changing the channel is only the most privileged wonder.
And yet it's about more than being enlightened citizen when you see six hours of panel debate, where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background", when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafor's ostrige jacket at $15,000 ("coated with hybris", wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' live descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
At least I'll never see Super Mario the same way.
"Something that makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, managing director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the rotating crew and daily surprises of the Trump show (scarries with N.F.L, praise to Kim Jong-un.)
But if you miss a section, you're off.
When I got to Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was sitting inside and watching MSNBC, while he recorded CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, to be heard in the Senate judicial committee, and the future of the Supreme Court had to be decided.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows before the time, and people said, 'That's the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large sums to find their way to the close mid-term elections to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district receives large sums of money. As a result of a compensation of two "Congressional Districts" two congress members fight for the same seat.
This newly laid suburbs in Pittsburg create problems for the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb stands up against another seated congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which overlaps greatly with the new 17.
The maps were converted, after Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court in January, convicted that the old territory was lawless in the favor of the Republican.
The struggle for the new 17th district has started a struggle for financial resources between the Committees of the Great Parties, the Democrats' Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a choice of high alertness in March' special choice for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seed has been on the Republican hands for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for support to China, but changed its mind
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners threw Trump's management team out.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call leading American diplomats back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognise Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, speaking woman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a notification earlier this month.
But it was only El Salvador who was punished. They received about 140 million dollars of the United States in 2017 for drug control, development and financial support.
The penalties proposed, which include cuts of financial aid and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials held a summit on security and economic development.
In mid-September, however, top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway, thus dropping the thought of punishment to El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has to speak to the conference scheduled for mid-October to signal the importance the Americans attach to the meeting, said diplomats.
And the three American broadcasts secretly went back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new harsh demands or punishments from Washington.
A speaker for Bolton from the White House did not want to comment on the details of the case, which were described by three American officials, including two diplomats who would like to talk about internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the basis of a condition of anonymity.
Known History
The next obstacle could well be the special prosecutor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to investigation, for which there is considerable and publicly available evidence.
To say, Mueller will also direct his investigation against the issue of whether Trump's campaign secretly cooperated with Russia on the attack on the elections.
If Congress were to come to new hands, Trump would probably be held accountable while he is preparing again to meet the voters and eventually a jury of his cousins.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not claim that Trumps is finally inevitable – and so is his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must all make choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
In 1938 German officers were ready to put in with a coup against Hitler if only the West had been able to resist him by supporting the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not grasp the possibility of avoiding the elongated bloodbath after that.
It is about such turning points that the axis of history is turning and the irreversibly march of democracy is decreasing or decreasing.
In the United States, there are now several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who determines the future of Mueller's investigation, Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been warm since this newspaper could announce that he had last year proposed making hidden recordings of the President and challenged his suitability for the office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' production is unprecise.
"How do we react if F.B.I.'s newly sought investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is suspended or not properly carried out – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, more importantly, will we vote at the mid-term elections in favour of a Congress that will hold Trump responsible?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, who was deported to Auschwitz by the self - same Nazi regime, who once occupied the home country of my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath on the table with the cross.
How can I be anything but optimistic about it in the trunk?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic before the fight against SK Rapid Wien
Rangers will take on Thursday against SK Rapid Wien. After the impressive undecided result in Spain against Villarreal earlier in the month they will have good opportunities to move forward from Group G of Europe League with a victory against the Austrians.
A knee injury prevented the midwayer Graham Dorrans from getting the seasonal debut before the 2-2 game against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a springboard for something even bigger.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the fight with the belief that we could bring something home, and we got a point.
Perhaps we could have gone home, but everything in all was probably a reasonable result.
They were probably the best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and we were the best team.
On Thursday will be another great European evening.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they got a good result in the last match. But with the audience behind us, I am sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
The last year has been hard because of everything that has happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can go on now, put the last season behind us and succeed."
Anxiety over pension savings makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the study participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared for, there were few who talked to the family about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study reported that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent told me they were talking to their children about it.
"Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do anything to start the conversation," says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of yourself if you do not tell them about your wishes in good time.
Use your advisor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices can be crucial factors for costs.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find out how to pay for the cost.
For example, long-term care can be financed by a traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payment or self-insurance with your own funds – as long as you have financial resources for it.
Get the legal documents arranged: Take the legal battles in the process.
Get a proxy so you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure that doctors and medical staff comply with your wishes, in case you cannot communicate yourself.
Consider also an economic power.
In that case, you appoint a trusted person who can make financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you do not have the opportunity to do so yourself.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that one of your aged parents needs urgent medical attention and are on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergy?
Get all these details down to font, so you're ready.
"It's not just a question of the economy – who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicine?
Who fits the dog?
Get the plan in place."
Man shot several times with an air break in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a walk in the city.
The victim was in the 40s and found himself in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, the diaphragm and the hand.
Officers describe the shooting that took place around 02:30, as "all by chance."
The victim didn't see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police call on witnesses to stand up.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Since the communication routes are out of play, relief workers have not been able to receive information from the government of Dongulla, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake hit.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesian province and is at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379.800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami hit.
Doggala is a regenerative property that extends over more than 300 km of coastline on the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
In 2017, the government, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299.200.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the Central Sulawesian economy, especially in the Donggala coastal area.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but mainly takes place in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia’s disaster center, Palu and Donggala have been hit several times in the last 100 years by tsunamis.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed several hundred houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was again hit by a tsunami that killed you.
Indonesia is seismologically on the so-called fire in the Pacific and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered on 26 December a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226 000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, including more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in March and only in April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake measuring 6.8 hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, and triggered a tsunami that broke against the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 hit near the town of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake measuring 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai islands from Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya regime in Aceh and spread destruction and panic when the population was reminded of 2004's deadly earthquake and tsunami.
Not a tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapsing buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and Vice President Sarah Palin, have been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska was arrested after suspicion of domestic violence, the prevention of domestic violence reporting, and in order to oppose arrest, according to the report that Saturday was issued by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is the custody in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a guarantee of $500 without security, reports KTUU.
He was put before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "totally not guilty", reporting the network.
Palin is charged for three Class A violations, which can lead to a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of 250,000 dollars.
He has also been charged with a Class B violation, which can lead to a penalty on a single day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with crimes.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is topical during treatment at Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, preventing the reporting of a violent crime at home and possession of weapons in the affected state of the incident.
His boyfriend accused him of giving her a blow in her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after explaining his son's violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his posting in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on Friday hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and communication routes, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit just south of central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On the social media, videos circulate that show the moment when the earthquake hits.
Several hundred people were gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu, when the tsunami broke down on the coast.
Public prosecutors are trying to get terrorist suspects in NYC convicted of the rare death penalty
Public prosecutors are trying to punish the death penalty of Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people – a rare punishment that was last convicted of a crime in the state in 1953.
30-year-old Saipov used in October allegedly a rental car from the construction market Home Depot to perform an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who got in the way were emailed.
As a basis for the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "willfully" killed the eight victims and "willfully" caused serious personal injury.
According to the legal document, the death penalty is a possible result of both of these aims.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury could present Saipov with a case of 22 points, including eight charges for the murder of gangsters, which are typically used by public prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "extensive planning and preparation," said the prosecutors and described Saipov's execution as "unspeakable, vicious and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, physical injury and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Claves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," says the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since New York's southern district last went to court in a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but ended up having a lifetime prison sentence in September 2009.
Most recently the death penalty was imposed on a state case in New York in 1953. Then the couple were executed, after being convicted of espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on 19 June, 1953.
Saipov came from Uzbekistan and, according to legal documents, showed no sign of sign in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was doing well with his actions.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be hung up in his hospital room, told the cops.
He has refused to be guilty of the 22 points of the indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that they were "self-comforted" about the decision of the prosecutors.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and lifelong prison sentence without the possibility of release will only extend the trauma to all those involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had once asked the prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Conservative Minister believes that NIGEL FARAGE should take over the Brexit negotiations
Mr Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a demonstration at the conservative meeting today.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians could "mark the pressure" from the Eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May's own ministers had said that Farage should take over the negotiations with the European Union.
The private Conservative MEP Peter Bone said to the Birmingham demonstration that Britain would have "be out now" if Farage had been a Brxit dealer.
May's challenge in creating unity in the deeply divided party is stressed by the fact that conservative remainers participate in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan track under attack by both British, remainers and the EU.
Her allies insist that despite the setback, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – thereby forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or "kaos".
To the Leo Means Leaves demonstration in Solihull, Bone announced that he was going to scrape the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had the responsibility, we'd be out now," he said.
The minister from Wellingborough added, "I want to fight for Brexit, but we have to scrap Chequers."
On the background of his EU resistance, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be subordinate to anyone.
We will determine our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the fact that the position of the public should have changed since the 2016 vote: "That the British people should have changed their mind and want to stay in the European Union is completely wrong."
The Conservative Brexiters Andrea Jenkys was also at the demonstration and told the journalists: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is unpopular in the wider population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists who are actually on the street and are getting us elected.
Now drop Chequers and start listening.'
As a point of comment to May, she added: "Premier ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the recording that politicians should be able to "mark the pressure", if they fail the vote from the vote in 2016.
"Now it is a question of trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They'll betray Brexit, but we're gathered to tell them that we won't let them get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "You must make sure that the political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, can feel the pressure.
"We are mobilizing the army here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we do not stop until we have become an independent, self-governed and proud Britain."
While marching remainers through Birmingham before a two-hours took place in the city center.
Scattered activists fanned with Conservative Mod Brexit banners after the formation of the group this weekend.
The Labour collegiate Lord Adonis, before the meeting, made fun of the security problems of the Conservatives' party app.
"It is the people who claim to be in control of the IT systems and technology of Canada, of border controls, of free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he said.
"It's all a joke.
There's nothing called a good Brexit," he added.
Warren "considers strongly" to stand up to the presidential elections
Member of the representatives' House Senator Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly to present the presidential elections" following the mid-term election in November.
According to Boston Globe, the Democrat of Massachusetts spoke of his future during an agency meeting on Saturday in the Western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticised Donald Trump, must in November attempt to re-election the state's Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-president of the Trumps Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
One has wondered if she would challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the voters in the town hall, since Trump took over the office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to attend the presidential elections.
Warren replied that it is time that "females go to Washington and repair our political system, and it takes a woman to the front."
Arrested in case of shooting at LSU's Sims
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for shooting at Wayde Sims, the basketball player from LSU.
The police in Baton Rouge announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested on Friday for an ET news meeting at 11.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday to ask for help in identifying a man on the footage.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in his head and died of the injuries," said Sheriff Murphy J. Paul, according to the media, 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to have been present in possession of a weapon and to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and is now in the custody of the East Baton Rouge police.
Sims was a two meter high third-year students who grew up in Baton Rouge. Last season he played 32 matches, started in ten and played on average 17.4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's grand prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the World Championship, after team orders giving him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment that Captain Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a crucial role in the race.
From the leading position, Bottas got a good start and was close to slowing Hamilton off as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove in pit like the first, and let Hamilton fight with the traffic at the back of the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes car went in pit for a while later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back in front of it, when after any wheel contact the Ferrari driver would have to leave the inner court after a third turn double-defence.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was number seven after the first round of his 21st birthday.
Then he led a large part of the race as he in an attempt to change the tires quickly to take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth place.
He had to go to the pit on the 44th round, but could not increase the pace of the last eight rounds, so Raikkonen secured the fourth place.
"It's a difficult day because Valteri made it amazing all weekend and really was a gentleman when he let me come by.
The team did an incredible piece of work to secure us both first and second place," said Hamilton.
Really Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a election meeting last Saturday because she insisted that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford that accused the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a election meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention the testimony that Ford had given in front of the US Senate's judicial committee, but instead said that the events in the Senate showed that people were "wonderful and untruthful and dishonest".
"The one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has happened the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and mean and repulsive and dishonest and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks, and then they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, was that you leaking?
Remember her answer... was it you that leaked the document... "Oh, uh, what?
No, no, no.
I didn't leak anything."
Hey, hold on a second.
If we've leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything," he added in a imitation of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter on Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's accusations, and I haven't leaked her story," said Feinstein to the comet according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I've done so."
But her denial was not well received by the President, who, during the Saturday election, said, "I tell you it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
During the President's further defense of the nominated judge of the Supreme Court, which has been accused of the sexual assault of three women, Trump proposed that the Democrats use the accusations to benefit their own cause.
"They do not secrete any means in their efforts to take back power.
You can see the wickedness, the repulsiveness, they don't care who they're going to hold in order to gain power and control," said the president according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars did it well again after Friday's lost Elite League fight against Belfast Giants by winning the Return 5-3 in Dundee on Saturdays.
Giants quickly came in front with two targets of attack from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie compensated at home before Dwyer brought Giants back to the front.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals more.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's team who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Friday's battle in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides, where Giants went out as victors in the previous three battles.
Dwyer laid out for the fourth minute of 3:35 from an assistant from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as assistant when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
For a busy first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt stood behind Cownie's compensation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants came in front at the first break when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard reunited with a nice goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen lead Dundee ahead for the first time in the fight late in the second period, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four out of their five games, are at home in Milton Keynes for their next fight on Friday.
Air traffic controller died to ensure that hundreds of air passengers avoided earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers was safely brought down to the ground.
More than 800 people are dead and many are missing, after a major earthquake on Friday hit the Sulawesi Island and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful earthquakes still harden the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung’s colleagues fled for life, he refused to leave his seat in the hovering control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed back in his place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who held the runway, got safely in the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was about to collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
Speaking for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, according to Australian ABC News, his decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"We're broke," he added.
The authorities fear that the death rate can reach thousands, and the country's emergency response announces that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death rate is expected to rise, because there are still many bodies in the ruins, and it is not possible to reach them," said the spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six-foot-high waves have destroyed Palu, which holds a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are flying emergency aid and supplies in.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to Sky News: "Every minute a new ambulance with more bodies comes.
There is a lack of clean water.
All the stores are looted."
Jan Gelfand, Head of International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we do not know what we are coming to.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work around the clock to perform all the tasks of the evacuation.
Are you ready?" he said according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombrok earlier this year, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini is now saying that a man is missing after the crash in the lagoon.
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says that a man is missing, even though it had previously been reported that all 47 passengers and crew members were evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini states that the Saturday afternoon could not locate a male passenger.
The airline announced cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned to requests for further information on the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and the crew after the aircraft hit the water during landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline states that six passengers remained in the hospital for Saturday, and that they were all in stable condition.
It is still not clear what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both state that the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very low water.
"It was really lucky," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers could go in water to life to get to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the crew panicked and shouted and that he had a minor head injury.
The American marine said that sailors working to renovate a quay nearby also helped rescue by using a rubber boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank at about 30 metres depth.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG registered airlines over the last two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analytics sets the timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s Office closed its evidence on Saturday in the appeal proceedings for a man charged with burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analysts of the US Ministry of Justice, Paul Rowlett, gave testimony for several hours as an expert witness in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used telecommunications information to compare the course of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he got location data from several different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to his previous claims, says The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time he had claimed that he and his friend Michael Sanford visited Sanford.
Sanford sat down on Saturday and told me he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another disagreement was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' SMS messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He erased her from her life," said Hale.
The defence is planned to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that same day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hiphoptrio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol believes that hiphop has moved away from its origin with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to the starting point and make political hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently received a requisition in Britain because of artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Baby girl in New York sues couples after firing "racistic" text
A nanny in New York sues a couple for discriminatory firing after being sent an SMS message by a mother's fault that complained that she was "still a black person".
The couple denied that they were racists, but compared the case with "enforcement".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who is mother to two, expressed her dismay at finding out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEJ, NOT A SORT PERSON," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, the "outbound" Plasco-Flaxman Giselle Maurice fired and said that their former nanny, who was from African-American, had been bad at her work and that she instead expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day's work and sent home in a Uber.
Now Giselle Maurice is suing the couple to get compensation for the firing and compensation for 350 dollars a day for the six months she should have lived with the family, even though this had been agreed without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't allow yourself to do anything like this," she said to the newspaper Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have defended themselves that they are not racists and that the firing of Maurice was justified because they were afraid they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife had come to send her something she wouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," said Joel Plasco to The Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone whom you had been rude to, even if it had happened by mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the case with "depression" and that his wife had born two months earlier and found herself in a "very difficult situation".
"Do you really go after anyone like that?
It is not very kind," added the investment advisor.
Although the trial is still under way, the People's Court has already depreciated couples on social media and damaged their behaviour and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publisher feared that readers could not relate to a talking bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was admitted to publication, said about the letter: “It’s hard to imagine being the one reading it for the first time before it was published.
It's kind of fun to read now, knowing how popular Paddington was."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a little clothes bar, would have been optimistic, even though his history was rejected, and that the 60th year of the publication of the books was "bitter dead" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father in all modesty was proud of her success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't like to brag," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt as if you had a child who achieved something: you are proud of them, even though it is not really your profit.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he used to say that it was Paddington's fault."
Said goodbye to dying daughter over the phone
After the landing, her daughter was taken to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors in vain tried to save her life.
"Nad called at regular intervals to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn't survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that she would die in the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my darling.
I'll see you soon again.
I'll see you later.
The medicine she had received to keep her heart going, slowly lost their effect.
She was dead shortly before, and now the body shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to really try to get together."
Finally, the grieving Ednan-Laperouse went on board the plane with the other passengers who didn't know what she went through.
"No one knew that," she said.
"I bent my head and the tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Satisfying Women Trying to Stop Suicide Jumpers
Two women who have lost touch on suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have placed cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 years old when he had a depression, and 18 years old when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to experience the grief I experience every day," she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with a infected smile.
"His smile was known by everyone.
People said his smile lit the room up."
But he stopped working before he died because he felt really bad.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him after he took his life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid if it spreads."
Sharon Davis made the maps to "tell people that there is someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don't go with your thoughts yourself – you have to talk to someone."
Sharon Davis' long-standing friend Kelly Humphreys lost his girlfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about him being sad or depressed or anything," she said.
"Some days before Christmas he began to change.
When the kids opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them at all."
She said his death was very traumatic for them, but that they have to get through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
It has torn us apart.
But we all have to continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still unclear, while the FBI starts investigating
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for – a limited time-limited study – we could perhaps get a little consensus," said Flake on Saturday and added that he feared that the comet "departed" in the middle of the locked party situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican support not have the FBI do their investigation?
Their restraint is due to timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if the Republicans, as expected, manage badly, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they would like to choose as the highest judge in the country.
George W. Bush called Senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush, and then met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has completed its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate in which there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the decisive vote and choose him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean Jumpers 'falls' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean Jumpers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from South Korea's Ministry of Association and said that there were 1.127 shoppers last year compared to 2.706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher figures due to human smugglers were contributing to the changed figures.
Pyongyang has not given any official comments.
In time, most of North Korea’s apostates are offered citizenship in South Korea.
The Government of South Korea states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border adjacent to North Korea, and which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China sees it as illegal immigrants and not refugees, so that they are often forced to go home.
The relationship between North and South Korea – which is technically still at war – has significantly improved over the last few months.
Earlier this month the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met to talk about the stranded negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This takes place after the historic meeting in June between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work against an atomic-free Korea at an overall level.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no belief in our national security, and in such circumstances it is ruled out that we will disarm on our own," said Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric" and says that he is unfit for the Supreme Court
Chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated as Supreme Court judge, for "hysteric" and said that his temperament was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosis comment came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like that, they would have called her hysterical," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee last Thursday.
Kavanaugh rejected the allegations that he had committed a sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he spoke of his family and his years in high school, he almost shouted and was crying.
He also condemned the Democrats in committee and called the accusations against him "groteske and a coordinated characterism" organized by the left who was angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the post of Presidents in 2016.
Mr Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not sit in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was preoccupied with the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with the statements and the way he went after Clinton's and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi road beyond when she was asked whether she would try to bring Kavanaugh for a Kingdom court if he was confirmed and if the Democrats were given a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'd like to say that if he doesn't speak truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, but certainly to the court in which he's sitting now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Court of Appeal.
Mr Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions in relation to Obama's health reform or the Roe v. Wade abortion case because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings Kavanaugh did not answer questions as to whether he would reverse certain previous Supreme Court rulings.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, preconceived person must contest a job as a judge and expect us to say 'yes, it is not just great'," said Pelosi.
And women have to use it.
It is a righteous outcome, several months of anger and years, that she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal.
She continued: "I got a great support from a woman who was the boss who said that she also cried when she got angry, but that she developed a technique which meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to: "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are thoroughly misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with an overweight of men, where I often cried out of anger, where I was taken by the neck of an older woman – a cold boss, whom I had always been a little afraid of – and pulled out on the stairs.
"You must never let them see that you're crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They'll think you're sorry, and they'll accept that they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, who at that time was a member of the Congress of the Democrats from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was exposed to having an affair on a boat named Monkey Business and withdrew as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and came to the conclusion that she as well could set up as a presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a very well thought-out decision," she said laughing at me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates and they certainly did not need another candidate.
Some called it the Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was behind with fundraising, so she promised she wouldn't participate unless she collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she gave a speech that she would not set up, she was overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to raise money and reach voters instead of voters, and anger over sexism – that she got a lump in her throat.
"You could think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls how the press responded to her.
"You'd think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my gravestone?
"She cried"?
This is how the trade war between the United States and China can be an advantage for Beijing.
The opening hymns of the trade war between the United States and China were loud, and although the battle is far from over, the gap between countries can be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, says experts.
The American President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing duties on important Chinese export products, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest escalation this week with new customs duties affecting goods for a value of USD 200 billion applies, in principle, to half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has made a return every time, most recently by imposing customs duties of 5-10 % on US goods for $60 billion.
China has sworn to follow the United States all the way, and the world's second largest economy probably does not provide after just a while.
If it makes Washington withdraw its demands, it means that they give in, but for China's President, Xi Jinping, it would be too embarrassing to bow to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the US pressure in the trade war can have a positive effect on China over the long term by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
"A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can create a breeding ground for an economy that can come out of control in both countries, and it is actually much more dangerous than one thought," said Abigail Grace, research worker focusing on Asia at the thought of the Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' to receive refugees, says Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that it is ready for the refugees to return and to ask for help to build up the country destroyed by the more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to control the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore a normal state.
All the circumstances are now in place for refugees to return to the country they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that hit their daily lives and living.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since 2011, where the war began.
Another six million people still in the country need emergency aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian Government would like to accept help in rebuilding the land that is in decline.
But he stressed that the government would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that helped to support the rebellion.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup 2018 and struck the American team 16,5 - 10,5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won one Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy back when Captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points that it required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mikkelson, who had a hard time in most of the tournament, shot his drift in the lake at par 3 on the 16th hole, causing him to lose the game against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari did well in all rounds and became 1 out of a total of 4 players who have got 5-0 since 1979, where the tournament's current format started.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 of the lowest ranked European player, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
No. 1 on the World Order List, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Veteran with eight Ryder Cups in Baggage, Spain Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's most winning European with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't do for it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm really happy to get the trophy back.
It is a team effort, and I am glad that I could help," said a feeling-charged Garcia after the European victory.
He's sending the flare to his countryman John Ram, who fell down the American golfing Tiger Woods 2/1 on a single game Sunday.
"I am so proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It's a bunch of statistics for one of the best golfers ever who has won 14 great titles, only exceeded by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had all weekend problems finding the form with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, said after his team's disappointing display: "I'm proud of the boys, for they fought for the cause.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe counterplay.
We lost.
Hat off for Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All of his 12 players played really well.
We want to regroup, and I want to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we move on.
I love the 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
