Politicians in Wales are afraid of "big fools"
There was a horror among certain members of the Walisian National Assembly over a proposal that their title should be changed to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It has been created because of plans to change the name of the Assembly to Welsh Parliament (the Welsh Parliament).
AMs from all over the political spectrum are concerned that the name change could give rise to ridicule.
A member of the Labour party said his group was worried because "it rhymes on Twp and Pwp."
To readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool, and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said that the group as a whole "was not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group was "open" to the change of names, but noted that there is only a short verbal spring from MWP to Muppet (fjols).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way, as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently putting together a bill on the introduction of the names changes, said: "The final decision on the nominations that Members of Parliament will receive is of course up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals in which there was broad support for calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
With regard to the title of the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members (walisian MPs) or WMPs, but the MWP option received the greatest support in a public consultation.
AMCs suggest seemingly alternative options, but the struggle to reach agreement may prove difficult for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to put together a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The bill on reforms contains other changes in the way in which the Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the composition of the Committee system.
The AMs are given the final vote on what to be called when the bill is debated.
Macedonians vote for a change in the country's name
The voters vote on Sunday whether their country's name should be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote will be held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor’s name constitute a requirement for Greece’s territory and has long protested against Macedonia’s attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov is opposed to the vote and says he will underscore the vote.
The supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is just a price paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's will be quiet, while the churches of Harlem fight
"The older people I've talked to said that there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
“Today there are none of the parts.”
He said it is understandable that the bars disappear.
"People socialize in other ways today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood's daily lounges, where people enter on a daily basis."
In relation to churches, he worries that the money obtained from selling assets does not last long, and that they “before or later are back where they started.”
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes that are full of the kind of people who do not help the neighborhood's return free places.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he says, "and it breathes further to the development, where these churches eventually close completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original methodistness moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had worked nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who stood in the spear for a boycott of shops at 125th Street, one of the primary shopping streets in Harlem, which would not employ or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 damaged the building heavily, but when Father Johnson's parish children made plans to restore the building, they ordered the clock game.
The priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martin's, called the proud clock game "the watch of the poor."
The expert who played on the clock game in June called it something else: "A cultural myth" and "a irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first clock game in the world that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger clock game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't find a replacement for him.
What has been played in St. Martin’s over the past few months has been a complicated narrative of architects and entrepenters. Some of them obtained by church leaders, others of the diocese.
The Council of the Congregation — the leading instance of the parish, which consists of leading laymen — wrote in July to the diocese of concerns that the diocese “would try to push the spending further” to the congregation council, although the congregation council had not been involved in employing the architects and entrepiners who the bishop sent in.
Some of the congregation members complained of lack of transparency from the side of the bishop.
Haj damage 13-year-old on diving trails after lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded Saturday a 13-year-old boy when he died after lobsters in California on the first day of the summer season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then along with a group of paddled over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just enthusiasm to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy cried, "I was bogged down!
I was bogged down!”
“He was torn up,” said Hammel, when he arrived at the boy.
“I cried that everyone should get out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was reported in critical condition.
It is unclear what kind of shark there was attacks.
Larry Giles said in a media briefing that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the stretch from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons and for conducting investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to take the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's takes the competition up with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with a range of beauty products with special assistants in style with large magazines.
As part of a great effort to occupy the UK’s beauty market, which has a value of 2.8 billion GBP and continues to grow, while fashion and housing products valley. The larger rows of beauty products are tested in 11 shops around the country and launched in several stores next year if they prove to be a success.
The investment in beauty products takes place as supermarkets are looking for new goods for shelves that were previously used for television, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's says they double their range of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw introduced for the first time.
The existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with branded areas in style with those you see in shops like Boots.
Supermarket also relaunches the range of Boutique makeup, so the majority of products are suitable for vegans - something that is increasingly required by younger shoppers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop tests the estate in two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened in Croydon in the southern part of London last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a development towards purchasing small quantities of food daily with local merchants means supermarkets need to do more to make people visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury's, has said that the shops will look like big magazines, as the supermarket chain takes the fight up with Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales sites in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales sites since they bought both chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their sales of groceries and have made the purchases more profitable.
Supermarket’s previous attempts to update beauty and pharmacy departments were wrong.
Sainsbury's tested a joint action with Boots in the early 00s, but the collaboration ended with a quarrel about how the earnings from pharmacies in the supermarkets would be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy chain with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, 125 GBP three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the appearance and decor of our range of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to advise.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs and the consuming environment and practical placements mean that we are now a compelling destination that challenges the old way to shop.”
Peter Jones "fast," after Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to 11 million GBP
Dragons' The star Peter Jones left "serious," after TV host Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to 11 million GBP with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time for their home product and accessories-brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop brand.
This Morning weather, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she leaves the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' The star Peter Jones furiously after she pulls away from their lucrative lifestyle fire at the last moment - to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "fast" when the popular TVwoman during an intense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, said that her new agreements, with a value of up to 1.5 million GBP, meant that she had no longer enough time for their housing product and accessories-brand Truly.
The company had been compared with Gwyneth Paltrows Goop brand and was capped to double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of 11 million GBP.
Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she left Truly while Jones flew out of Britain to one of her holiday homes.
A source said, "Truely was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would have been a long-term project that she had to deal with for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday. It was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods in the headquarters of Marlow, which is already ready for sale.”
Experts consider that the announcement from this Morning presence, which is among the UK’s stars with the highest earnings, can cost the company millions due to large investments in products — ranging from pillows to candlesticks for clothing and housing products — and the potential for further delays of the launch.
It can also be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby and his housebond Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly along with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, as Chairman of the Board in March.
The two couples take on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be a fire ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin who has hosted ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business."
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love."
He made laugh with the criticism he would get from the news media to give a comment, which "not a president worthy" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his parody at a news conference.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in a meeting more, after Trump declared their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have gone on.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "similar reaction" from the United States in relation to North Korea's initial action of disarmament.
He noted that the United States will continue sanctions aimed at keeping pressure running.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view in the speech at his election meeting.
"It's going well with North Korea," he said.
“There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his attempt to improve Kim's relationship had created positive results - the end of rocket tests, the release of hostages and the return of earthly remains from U.S. military officials.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
"It's so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to enter this densely packed arena, we would have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the group just ahead of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake armies island and kill hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, non-governmental organizations, for example, were told that there was no need for them.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombox population stood without home, national disaster states were not declared, which is a prerequisite for calling for international relief.
“In many cases, it has been clear that they do not request international assistance, so it’s a bit challenging,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children assembles a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson for the national disaster preparedness, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to emergency relief efforts.
Due to the earthquakes, Indonesia is constantly exposed to, the country is very poorly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami resorts are built in Aceh, but they are not a common view on other coastlines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but there is apparently a tsunami, and it has probably affected the death toll.
Even under the best conditions, it is challenging to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been lying in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Joko Widododo made Indonesia’s inadequate infrastructure a central point in his campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and train routes.
But Mr Joko’s administration has been plagued by lack of funding as the election campaign next year.
Mr Joko is also experiencing pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes, as Christians and Muslim bands fought on the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.

Parliament's statue of Cromwell will be the latest memorial framed by discussion on "rewriting history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical, Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "falty" and a "try to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in connection with the current debate on the removal of statues, that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace at Westminster would be a goal.
The storm during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is sacrificed for his grandfather Thomas’ actions in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s amazing depiction of Cromwell is a testimony of attitudes in the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe it is worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against out-of-court pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate representation is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is certainly certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure representing one side of the struggle.
His performance as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering.”
Killing pig assaults and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man identified only under his last name, "Yuan", was found dead with an overreached arteries and embedded in blood near a pig paste on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to give pigs injections with vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had reportedly travelled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The following morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pig horse next door was open.
He said that there was a great snake with blood in his mouth.
A forensic study confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had bited the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and breastfed," said the cousin, who goes under the last name "Wu", in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Records from security cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The beast who killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A leader of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while police collect evidence at the crime scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and authorities from the market negotiate compensation for his death.
It belongs to the soul units, but there are previously recorded cases where pigs have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig hit 295 kg a Welsh farmer against his tractor, into his wife scare the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a man from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger."
"They're just a doctor.
They're very curious, they're not going to hurt you.
“You just have to treat them with respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to provide heavy rain in large parts of the southwest United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it moves across the cooler waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will provide heavy rain with floods in northern Mexico and southwest the United States over the coming days.
Rosa had won 38 m/s, a category 1 hurricane, at 10 Sundays (Danish time) and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, it is becoming a low-pressure race across the Pacific Ocean that moves to the east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California Monday as a tropical storm, it begins pushing tropical moisture to the north into the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture interacts with the low pressure drains that come closer, creating heavy rain in the southwest United States in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storm floods, floating falls, and possibly landslides in the desert.
The tropical moisture will create rain with up to 51 to 76 mm of rain per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to reach 51 to 101 mm of rain in parts of the southwestern United States, especially over much of Arizona.
There is a high likelihood of storm floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to tropical rains scattered nature.
It would be a very bad idea to move out into the desert on foot when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can transform gaps into booming rivers and thunder will create powerful local winds and create dust blowing.</seg>
The low-pressure drain approaching will provide heavy rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of total rainfall of over 13 mm, which can give less amounts of liquid precipitation and smooth roads.
This would be the region's first rainfall in their rainy season.
Scattered tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the area Four Corners Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October, there may be large temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as the Arctic is becoming cooler, but it remains reasonably warm in the tropics.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences through the central U.S. Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeastern areas.</seg>
There can be up to 26 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates that there is a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million saw the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million on Thursday’s touching testimony from the nominee to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle with stations interrupted the regular programs to tell about Friday’s late development: an agreement composed by Senator from Arizona Jeff Flake, who allowed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she is 100 percent sure Kavanaugh in the drunk state was gagged at her and tried to take her clothes off to a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a emotional testimony that he is 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
According to Nielsen, 20.4 million people saw it on Friday.
The company listed average viewer numbers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediately available serial numbers from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems measuring how many people see programs in offices.
To put it in perspective, there is a number corresponding to a match under the NFL playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-borne hosts have greatly grounded up the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing that lasted all day, said Nielsen.
ABC was second-placed at 3,26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2,94 million, MSNBC had 2,89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught for open CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, while protesters shouted at him when he tried to take an elevator to the hearing in the judicial committee.
He stood with down-facing eyes for several minutes while he was kicked out, and CNN sent live.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said a woman.
“Do you think he says the truth to the country?”
He got to know, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and said before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at the hearing of the committee.
All television stations covered live a few hours later, when the judicial committee would vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination would go on to vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said that he would vote only for under the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee in the following week, which the Democrats in the Senate had sought.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of Senators, Flake took his decision.
Flake's elections had an impact because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the study.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
Britain's Prime Minister accuses critics of "legal policies" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU to "legiate politics" with Britain's future and undermine national interests. It happened in an interview with the newspaper Sunday Times.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservatives' Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside Theresa May on the paper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson put an attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal for the UK and the EU to collect each other's tariffs was "helt through ridiculous."
Suddenb on Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson who is suspected of standing behind LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspected gunshot attack on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of negligent mandrab, police said in Baton Rouge.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the game.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on, reported CBS daughter company WAFB.
After the interrogation of Simpson, the police said he had committed a shooting attack on Wayde.
His bail is set to $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The law medicine in East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death was a wound from a gun shot that went from the head to the neck.
The police department says a Russian force from Louisiana State Police, the state police laboratory, police from Southern University and citizens in the area has assisted the investigation leading to the arrest.
The sports leader at LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police in the area for their "about and hunted for justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach at LSU, Will Wade, said the team is "closed" and "in shock" over Waydes' death.
“That’s the kind of thing you’re always afraid of,” Wade said.
Volcanoes ash over Mexico City
Ash, which is sprung from the volcano Popocatepetl, has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Saturday Mexicans to be away from the volcano, after which activity occurred in the crater, and 183 samples of gas and ash were recorded during 24 hours.
The Center monitored the space and shaking over several laps.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car trucks in neighborhoods in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have noted increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the richter scale, shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police encounter with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protesters who want independence, along with unrest enforcement officers, as many thousands participated in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote on release.
A group of masked separatists kept alarm officers back, thrown with and powder paint and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There were also fights later in the day when police used their spells to keep fighting down.
For several hours independence groups shouted "Nothing forgotten, nothing forgiven," and were met with unionist protesters who shouted "Long live Spain".
14 people received treatment for minor injuries that occurred during the protests, the local press reported.
The vote remains high in the independent-minded region one year after the vote on 1 October, which was declared illegal from Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters voted in overwhelming degree for independence, but the voter turnout was low, and those opposed to the release, boycotted in great style the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote during violent clashes at ballot sites throughout the region.
Independence groups had camped the night until Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held but was forced to take another route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer dared to hope that Catalonia can achieve independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents crying for pleasure to have the opportunity to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Although they got a narrow but important victory in regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum, and many of their best known leaders are either moved in exile or are sitting in detention and awaiting judgment for their role in the holding of the vote and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, took the protests on his phone as a supporter of the police and said the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"There will be bigger and bigger tensions," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has awaited his trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“The position as a candidate in the European elections is the best approach to distance the backlash of democratic values and the subjugation we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house hit by car
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car several times entered a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 7:30 p.m. BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
There may also be an armbow against the car at some point.
Skud from Menga gives Livingston a win of 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Mengas's first goal for Livingston secured victory
The openings of Livingston exceeded Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his only second defeat after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Mengas shot the difference when Gary Holt's team moved side by side with Hibernian at second place.
Gerrard's team hasn't won in the league in this season and will meet the leading team Hearts, which they are eight points after, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will visit Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, in turn, expands their undefeated strip to six games, and Chief Coach Holt has still not won a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses chances of cash out.
Holt's team would have been in front of a long time before they scored, and their direct playing style created major problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but handed across in front of the goal, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the target after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's two-way header in front of the goal.
The home team was pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could give out undisturbed problems in dead-bold situations.
And it was during the conditions that the important goal came.
Rangers made a free kick, and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created the plot to Menga, which made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
At that time, the Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but struggled to get through the home team's defenses, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely not challenged.
The pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos left a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shots were deposed with the feet of Rangers painter Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame under another of Livingston's deathball situations.
There were ongoing shipments into Livingston's field, but were deposed, and two demands for penalty kicks - after Halkett's tackle on the replacement Glenn Middleton and one hand on the ball - were rejected.
"Fenenomental" from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Moral efforts and strong results for Livingston.
Everyone played amazingly and exceeds the expectations of their upward journey.
Their playing style and team are largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but a large part of the honor must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he entered.
There were many heroes.
An anchor Halkett was fantastic and led a well-organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worall on the carpets throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
They have at times been really good at Gerrard, but they played below level.
Their endings lacked sharpness - only once they got the bare homehold - and it's a steep awakening for Rangers, located in the middle of the pointboard.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Køllen
There was smile and blue sky Saturday (29 September), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
There has been disagreement over areas such as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's approximations to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Køllen to open a new, large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police held a crowd of 25,000 from collecting in front of the mosque, but lots of supporters appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan rebels - many of them Kurdish - also noticed and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to accept the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as a hero of some German Turks and mocked as an autocratic of others.
Unearthed on the road in Deptford: Cyclist dies in clashes with car
A cyclist is dead in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred close to the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwest part of the city around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and there were savers on the spot, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurs a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car whose driver fled the site, on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said police officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road anchors have been installed, bus routes have been rescheduled, and motorists are encouraged to stay from the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured during unrest
Six prison officers are injured during high-security arrests according to Prison Office.
Concerns arose in the prison of HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9.30 BST Sunday, and the unrest are still underway.
Specialized "Torrnado" officers have been brought in to deal with the riots involving eight inmates and take place in one wing of the prison.
The girls were treated for minor facial injuries on the site.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: “Seriously trained prison inmates are set to deal with the ongoing unrest in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and are clear that the responsible are being reported to the police and may end up spending longer behind them.”
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison inspector was treated in the hospital after being attacked by an insulate.
And in October last year, emergency officers were called to prison to deal with serious unrest, where employees were attacked with carlar bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm flood (dry areas can take advantage)
It is rare that a tropical low pressure strikes Arizona, but it is most likely at the beginning of next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert landscape in the southwest United States and create a risk of storm flood.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of storm floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only "ti tropical cyclones had preserved status as tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km from the border to Arizona.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center anticipate 51 to 102 mm of rain with isolated amounts up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, will likely get 25 to 51 mm with the possibility of 102 mm locally.
For those outside the risk of storm flood, Rosa's rain can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will make use of because the southwestern United States is currently experiencing drought.</seg>
According to the U.S. drought monitoring, over 40 percent of Arizona suffers at least extreme drought, the second highest category,” reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is expected to hit land on the peninsula of Baja California, Mexico.</seg>
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning with maximum winds of 38 m/s and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves north by 19 km/h.
The storm meets cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore valleys in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with tropical power on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over parts of Mexico can become severe and pose a high risk of flooding.
"There is expected to be a total of 76 to 152 mm from Baja California to the northwestern Sonora with the possibility of up to 254 mm," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the border of Arizona early in the morning Tuesday as tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The primary expected danger from Rosa or the remains of it is very heavy rain in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora and the Southwestern desert area of the United States," the National Hurricane Center reported.
The rain is expected to create life-threatening storm floods and floating falls in deserts as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attacks in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man are arrested under suspicion of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found with a stick wound in Somerset.
The Teenage Boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton at about 4 BST on Saturday.
He was brought to the hospital where his condition was reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, police said in Avon and Somerset.
The participants have called on everyone who had to have mobile recordings of the events to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh was under the influence of the Democratic Party.
"A vote on Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the democratic party's ruthless and irrevocable tactics," Trump said at a Wheeling election in West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has been exposed to “the violence, anger” from the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave testimony before Congress on Thursday and denied strong and emotional accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that he was sexually assaulting her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave testimony at the hearing of his charges.
The president said Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and fashion" of Kavanaugh that day.
“A voice on confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice confirming one of the most skilled legal brains of our time, a lawyer with a fantastic past in public service,” he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh, while he spoke of the importance of Republicans meeting at the ballots at the mid-term elections.
“About five weeks is one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
You can't vote for me, but you actually vote for me," he said.
“That’s why I travel around and fight for amazing candidates.”
Trump argued that Democrats are out on a mission to “stress against and block.”
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday, a person has been highly placed in the Republican Party told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, the death toll grows
At least 384 were killed, and many of them were washed away by huge waves that hit the beach, when a large earthquake and a large tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Saturday.
Several hundred people were gathered to a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters of high waves hit the coast at dawn, sucked many in death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami arose after an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the richer scale.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still busy activities on the beach. They didn't run immediately and were sacrificed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster preparedness GDPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, the bullied cars, tree trunks, houses, the hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea with 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
More people managed to survive by climbing trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
Around 16700 were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The Disaster Preparation has published aerial photographs showing many broken buildings and shops, distorted and interconnected bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Afternoon continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The spread of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Board of Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy triggered during Friday’s major earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb thrown over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and it may have made the tsunami larger.
Nugroho described the damage as "excellent" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were run together.
The bodies of a number of victims were found stuck under the murals from assembled buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been injured, and that 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho said that the death toll and damage could be larger along the 300 km long coastline north of Palu, the area of Donggala that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication "was completely paralyzed without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300,000 people here," Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their employees and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” they said.
The Board of Directors was criticised on Saturday by many fronts not to state that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said the waves had come within the time of the warning.
In amateur recordings shared on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building who desperately shouts warnings about the tsuami that comes closer to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The Earthquake and tsunami caused a great flow of power that defuses communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun to send freight aircraft with emergency assistance from Jakarta and other cities, reports authorities, but there is still a hard need for food and basic necessities among the evacuated.
The city’s airport has been reopened, but only for relief work, and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death of Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have come safely to Palu city, where employees seek shelter under the pressures set up in the courtyard by their account. They came past areas of extensive destruction on the road, Doseba said.
"They told me that they had so many broken houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when aid organizations began the harsh work of putting aid back on, complaints came about that foreign emergency workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, financial support, supplies and staff from abroad must only come in if the area where the accident has happened is declared national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at provincial level," said Alia Arriani, a spokesperson for Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘OK, it’s a national disaster’, we can open for international assistance, but there’s no status yet.”
On the second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing people kept in the hope that their closest would be the miracles that illuminate the gloomy tales of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under murals for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paraglids to Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those caught at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were among his students.
“As the veteran of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon told me how he spent the hours, after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles, desperately had sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who were in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, only resulted in one grey flyben instead of two blues.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Tyve takes $2,750 USD during the filling up of ATMs in Newport on the Levee
Tyve stole Friday morning 26.750 USD from a Brink’s employee, who was fulfilling a Newport ATM on the Levee, according to a Newport press release.
The car driver had emptied the slot machine in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran "open behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag money that would have been delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
All with information about theft's identity please contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
He announced the change Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: "The former known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change takes place ahead of his performance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, who cancelled "feeling reasons," the show's creator said.
The name is an abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance to him.
"I think that 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing his album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only thing, to just Ye, which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused pages, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has changed between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West’s former partners, JAY-Z, has also shifted between small and large letters and changed whether the hyphen is included.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use military power against civilians
Mexico’s newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has never promised to use military power against civilians, as the country is approaching the 50th year of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "never would ever use the military to suppress the Mexican people."
Troops shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 at a time when left-wing student movements broke many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly state grants to students and opening more free open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities draw young people into criminal ties.
The United States should double the funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in the field, says investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have provided announcements of artificial intelligence. However, the United States still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, however, introduced their plan last year and aims to take the first place in innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030.
“It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind compared to the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
doubling the budget could double the chances that the next major performance in artificial intelligence is achieved in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent companies in artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that hit the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later became head of Microsoft Research and Director of Google's department in China.
Lee recognized former technology competitions supported by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge, held by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition will take place so that the next visionary can be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain trusts from the government,” Lee said.
“It’s not China that stumbles the academic leaders, it’s the big companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies in recent years employ star students from universities to working with artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen efforts in artificial intelligence.
“I think that PhDs in artificial intelligence should automatically have offered work permits.
China’s State Council issued their Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation delivers funding to people in academic institutions in a way similar to the National Science Foundation and other state organizations’ distribution of money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a common center for artificial intelligence, which will involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the foundation of Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative named AI Next.
NSF currently invests over 100 million USD a year in research in artificial intelligence.
However, American legislation trying to create a national security commission for artificial intelligence has stood still for several months.
Macedonians vote for a change in the country's name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday to determine whether their country's name should be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia", an action that would solve a decades old dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's attempts to gain membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and maintains that the name of their neighbouring country to the north constitutes a requirement for Greek territory, and has therefore used their veto when Macedonia has sought admission in NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's primarily Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not participate in the vote, and a boycott campaign has created doubts as to whether the vote will constitute the 50% required for the vote to be valid.
The question of the vote reads, "Are you for NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price that is worth paying to create access to associations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU umbrella because it means more secure life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will comply with the voting result and do so.
The name change would require a majority in parliament in two-thirds.
The government's election commission said that at 13 o'clock there were no reports of irregularities.
However, the election vote was only 16 percent compared to 34 per cent in the last 2016 parliamentary election, with 66 per cent of the registered voters voting.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a president of the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko participated in the vote in Macedonia on a change of the country's name, which would open up membership of NATO and the EU, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Before the Parliament of Skopje prepared Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, a small scene and pulled chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the vote.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we will gain membership with raised foreheads, not by the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would provide a highly needed investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
“I believe that a large majority will vote for because more than 80 percent of our citizens enter the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after giving their vote.
He said that a "yes" result would be a "proofing of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonia Institute of Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the vote - fewer than the required election.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the vote must be at least 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the Provincial Government since it entered in May last year.
Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero fights through the Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his scoring that came after 65 minutes.
Argentinian attackers received a delivery on the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly ran past three Brighton defenders, before going out on an open track.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green trees.
He fought over one defender and subsequently ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a shipment to the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to list Brighton painter Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
“Aguero struggles with some issues with his feet,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about playing about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the immediate advance of the Premier League game.
That goal came after 29 minutes.
Aguero received in the sequence ball deep inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a great delivery along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of touchs before he led Sterling to the farest post.
The Sky Blues forward dotted the ball in the net, just before it slipped past the goal.
City fights against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12:55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to drille Rockies
Nationals are eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn’t have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to take the pitch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still opportunities for participation in Rockies playoffs, which have played a game more than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies held at least stuck in a wild-card square with a 5-2 win over National's Friday night, but still have their first division stamps for good.
"Although we have nothing to play for, we can go to the fight well knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audience here in Denver, and that the opponents would play at the enough highest level I'm going to face this year.
Why shouldn’t I be excited to play under those conditions?”
Nationals have not yet released the start-up for Sunday, but will probably put Scherzer in as pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the record for 34th time, trained his throw Tuesday and would pitch on Sunday, which is normally his resting day.
The right hand player from Washington is 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings in this season.
Trump holds election meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance that Republicans face up at the ballots at the mid-term elections.
“All we have done is play in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
It’s one of the big, big, you can’t vote for me, but you actually vote on me. That’s why I travel around and fight for amazing candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you can see, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to get power back with all available means. You can see how evil they are.
They don’t care who they damage who they are going to drive over to gain power and control. That’s what they want, power and control, but we won’t give them it.”
The Democrats, he said, have as a mission "strengthening against and blocking."
"And you've seen it over the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats "right and evil and disgusting and false."
He referred to the Supreme Democratic Senator of the Senate Judicial Committee Dianne Feinstein by name, triggering loud arch from the public.
"Can you remember her answer?
Did you know the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, no, wait, it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a spacious party.
They are tolerant of those who express their attitudes.
When Momentum’s activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn’t really a surprise.
I am just the latest in a number of MPs from Labour who have learned that we are not welcome — alone because we have given our opinion to know.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she took a strong distance from anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship went out to criticize me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of a responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically enough similar problems, such as Jeremy disagreed with former leaders.
At the meeting of Nottingham East Labour on Friday, it stated that “we want meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For the majority of my eight years as a local Member of Parliament, the meetings on Friday have just been like this.
Today, the tone of many meetings is unfortunately not such, and the law on "friends, blinds" policy is far back in the past, if it ever started.
It has become more and more clear that divergent views are not tolerated in Labour, and that all opinions are weighed by whether the party's leadership can accept them.
It started shortly after, Jeremy became leader when colleagues, as I previously thought, I shared political stances with, began to expect that I would make a U-turn and take positions that I would otherwise have never agreed, regardless of whether it was about national security or the EU's internal market.
When I say my opinion in the public — and that’s really just as much as I say — I follow a long striped rough message on the social media that calls for rejection and contradiction of the middle-running policy and tells me that I shouldn’t be a member of Labour.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed against me are usually political.
I have deep respect for professionalism and the struggle will of the colleagues, who, every day, are overcome with sexism or racism, but still fights on.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is where normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour would create a tolerant culture.
But in reality, there is no longer a spacious organization and with each mistrust vote or change selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
I’ve been given lots of advice over the past two years that if I lay on myself and aren’t so loud, I’m going to be “no good.”
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I became a member of Labour 32 years ago, when I went to school, I was provoked by Thatcher government neglect that had left our classroom in a falling state, and I set myself to create better public services for those who need it most, whether it has been as a council member or minister in the government.
I have never hidden my policy, nor in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused in any way about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the motion for a resolution on Friday, I would say that when the country is stepping forward to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour’s leader.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr will be top team
Two late scores may have had the final result of drawing a not completely sandy picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this fantastic entertaining match of the day in Tent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard and are the only undefeated team of ten.
In the end, it was just as much their superior defense as their better exploitation of chance that carried home home, and coach Peter Murchie had absolutely the right to be satisfied.
"Our struggles have been demanding so far, and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Respect to Ayr, they took advantage of their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's scoring after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr in front, but a yellow card to Scottish national team player Rory Hughes, who was awarded to the fight by Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a scoring which was not followed by a kick.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a penalty kick just before the semi-legend. He scored and then got a solo score, so there were 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose began well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's scoring, followed by a kick from Baggot, reduced the point difference to five.
Then there was a long interruption, because Ruaridh Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was worn out of the field on a stretcher. When the game was resumed, Ayr expanded the course with a score from Stafford McDowall and a follow-up kick from Climo.
Acting Ayr anchor Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card, and again took advantage of Melrose's extra man with a score from Bruce Colvine without a follow-up kick after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came again, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson could score after a line-out score behind the forward Ayr cluster.
Climo followed up with a kick in the poles and followed up with a more nearly straight after, the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe opened David Armstrong's box kick and sent winger Gregor Henry to the home track's fifth scoring.
Still Game star looking for new careers in the Restoration Industry
Still the Game star Ford Kieran seems to take the step to the restaurant industry, after it emerged that he has taken the director post for an authorized restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main character in collaboration with his partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last season of the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Avangmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but a source suggested Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"Havet is ours": India's state of Bolivia hopes that court will reopen route to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors patrol around the headquarters of the fleet, which enclosed in rains, in La Paz.
In public buildings there is a sea blue flag.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are overlaid with the motto: "The ocean is ours, it is a right.
It’s a duty to take it back.”
In the entire Indian state of Bolivia, the memory of a coastline that was lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century remains strong, and the same is the longing to sail on the Pacific Ocean again.
The hopes may be at their highest for decades, while Bolivia awaits a verdict from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of voting.
"Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and naturally awaits a positive look at the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivarians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country and hope that the Court of Justice of The Hague will allow Bolivia to agree that Chile, after several decades of debate, is committed to negotiating to give Bolivia sovereignty over an area of access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president, who stands for a controversial campaign next year, also has a lot to play at the verdict on Monday.
"We're close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he finally promised in August.
But analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will take Bolivia’s party — and that there would be no major changes if it did.
The UN Assembly, which has seats in the Netherlands, does not have the power to transfer Chilean territory and has stipulated that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
That the International Court of Justice cancels judgment only six months after the final arguments were heard, indicates that the case "not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have given back.
"The story of access to the sea has been capped by the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales' warrior rhetoric has done so with the remaining Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue discussions at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was abnormally fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end an era of 139 years of disagreement and gain benefits for both parties," he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as political jewelry.
"Bolivia will never abandon access rights to the Pacific," he added.
“The resignation is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not come unless they can rely on the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never overthrow their nuclear weapons if they cannot rely first on Washington.
He spoke Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with promises given during a Singapore summit between rival leaders.
His comments were given in extending that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo apparently faces a re-starting nuclear diplomacy over three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "want dream" that continued sanctions and the US's opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant for declaration, as long as Pyongyang has not first taken significant steps against disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump will have a summit more.
However, there is widespread skepticism in relation to the fact that Pyongyang is serious in terms of abolishing an arsenal that the country is most likely to see as the only thing that can guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large main clothing that you will soon be able to buy in local stores
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne lifted on the catwalk veil for a collection of distinctive headgear in extra size as part of their SS19 collection. The collection impressed at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have dominated Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
The most impressed work from Valentino was an lavish with a feather-like wide shadow covering the heads of the models.
There were also other extra great accessories, including watermelons with jewels and even an pineapples - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks — right in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had combined lips that reminded more about Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled diverging with snoring and mask, and others resembled a melted waffle.
And if you continue the great fashion cements, you are lucky.
Stiles predict that the huge hats could get to shops near you.
The giant hats arrive in the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60 centimetre wide shadow, which is seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratakijkowski.
The cult badge that is behind the most impractical hate spread across the social media has sent a new large creation down the catwalk - a beach bag in the straw that is almost as large as the model that showcases it.
The orange bass case with bass fringes and a white leather handle was the most conspicuous in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to ERROR: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in ordinary shops next summer. The designer has had such a great influence that it becomes hard to ignore the demand for accessories in huge size."
John Edward: Language skills are essential to global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have many great academic results behind them, and it remains in 2018 with yet another number of outstanding exam results, which, above all, are strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other efforts in the local community.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their students and parents.
The independent schools try to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can combine and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we experience that modern languages remain a popular topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it hits his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it affects the heart."
It is an important reminder that we can not only stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can look at the latest exam results this year that language is highest in the statistics with most passed exams in the independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages got the high grade A.
The data collected by SCIS' 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students received the character A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French, and 63 percent of those studying Spanish also received an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important competences that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now perceived as subject choice at the same level as STEM topics (science, technology, engineering and maths) in independent schools curriculum and elsewhere.
A study conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills conducted in 2014 found that among the reasons why employers could not employ vacancies, 17% had no language skills to do.
Therefore, language skills become more and more important in preparing young people for their future careers.
More job opportunities will in the future require language skills, and these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career they choose, they have, if they have learned another language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this one.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a leap to competitors.
According to a YouTube poll with over 4,000 adverts in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to lead a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important to invest in language education for those who are children today.
When speaking multiple languages, especially languages from developing countries, children are given a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, there are schools in which languages are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most important for the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to delivering a learning environment that prepares children and provides them with the skills required to succeed regardless of what the future offers.
At present, it cannot be denied that language continues to be really important for the country’s future in a global business environment, and it should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this award to Scotland’s youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron gets debut for Laker's Sunday in San Diego
The wait time is almost over for fans who will see LeBron James play their first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play on Sunday's opening match before the season start against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it doesn’t matter how many minutes he plays.
"It will be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James most likely won't play the whole game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans in relation to Lakers' scheduled six games before the season start.
“Where I am in my career, I don’t have to fight until the season start to get ready,” he said.
Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a strip voter meeting tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first out of five planned election meetings next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on confirmation of Trump’s appointed judge of the vacant seat at the Supreme Court is set in the fight, Trump is trying to create support for the upcoming mid-term elections because Republicans are at a risk of losing control of Congress when votes are made in November.
When is Trump’s election meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump's election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is held at midnight (Danish time) the night between Saturday, November 29, and Sunday, November 30, 2018.
You can watch Trump's election meeting in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely talk about this week's hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court. The hearings were appealed because of allegations of sexual abusive behavior, and the expected vote in the Senate on confirmation is set in a bero for a week, while the FBI investigates the charges.
But the primary goal of this strip voter session is to create momentum for Republicans who face a very strong election in November.
“People from President Trump’s campaign team said that the five election meetings next week are aimed at “creating energy among volunteers and supporters when Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and representatives’ houses,” Reuters said.
"Control over Congress is so important for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible, now where we enter the busy campaign time," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who would not be quoted by name, to Reuters.
Aften’s election meeting is held at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month, Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to step up to give him a boost in polls,” Simon Haeder, who deals with state science at West Virginia University, said in a statement.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team U.S. has shown martial arts and tries to keep hope alive before Sunday's singles duel
After three one-sided rounds, Saturday’s four-man dolls or maybe that’s what Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momental money is a completely through invented sports concept, but a concept that players believe in — not least at competitions like this.
Where would they say there are moments now?
"They brought six points, and now it's four, so we'll see it a little bit like momentum," said Jordan Spieth, before holding the evening.
Europe, of course, has the advantage. They are 4 points ahead, and there are 12 points more to play about.
As Spieth says, Americans feel that they have little wind in the sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both can boast with three points of four possible points.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The high vowels became higher as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important cushion, which secured victory in the duel four, although he and Thomas had been two battles behind two duels.
His pillow, which secured them the battle of the hollow 15, was met with a similar war - the kind of war that shows that he does not believe the American team is out of the competition yet.
"You just need to find the inner strength forward and focus on your own struggle," Spieth said.
That's all the players are back now.
18 holes in which one can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, with no doubt the biggest story from Ryder Cup.
Europe's notable, but sympathetic couples have received four points in four games, and appear flawless.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't get a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped the bogey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way the energy apparently floats on both to and from the wild audience, shows that it is them, it will be hardest to beat Sunday. And it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory is determined by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun descends across the Le Golf National.
Every time, it's synchronized on each of their holes.
It is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a brief process against Sergio Garcia, the morning completely in the four-mandullers, when he formed pairs with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes dug the Spanish and Swedish into a hole, they were never near to get out of.
On Sunday there is no one who can help you out of your cave.
The games with four balls and two teams a two players are so fascinating to look at close teams because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way, the strategy lightning fast can change.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a significant lead before the last day, but the four-mandullers have also shown that Team USA has the most combative, particularly in the United States.
Europe creates lead of 10-6 ahead of last day in Ryder Cup
Europe has a great advantage before the last day at Ryder Cup, after coming out of Saturday's footballs and waterfalls with a lead over the United States of America of 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the road by two victories over a trick Tiger Woods and has then scored four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, trying to win the pod, lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated over an unpredicted American team in the morning's football and won the series 3-1.
The United States made more resistance in waterfalls. They won four games, but were still behind.
Jim Furyk's team should use eight points in Sunday's 12 single games if they are to keep the bag.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari who together have received the nickname "Milliwood" is after a sensational weekend the only other couple in Ryder Cup history who have won four points in their first four games.
They crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in footballs and then defeated elegantly a discouraged Woods and American debutist Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought through the first two games on Saturday, had little ingenious glimpses, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 games in football and football and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well-prepared for the morning's football and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in waterfalls and got a 2-1 win over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, which is number three in the world.
Europe has it, however, as they want it, on a light blowing day southwest of Paris.
Three-fold major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They had a hard-to-do 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in football and returned and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in waterfalls after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in Ryder Cup history that a team has fought back after being behind with four points before the singles games. Since Furyks currently has the trophy, they will only be able to achieve it in order to keep it.
After being second in two days, however, it seems that they can’t master a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says they will not defeat unilaterally if there is no trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the UN that continued sanctions reinforce their disapproval to the United States and that the country will not abandon their nuclear weapons unilaterally under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the worldwide organization's General Assembly that North Korea had exhibited "very good will" in recent years, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, settling an area to nuclear tests and promising not to further develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We haven’t seen a similar reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will take the first step and defeat unilaterally.”
While Ri re-elected North Korean complaints of Washington's opposition to a "fascist" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps. But his speech seemed important, as it did not clearly reject unilateral disarmament, as it had previously been the case from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, in which Kim promised to work "atomic disarmament on the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has requested a formal end to the Korean War, which appeared in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang should first abandon their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown opposition to softening international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament first' and expands the pressure on sanctions to achieve their purpose by force and even opposes the 'the declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to the knees is a dream among people who don’t know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions reinforce our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a summit more between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: “If the nuclear disarmament was to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so fixed.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ris's speech was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that firing North Korea rockets against the U.S. mainland was inevitable, after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rock man" on suicide.
Last year, Trump threatened in the UN with "total destruction" by North Korea, but this year he praised Kim to exhibit against disarmament, but said that there is still a lot to be done and that sanctions need to remain until North Korea defeats.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a schedule for these actions, but said, "It's just as much if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday that the UN Security Council should maintain sanctions with conviction and error until we achieve the total final confirmed nuclear disarmament.
The Security Council has unanimously increased the economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang missile and nuclear weapons program.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sideline during the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times over the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, while North Korea only a few hours after accused him of running "serious demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile plant and a nuclear complex if the United States took "similar steps."
He said Kim had told him that the "similar steps" he demanded were the security lifts that Trump gave in Singapore, as well as movements against a normalization of Washington's relationship.
Studying at Harvard takes the course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all bachelor students more sleep. The purpose of the course is to counteract the growing macho culture, where studying throughout the night kept up large amounts of caffeine.
A researcher has shown that students at the world’s best universities often don’t know the first thing about caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has made the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was given the idea of the course after holding an examination of the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"When the building was finished, a girl came up to me and said, "Why do I first get this to know when I'm at the candidate?"
"She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, offered for the first time this year, explains how good sleeping habits can improve your academic and sporting performance as well as your overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and CEO of the university’s health area, said the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hourly course consists of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises, there is a picture of a college room where students must click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to gain knowledge of the effects of caffeine and light, and how even sports performance is influenced by sleep deprivation, and how important good sleeping habits are.
In another part of the course, participants hear about how sleep deprivation over a long period of time increases the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map of campuses.
“We know it won’t change the student’s behavior immediately.
But we think they have the right to know it - as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," said Professor Czeisler.
The pride that is taking a "allnighter" still exists, he says and adds that modern technology and increased pressure on students have resulted in sleep deprivation being a growing problem.
The "secret weapon" against stress, exhaustion and anxiety is good and adequate sleep, he said — it even counteracts weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes the brain to think that you are starving why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiar who studies chemical and physical biology, helped last year Professor Czeisler organize the course when he took one of his courses on his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and made him work to do it to a general course at the entire university.
He hopes that the next one will be that all diplomats are offered a similar course before continuing their education.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to set an alarm so they know when to sleep and when to open up. This can create awareness of the harmful effects of the light from electronic displays that can move at the rhythm of the day and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goals from Menga lower Gerrard and co.
Rangers suffered another defeat on the outfield, when Dolly Mengas's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's uncomplicated team had to take thanks with a defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was looking for their first victory on the outfield since the 4-trium on St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard the only second defeat in 18 games as a coach. Thus, eight points up to Hearts in the first place of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangers team could not answer.
Rangers are now smoking down in a sixth place, while Livingston claims up in a third place after Hibernian with only the goal score to a difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to the Rangers, as the Calum Spence line judgments had to be treated after being hit in the head by a cast object, which seemed to come from the outside section.
Gerrard made eight changes to the position that reached the Betfed Cups semifinal by tons past Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, pointed out the same 11, shaved a point of Hearts' lead last week, and he would have delighted to see his sharp team exhausted the opponents throughout the field.
Rangers had the ball most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should have scored two minutes inside the game, when Mengas's first delivery sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder's attempt was steep past.
A free kick in depth from Keaghan Jacobs found his way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive player Alan Lithgow fired past the rear post.
Rangers took control, but played more hope than ability in the attack game.
Alfredo Morales was not satisfied when Judge Steven Thomson admitted the columbians' appeals for a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless broke up after a quarter of the game.
Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Rangers goalman Liam Kelly did not have problems with Lassana Coulibaly’s lead shot and Ovie Ejaria’s tame shot.
Although Livis's opening in the 34th minute was somewhat random, it must be said to be deserved for their efforts alone.
Again, Rangers could not handle a dead-bold situation in the depths of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took the time to find Menga, who could easily kick it in the goal.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which almost instantly gave pot, as the whistle player sent the ball into Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the team to play on their paragraphs with many long balls up the field from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have expanded the lead in the last part of the game, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with safe hand, before Lithgow headed next to goal.
Rangers' incurs Glenn Middleton once again appealed for a late penalty kick after being dry with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked at this other way.
Book of the Year: The inventor of the geigertæller
And now a page from the book "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today - if we were TÆLLER... - was the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would lead to the apparatus known as the geiger eye.
The Geigertellellen has become a solid component of both science and popular culture, as it could be seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans had the lead roles of Bondian scientists:
Man: “What in the world is that?”
Rogers: "It's a geiger shell, which is used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you take these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms, as the radioactivity of the minerals makes.”
Evans: “Hold up, now it’s over!”
"His" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have filled 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then "see" the protein that is common to many cancers and where they are injected again
A test vaccine is promising in patients with a number of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from patients and changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein by the name HER2, as many cancer forms have, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “gets several cancers to develop,” including breast, egg tick, lung and bowel cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach in which immune cells are taken out of patients and "teachers" them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West held Trump-friendly speech wearing an MAGA hat after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go well.
After an uncomplicated performance in Saturday Night Live, Kanye West was cut off when he hailed US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
When he played the third song in the evening of Ghost Town wearing a Make America Great Again cake, he began a duel against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
"I speak so often with white people who say, 'Why do you like Trump, he's racist?'
“But if I worried about racism, I would have long since moved from the United States,” he said.
SNL started the evening's show with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made laugh with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's assault charges.
Although the recordings were not shown, comedian Chris Rock Wests uploaded the scores on social media.
It is uncertain whether Rock tried to exhibit West by putting the recordings up.
West also complained to the public about poor treatment backstage due to its main clothing.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat."
They bullied me!
And they said I was sunk deep," he said.
West continued: “Do you want to see how deep I am sunk?” and said he wanted to take his Superman cup on because it means that “You can’t decide what to do. Do you want progress in the world?
Try with love.”
The audience lived at least two times by his comments, and the SNL staff allowed to be embarrassingly affected, says Variety with a comment from a person who was present: "There was been a fine in the study."
West had been booked as a substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose then girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West confused many by performing with the song I Love It, while dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest people: DO NOT BE AT LADE YOU GET A PUBLEN.”
Talkshow-very Karen Hunter tweeted that West just "is like he is, and that's fine."
“But I don’t choose to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or his support “art”), who embraces and pours out an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's a law.
And that’s what we have, too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced that he has taken the name change to "the entity officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and thus follows Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg has named Snoop Lion, and the newly deceased musician Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formly Known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington longs after toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for swinging swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor longs out after the stereotypical macho hero and says that the kind of TV character means that young men often feel that they must be hard to be respected.
Kit said to Sunday Times Culture that he believes there is "get something wrong" and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie on 31, admitted that the problem lies him "very angry."
“For the time, it’s very much on my mind — where have we gone wrong in the city with masculinity?” he said.
“If we look at the current problems, what are we learning young men in their upbringing?”
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characteristics.
He continued: “What is congenital, and what is added?
What do young men learn from television and on the street that makes them feel like they are men in this way?
I think it’s one of our time big questions, how do we change it?
It is obvious that something has gone wrong for young men.”
During the interview, he also admitted that he will not make successors to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that he is "good with battlefields and horses."
Kit plays from November in a remake of Sam Shepards True West, which is the story of a film director and his brother, who is the thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers it to have met his wife Rose as the best of the game of Thrones experience.
“I met my wife because of this series, so it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever,” he said.
Rose played Ygrette, as Kits character, Jon Snow, falls in love with the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has published a 14% increase in the number of people with HIV and AIDS.
More than 800,000 people in the country are affected, according to the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were recorded.
Most of the new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV this way has been reduced to something close to zero, Chinese health authorities say at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In one year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalized, but discrimination against LGBT individuals is a common phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry before or since with women because of the country's conservative values.
Many cases of infection are due to the lack of contraception in these conditions.
China’s government has since 2003 promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff leaked data about Republican Senators and torts against "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Member of the House of Representatives Maxine Waters denied on Saturday allegations that a member of her staff has shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claimed that the allegations stemmed from websites and backed by the "most right-wing" right-wing.
"The lies, lies, and more terrible lies," Waters wrote in a Twitter post.
The published information contained allegedly home addresses and phone numbers on U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill. It took place during a hearing in the Senate concerning accusations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
It happened after the three senators had sought Kavanaugh.
Conservative support sites such as Gateway Putint of RedState announced that the IP addresses pointed out that the information had been posted by Waters' people, after which they published information about a member of Waters staff.
“This unfounded accusation is completely unhealthy and a direct lie,” Waters continued.
“Member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false charges, is in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This unfavorable accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie."
Waters’ release quickly received criticism online, including from former press secretary in the White House Ari Fleischer.
"It's an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
"It suggests that she doesn't have the right temperament to be a Congressman.
If you are accused of something you haven’t done, don’t be angry.
You don't have to be daunting.
You must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
You have to keep your mind.”
Fleischer was able to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, who was criticised for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to take over Waters' place in the mid-term elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Great, if it's true," he tweeted.
In Waters’ official statement, she says that her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and the order power regarding these fraudulent claims."
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are found," she continued. "And that they will be held legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone and everyone in my staff."
Announcement of Johnny English strikes again - incumbent spy comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in any newer film with a British one, and it also seems relevant for the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will dry, sarcastic self-sateira, if how greasy it is with us, will the country's new export opportunity be?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and the big eyes have been given his permission to make roars re-open the dough. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comical meeting aimed at places where the cinematographers do not speak English.
Of course, he is the tumped secret agent, who, despite his desire to be a lost gentleman, has a little Clouseau, a knife tip Mr. Bean and proper cloth of him who performed a single tone to the Charriots of Fire singing at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He is also originally based on the worldwide and international luxurious bays that left chaos in his wake, after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television commercials.
There are some good moments in this last shot on the tribe from JE.
I loved when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the propellers dressed against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical chemistry, but humor feels quite overwhelming and strangely superfluous, especially now where more "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer compelling comics as an ingredient.
Humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy adventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film fictions in the role of Mr. Bean.
The infinite starting point for the film is that the UK is in serious trouble.
An internet hacker has infiltrated England's two secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the English agents in the field to the horror of the responsible agent, unfortunately a very small role to Kevin Eldon.
It is the last chance for a pompous and combat-ready prime minister, who already suffers a complete fall in political popularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work on in the manuscript.
When her security advisers inform her that every active spy has been revealed, she has been forced to repeal someone’s pension.
And of course, it's the clumsy Johnny English, who is now a school inspector at an upper-class school, but who in hiding teaches how to become a secret agent. There are some fun sequences here when English stands for a kind of School of Rock education in spyage.
English has returned to an emergency meeting at Whitehall and reunited with its hard tried former right hand Bough, which is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now been married to an overentatusian but well-motivated submarine crew - a role played by Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the royal intelligence service is shared about Batman and Robin back, as they meet Olga Kurylenko’s beautiful femme fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is snugly close to being enraged by the charismatic and terrifying tech-milliard Jason Volta — the game of Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve England’s computer problems.
English and Bough start their furiously risky creatures: disguised as servants, they set fire to a pre-order French restaurant; they create chaos, as they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English creates pure silhouette as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with Volta's house.
All the guns are fired in the film's final sequence, but how well-meaning and energetic it is, there is a sense of child television over it.
Correctly mediocre.
And as I could not avoid thinking about the other Johnny English films: Can the English film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that gives his talent justice?
Labour rejects the fact that barrage with a plan of four-day work week with unchanged salary to the British
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour is said to consider a radical plan, so the English can be closely aligned with a four-day work week, but get paid for five.
The party will allegedly have business leaders to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to provide employees with an extra day of work.
This would mean that the employees would have three days of weekend without going into pay.
Sources say that the idea would vote over the party's economic goals to pull the country in a more favorable direction for the workers.
Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day work week as a way for workers to benefit from an economy change.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party said to The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published by the end of the year."
"It won't happen in a day, but a four-day work week is a goal that fits with the party's access to change the economy of the workers' advantage and to the party's overall strategy for industry."
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea as the Green Party proposed a four-day work week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, the objective is not supported by a unanimous majority in the Labour Party.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party said: “A four-day work week is not the party’s policy and is not under consideration in the party.”
Labour's shadow finance minister John McDonnell spent the last week's party meeting drawing up his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell says he is determined to fleet power back from "anonymous directors" and "exploit" in supply companies.
The Government’s plans also doubt whether the current shareholders in water supply companies will get their money back, as a government with Labour in the grid could “requite” them in the light of immoral acts.
He also confirmed plans to get workers in corporate governance and to create including ownership funds, which will award 10 percent of private companies’ share value to employees, who are expected to receive up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh can change their voice
The FBI investigation on accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week. And it raises the question of whether the FBI’s meeting could have the Republican senators to pull their support.
In an interview that was shown on Sunday, 60 Minute journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig something that could make them change their attitude.
Kennedy was more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
“When I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened - after the accusations came forward - and said, "Do you think so?"
He was steel-seat, determined and unique.”
Graham’s voice seems to be in the stone.
“I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and others would require a very violent accusation,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know Brett denied it at the most powerful," Graham added with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of them, she said, could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I can't see that it would change anything."
What is the Global Citizens Festival, and has it done something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York host city for the Global Citizens Festival is an annual music festival with a very impressive offering of artists and an equally impressive goal; to make an end to the world’s poverty.
The Global Citizens Festival will receive tens of thousands of people on the Central Park’s big lawns, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will provide attention to the real goal that is to make an end to extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project, an international interest organization that struggles to make an end to poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concerters must perform a series of tasks or "actions". For example, make voluntary work, write to a world leader, make a phone call or another meaningful action that can create awareness about the goal of making an end to poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been, now where have 12 years to reach the goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert real change, or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism" - that is, people feel that they make a difference by signing a signature collection online or making a Twitter look?
Global Citizen reports that since 2011 they have registered more than 19 million "actions" from their members aimed at different goals.
They believe that these actions have spurred world leaders to make binding objectives and policy actions that correspond to more than 37 billion dollars, which by 2030 are expected to have affected more than $225 billion.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 objectives and actions that had been due to their actions, which ran up to over $10 billion, which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that these funds have continued to have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main objectives is The Power of Nutrition, which has been started in England and is a collaboration between investors and traders. They strive to “ help children survive their full potential” and promise 35 million dollars to alleviate nutritional problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the help of the English government, donors, other country governments and world citizens who you can social injustice with malnutrition become a footnote in the history books,” said the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the public at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the Government of England has promised funds to improve nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 calls online. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with advice on nutrition.
In response to one of the website’s frequently asked questions, “What makes you think we can make an end to extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen wrote: “It will be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we will stumble and make mistakes.
But like the civil rights movement and the movements against apartheid, it will succeed because we are stronger together.”
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performances of this year’s festival in New York. Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman must be hosts.
The U.S. can use its fleet to "block" Russian energy exports, says U.S. Interior Minister
"If necessary, Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, also in the Middle East, reveals U.S. interior minister Ryan Zinke, to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, especially where they operate on invitations from the legal government, is a pretext to expand the sale of their energy.
“I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in East and South Europe,” he said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
“The United States has with our fleet the opportunity to ensure that there is free passage on the sea roads, and if necessary, we can also block them so that we ensure that their energy does not come on the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to participants at a meeting that Consumer Energy Alliance - a nonprofit organization that considers itself "the voice of U.S. energy consumption" - held.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying that they are basically alike.
“The economic opportunities in relation to Iran and Russia are about to exploit and replace fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-trick pony,” whose economy relies on fossil fuels.
These statements come after the Trump administration aimed at increasing the European export of liquid natural gas to replace Russia, which is far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
In order to achieve this, spokespersons for the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 management project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin the "fool" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion animal Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is only an economic project.
Kremlin believes that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is an expression of unequal competitive conditions and is simply due to economic considerations.
"I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool to exert pressure, and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose supplier," said Russian Minister of Energy, Aleksandr Novak, at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with the U.S. Energy Minister, Rick Perry, in September.
The position of the Americans is met by criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, BDI, has asked the US to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third party interfering in our energy supplies," said the head of BDI, Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "surprisingly" to run for the 2020 presidential election, said the Senator of Massachusetts
The Senator of the Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" to run for the presidential election after the mid-term election, she said on Saturday.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering setting up.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it takes a woman in front,” she said.
"After November 6, I will strongly consider running for the presidential election."
Warren made his opinion about President Donald Trump to know during the city council and said he "do the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm deeply concerned about that, Donald Trump does in our democracy," she said.
Warren has been quoted in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote: "Of course, the FBI will investigate the matter before the vote."
A poll from Thursday shows that the majority of Warren's own backyard does not believe that she will be setting up in 2020.
According to a poll by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not set up.
32% supported the possible candidate.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick by 38% for and 48% against a possible position.
Other high-profile democratic candidates discussed in the 2020 presidential election count among former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he will announce his final decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palins PTSD at a presidential meeting for Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through after he has come home makes me able to relate to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers return home,” she told the audience to a Trump meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest for "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and become harder. They go and think about it, their colleagues on land and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, in order to prevent the notification of domestic violence and to be in possession of a weapon in the intoxicated state, says Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the police in Wasillas.
18 States and D.C. oppose new asylum law
18 States and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new U.S. law that refuses asylum to victims fleeing violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and D.C. delivered a partial declaration to support an asylum seeker who opposes the law, according to NBC News.
The applicant's full name in the trial Grace vs. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union issued in August against the federal law, has not been published.
She said her partner "and his violent sons who are band members" had abused her, but U.S. officials refused her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of U.S. asylum seekers stutter, which countries with wide-ranging problems with ties and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum law called for a decision by the U.S. Immigration Board in 2014 that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District of Columbia's Attorney General, Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new law "sees away from decades of state, federal and international law."
“The federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be determined based on relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle goes against the principle,” the party independent statement states.
Lawyers argued in the statement also that the law of rejecting immigrants damages the American economy, as there is a higher probability that they become independent and "liver necessary labour."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions dismissed immigration judges the right to give asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asyl is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political stance,” Sessions said in his statement of the law on 11 June.
It has never been intended that asylum should remedy all problems - or just all serious problems - that people around the world face every day.
While the death toll is doubled, attempts to find survivors in Palu are desperate
For survivors, the situation was only worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while comforting her little fever-rammed boy at an evacuation center in the ruined town of Palu.
Every minute the ambulance comes in with the body.
We lack clean water.”
The settlers returned to their broken homes to sort in soaked possessions and save what they could find.
Several hundred people were killed, and the hospitals, which were also hit by the earthquake of 7.5, could not follow.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, lay outside Palus military hospital, where patients are treated outdoors due to heavy aftershocks.
He had tears in his eyes when he told me how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was masturbated against a broken wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was going to wedding in the city.
“I heard my wife yelling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of unfinal methods and propaganda adverts
A week after a Chinese newspaper brought a four-page advert in a US newspaper that hit drum for the benefits of an American-Chinese collaboration, U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday to China Daily’s paid entry in Des Moines Register — Iowa’s best-selling newspaper — after accusing China of interfering with the November 6 Congressional election.
U.S. officials say Trump's accusation of Chinese interference in the U.S. election marks a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked up in an escalating trade war where they have put customs on each other's import goods.
China's trade war retaliation duty would frame exporters in states like Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, Chinese and American experts believe.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China earlier governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has injured US workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a lead on Sunday’s Des Moines Register that China “optrapper the use of the unfined methods by driving propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government uses the proud American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of press by driving a paid ad in Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In the Chinese here in Beijing, one will only find disagreements. And you will not get a reticent picture of the Chinese people’s different attitudes to China’s worrying economic direction, as the media is under tight control from the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to release" his article, even though he did not say what.
Republicans leave women ahead of the mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh case, warns analysts
While many top Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh against accusations of sexual assault, analysts warn that they will experience a counterattack in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The story has put the emotions in the keg, and most Republicans have already announced that they would like to see the voting process continue.
"This cannot be done," Grant Reher, professor of political science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article Saturday.
Reher said he doubted that Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona) requested an FBI investigation for 11 hours will relieve anger voters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday — they don’t forget it tomorrow or November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to The Hill on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protesters shouted during a demonstration in the Senate: "November comes!", when the Republicans controlling the court committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the witness statement by Professor Christine Blasey Ford.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach new heights," said independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg to the news media.
“People say it has already reached a high level; it’s right.
But it can reach even higher, especially among female swingers in the suburbs and younger voters - 18-29-year-olds - who rarely vote, despite not liking the president."
Even before Ford’s public accusations of the sexual assault of the Supreme Court, analysts had pointed out that it could give a backlash if the Republicans continued with the nomination.
"It has become a worse mess for Republicans," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote of the committee or the final result, or whether Kavanaugh is being made accountable; it’s also about how Republicans have handled it here and how they’ve dealt with her,” Guy Cecil, president of Priories USA, points out.
But the Americans seem to have shared attitudes about who they should believe in after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, where the latter has a little more on its side.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents probably believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh was either probably or certainly lying under his testimony, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
The FBI is now investigating the accusations presented by Ford and at least one other, Deborah Ramirez told The Guardian.
Ford last week told the Senate Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh was in full custody on her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her gender parts to a party when they both studied at Yale in the 80s.
The inventor of the internet plans to make a new internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, launches a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lees’ open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the plan with Inrupt is "worldlord".
“We have to do it now,” he said about the start-up business.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solids technology, so people can make their own "personal online data collection" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, two-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is, as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What’s unique about the personal online data collection is that it’s entirely up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea of Inrupt is according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, to collect resources, processes and abilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contracts and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralized apps using the available tools on the Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team don’t speak with “Facebook or Google about whether they should change it completely, so all their business models are suddenly getting redundant.”
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a look at the Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupts “mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new internet built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the internet when he started the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will still be inventor and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I am incredibly optimistic about the next period of the Internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Honorable recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War I
The only priest who won the Victoria Cross by fighting during World War I is celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel Colonel and priest Bernard Wann won the order on September 29, 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and never knew he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday, a memorial was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said that it was "unbelievably symbolic", that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's orderful business.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann d. 29 September 1918 led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick train and under heavy fire from machine guns and artillery."
He later ran to the front line and led with the "greatest man's maturity" his people forward, before attacking alone an artillery career and injuring three guns.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann of 72 said that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother James Vann also made a crane after the parade, which was featured by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "feeled very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people emphasizes the true heroism."
MMA fans were up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead got Gurli Gris
Imagine you’ve been up all night to see the star-packed Bellator 206 and then being refused to see the main event.
There were 13 games on the program from San Jose, including six games on the main program, and they were shown the night through England on Channel 5.
At 6 o’clock in the morning when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to meet each other, the viewers of England were somewhat surprised when the transmission shifted to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimposed after they had woken up to early morning for this battle.
A Twitter fan described the shift to a children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke."
“According to the legislation, this content was not appropriate at 6 o’clock in the morning, why they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president when asked about the broadcast.
"'Grisen Gurli', yes."
Bellator's CEO, Scott Coker, said that they will work to earn English viewers in planning ahead.
“When thinking about the recycling, I think well, we can make it work,” Coker said.
“But the clock is six Sunday morning there, and we don’t find a solution to it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the case.
Believe me when the shift was changed, I got a lot of messages, and they weren’t all friendly.
We tried to repair it. We thought it was a technical mistake.
But that was actually the law.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We are close to five games instead of six, which we normally do. We tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had "minor" over sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt less worth than anyone else in his growth due to his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said it didn't go up to him until he came into the larger classes that "all are not like me."
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hab."
He also said he went less up to win the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The regular host of the radio program, which has been running for a long time, Kirsty Young, has taken free of a few months due to illness.
Daley was a guest in Laverne's first program and said he felt "less worth" than everyone else in his upbringing because "it was not socially accepted to like boys and girls."
He said: “For now, the feelings of feeling worthy and feeling differently have been the things that have given me strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they learned his sexuality to know.
The double Olympic bronze winds have become a highly profiled LGBT fighters and used their participation at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for a decriminalization of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences, and he wanted to give others "hope."
The third world champion said he had been "overraced" when he fell in love with a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner who was 20 years older than him, but told me that the age difference had never been a problem.
He told me that it’s hard to find someone at the same age who has experienced similar op and downturns when going through so much at such a young age — he took to his first Olympic at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June, the couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "heel his perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would be all about winning a gold medal," he said.
“But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 as a 40-year-old after diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley told me that his father did not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had received tickets for London 2012 - when he wanted to sit on the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t be there at that time.
I kept his hand when his breathing stopped, and it first went up to me that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a home audience at the Olympics. There was nothing that could beat that feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first song selection — Proud of Heather Small — which had meant much during the act of the Olympics and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Oskar Mickelson on the bench of Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson puts a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he has to do something about the form if it is not going to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who set a record for the 12th time to join the competition that was held every 2 years, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk because of Saturday's football and waterfalls.
Instead of being in the center of the events of the United States as usual, the five-fold great winner had to act on his game in the hopes of correcting the viewers.
Even at the height of his career, he had the most straight drive, why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match for the field at Le Golf National, where the long Rough often punishes wild-fleet shots.
And if the track was not a big enough mouth, Mickelson at the ninth match on Sunday will meet the always precise winner of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who has joined newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans who start the 12 single games start strong, Mickels’ fight can be crucial.
Furyk did not express surprising confidence in his teammate.
"He understood his role completely today, gave me a flap on my back, laid my arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a great faith in himself.”
He is in the Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams before and also this week.
I didn't think he would play two games.
I thought he was going to play more, but that’s how it went, and that’s how it would be.
He wants to be out there like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson beat Nick Fallos record for most games in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never been able to measure itself with his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven undefeated, although Furyk said that his presence contributes to something undefeated.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, witty, he likes to run to people, and he's good to have in the team room," he explained.
“I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than just the game.”
Europe's Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that great lead can quickly disappear
The European Captain Thomas Bjørn by experience that a solid lead before the last day of the Ryder Cups single-up can quickly become nerve-piring.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a leap of five points over the Americans, but was just being obtained before the finish line with a score of 141⁄2-131⁄21⁄21⁄2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice lead in Valderrama, we had a nice lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we just exactly won,” says Bjørn after seeing the 2018 team win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday to a total lead of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it is not over.
It's going to have a whole cold tomorrow.
Go out and do everything right.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it’s trying to win the trophy, and that’s where our focus lies.
I’ve always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we’re also aware of what’s on the other side — the best golfers in the world.”
Alongside his players’ performance on a hard track, Bjørn added: “I don’t take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow is the individual performance that counts, and that’s something completely different.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when it goes well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re tested on all the parameters as a golfer.
That's what players need to understand - get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, because he will also get the best out of himself.”
Second, it looks like the opponent Jim Furyk, who hopes for better individual performance than in the partner game except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk has experienced a turn on the last day. First on the winning team in Brookline before losing, when Europe made the "Miraclet of Medinah".
"I remember every word," he said when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 had spoken to his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to have a good start as you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
Once the momentum has found a direction, it puts a great pressure on the intermediate struggles.
We combine our team in relation to it and put the players on the field in the order we feel for. We try to create magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has been assigned to lead the backlash and stands for Rory McIlroy in the top match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half.
“I chose this group of players in this order because I think it ensures us all the way through,” Bjørn said about his choice of single players.
Germany's new warship was re-elected.
The German fleet’s latest frigate would have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War, but the Germans must wait at least one year yet due to technical problems and an escalating price.
The deployment of the largest ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been postponed to the first half of 2019 according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a spokesman from the military.
The ship would have become part of the fleet in 2014, but after delivery problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, will replace the aging frigates from the Bremen class.
If they know that they want a powerful gun, a large range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the latest frigates is a minor need for maintenance: it should be possible to have the frigates away from the home ports for up to two years.
But the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships - which will eventually make Germany appear as an oversea power factor - will already be obsolete when they are inserted, writes Die Zeit.
The failed F125 commander created headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship in use and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the fleet delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
It was not known much about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned a number of crucial "software and hardware errors", which made the warship unusable in combat situations.
Software flaws were of particular importance when the ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are to be controlled by a crew of 120 sailors - only half of the crew of the older Bremen gatters.
It also proved that the ship was too heavy, reducing its performance and limited fleet opportunity for future updates.
The 7,000 tonnes heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during the Second World War.
In addition to hardware errors, the price of the project that includes learning of the crew is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached staggering 3.1 billion € (3.6 billion), with an initial price of $22 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's fleet power screws.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German government's defence committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet "runs out of occupation-ready ships."
The official said the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of use without being replaced.
He complained that none of the frigates from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of the Flags
New research from an area in the Scottish Highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and will help in the work of future conservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scientists from Scotland’s National Trust and follows common bats, dwarf bats, long-haired bats and water storage mice at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed in carefully selected locations in the area to record the activities of the bats throughout the season.
Data is also collected by NTS staff and volunteers using handheld detectors.
Deep-moving analyses of sound recordings will reveal the frequencies of the bats and show which species does what.
To produce a detailed landscape image of their behavior, a report is made and a map of the habitat.
NTS Rob Dewar’s conservation adviser hopes that the results reveal which areas of the habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help determine the benefits of habitat-related efforts such as the establishment of meadows, and how to best preserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined drastically over the past 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect the reds and limit their habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger. The same can fly springs, chemical treatment of building materials and attack from pets.
In fact, fissure is not blind.
But because they primarily hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an advanced echo localization technique to find insects and fly without obstacles.
NTS, which is responsible for the conservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 77,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect nests and sometimes make rescue operations.
The organization has even made Scotland’s first and only dedicated flag museums reserve at the area around Threeave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten of Scotland’s flag museums.
The area is responsible for David Thompson, says it is an ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threeave we have a really good area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and the whole good habitat.
There’s a lot you don’t know about bats, so work here and elsewhere can help understand what they need to thrive.”
He emphasizes the importance of looking for bats before making maintenance tasks on properties, as the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and young people.
Flagermus is peace, and it is illegal to kill, genes or disturb them or their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project manager for the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to give a hand.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we have, we don't know how the populations evolve."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers sue German journals
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape charges against him for "fake news" and says that people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news media Der Spiegel, who brought the accusations.
Angriberen from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that he paid her $375,000 to keep it secret, wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
Some hours after the allegations had been published, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticized the information for being "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-fold winner of Ballon d'Or to the camera.
“They will promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They will be famous by saying my name, but it’s part of the job.
I am a happy man, and everything is good," the player smiled.
Ronaldos lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel because of the charges they have called “an inexplicable publication of suspicions about the privacy affair.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral corruption in a class similar to the accusation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident occurred in June 2009 at a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting each other at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her in an anal way, according to the filed report in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "a good guy 99% of the time" the grip of "one percent."
The paper states that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographed her injuries to a hospital, but that she later agreed to an agreement outside the court because she felt "bange of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly exhumed".
The 34-year-old now says that she will reverse the agreement as she is still deeply influenced by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo faced a shift from Manchester United to Real Madrid, when the incident would have taken place, and changed this summer to the Italian Grand Club Juventus for €100 million.
Brexit: UK "will forever regret" to lose auto manufacturers
Britain "will regret it forever," if it lost its status as a leading car manufacturer worldwide after Brexit, Minister of Business Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "extremely", that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would lower production temporarily at Burnaston's factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting hours at the border in case of a Brexit without an agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, producing Toyota’s Auris and Avenis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, with 90% of these exported to the rest of the EU.
"As I see it, production will stop at our factory, if Britain smokes out of the EU at the end of March," said CEO of Burnaston, Marvin Cooke.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, express fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on trade across the border.
For example, BMW says they will close their Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers has to do with the risks of supply chain in the event of an exit without agreement.
Toyota’s production runs on a tight schedule, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems could arise at the border, which, according to the automotive industry, can lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day of production at Derbyshire factory, and then production would be stopped, the firm said.
Clark says Theresa Mays Chequers plan for future negotiations with the EU is "compared, so you can accurately avoid these considerations at the border."
“We’re going to have an agreement. We want to have the best deal that doesn’t just allow us — as I call it — to enjoy our current success, but to take this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
“The statements by Toyota and other manufacturers point out that we need to be able to continue what has been successful supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but in the long term, higher prices would reduce the competitiveness of the factory, which will ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a joint trustee at the factory, says his members become more and more concerned: “My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they will not come again.”
A spokesman for the government said: “We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again,” the White House said.
Donald Trump’s important meeting with the Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein can “be postponed a week more,” as the decision on the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein looks at the special accuser Robert Mueller over the shoulder during his study of Russian electoral interference, relations between Trump’s helpers and Russia and the President’s possible obstacle to court.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy Attorney General and thereby risk Mueller's independence, it has been a gossip topic in Washington for months.
The New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein considered carrying microphones to record conversations with Trump and the opportunity to dismiss the president via the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday, he took to the White House, and the rumor went on that he would say up.
Instead, a meeting was held on Thursday with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York City.
Trump said he would "do not prefer" to fire Rosenstein. But the meeting was delayed to avoid a collapse with the Senate Judicial Committee hearing, in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault, should testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week’s FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed Senate elections.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked at the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed a week with all that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we have to see, and I always like to keep the press up to date.”
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press meetings was not due to TV journalists' games for the gallery, but added: "I disagree with the fact that they play up to the camera."
She said the direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
“The banker receives more questions from the press than any president before him,” she said, adding without quoting a source: “We’ve seen the numbers.”
Press meetings will still take place,” Sanders said, “if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We're trying to give rich opportunity for it, and you've seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it's going to be in the press meeting's place when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open hearings or press meetings with high-ranking guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why, when he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the present journalists.
Health Minister contacts EU staff in Scottish health care after Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than half a year before Britain withdraws from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to paying for applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its designated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU are ongoing, and it seems that decisions are expected to be expected for the autumn.
But the British government has also increased their preparation for any Brexit without an agreement.
I know it must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the effort each employee has done, regardless of their nationality.
Collegiates from and outside the EU come with valuable experiences and competences that strengthen and improve healthcare work for patients and local communities.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we want you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie gets acute surgery after head injury
The lineback from Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie was acutely operated after having suffered a head injury on Saturday's 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores, it sounds like Tennessee's Mike Organ.
The first coach for Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the incident took place before the break.
"He went out to the sideline and just fell out there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him to further study.
A Tennessee State spokesperson told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombies operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there is no "no details of the type or extent of the injury yet", and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when he suffered the injury.
Abercrombie is studying in the second year and is starting his first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, giving him 18 tackles gathered this season.
Foreign buyers charge higher stamp tax when buying houses in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK. The extra money is required according to the Conservative Party to help the homeless.
This feature should push Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp tax will hit those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects that it will provide $120 million a year for the homeless.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy property in the UK, for the benefit of the homeless.
The tree will be considered an attempt at a response to Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper homes and going after them with the highest income.
The rise in the stamp tax will hit people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK. The deposit from here should be used for the government’s struggle to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The additional fee placed above the current stamp tax and the higher levels introduced two years ago in multi-storey purchases and purchases to rent can reach up to 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to collect 120 pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new constructions in London are bought by people living abroad, making prices rise and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "spitling cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside of the country.
The new bill comes only weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in the stamp tax to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction and construction companies to keep property prices up by buying reasons they don't use. He asked May to drop quotas on cheap homes to solve the UK's "damaging housing situation."
Corbyn has proposed an eye-catching number of residential reforms, including the control of house rent prices and the withdrawal of the landlord’s opportunity to put people on the street if they comply with the lease contract.
He will also strengthen the possibility of building public housing.
May said: “Last year I said I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life will be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it can’t be appropriate that it’s just as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy homes as too hard-working Brits.
Too many, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the inability to sleep on the street is still all too widespread."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become Scotland's coach"
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, said his "ultimative goal" is at one point to become Scotland's coach.
The score of 42 enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from North East, which now has third place in League One, three points from the top.
He switched to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back in the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a game with the B team, and that's it," said Ross BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it's always drawn in me.
This option would only occur if I’m successful in training clubs.”
Ross' predecessor as a coach for Sunderland is Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach for Alloa Athletic said he had no concerns about following such established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I'm measuring success from if I can get this club back in the Premier League."
From the structure and facilities of this club, the undoubtedly belongs at home in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task, but I just want to see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there.”
Ross is only three years into his career as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart's coaching staff.
Then he helped Alloa come back after being pushed down in the third-best row and transformed St Mirren from the downhill to the title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more fit now than he ever did during his career as a player for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was a real distinction,” he remembers about the time in Alloa.
"I honestly thought the coaching was right for me, more right than being a player.
It sounds strange because I made it fine, made sense, and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There are many things you have to do on a weekly basis.
There’s still the kind of stress and pressure as a coach, but it just feels right.
I’ve always wanted to train, and now I do, I haven’t had it more comfortable with myself throughout my adult life.”

The best time to beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., shows study
The heat wave this summer has increased the earnings for England’s pubs, but has set restaurant chains under greater pressure.
The sale of pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while the sale in restaurants has gone 4.8% down, shows figures.
Peter Martin, the company consultant at CGA and has collected the figures, said: “Fortsat sunshine and England’s unexpectedly long World Cup has meant that July follows June’s pattern, where the pubs experienced sales of 2.8%, except that the restaurants are harder hit now.
The fall of 1.8% in restaurants in June got worse in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on the sale of drinks clearly managed the best and experienced progress similar to the restaurants' decline.
Pubs with focus on food led in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
It seems that people just want something to drink.
Across pub and bar chains, the sale of drinks rose by 6.6% for the month, while food fell by 3.3%."
Paul Newman, who analyzes the service industry, said: “The results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales on the out-of-home market, weather and big social or sporting events are the biggest factors.
There is no surprise that restaurants are still struggling, although a fall in sales of 4.8% years after year will make a real evil above rising costs.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will show if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide a hard-needed breathing space.”
The total increase in sales collected for pubs and restaurants including new openings was 2.7% in July, showing the fall in newly launched brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales figures for the English pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes data from 47 different groups. Their annual turnover is more than £9 billion, and they are leading in the field.

A study of 20,000 students from the 4th grade reveals a violent growth in "false Insta" accounts - a reference to the photo sharing service Instagram.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content is being put up.
20% of students said they have a “head account” that they can show their parents while they also have private ones.
A mother who fell over his 13-year-old daughter's secret account, so a teenager who called others to "take me away".
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistress' Conference (HMC) for private schools found that 40% of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted having private accounts.
The leader of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “It’s scary that so many teenagers are tempted to make online profiles where their parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" of the Scottish Athletics board.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics at the annual General Assembly of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland’s most winning athlete, and President Ian Bettie described the shift as a good opportunity for those who make decisions about sports to benefit from her great 10-year experience at international level.
"Eididh enjoys great reputation in the athletic world of Scotland, the UK and the rest of the world, and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will benefit from getting her to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to try to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope I can contribute and help out a direction for sport in Scotland."
The American, who won two of his four Olympic gold medals in the 200 and 400-meter races at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, which is now often commentator for the BBC, could not go after a transitory ischemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: “A month ago I was hit by a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said the time would show if I wanted to get on top of it and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm really quick, have learned to go again and do today agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
Complaints for breast pump comparing mothers with cows get mixed reception online
A breast pump company has shared opinions online with an advertising that compares breastfeeding mothers with cows, such as malkes.
To mark the launch of what is said to be the first soundless breast pump in the world, the technological consumer magazine has released a sarcastic music video-inspired advertising, which will show the freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a diet filled with hay, to a song in which it reads: "Yes, I paint myself, but you see no tail" and "If you hadn't noticed it, this isn't yver, it's my breasts."
The statement reads: “Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my child, pump it out, pump it out, I paint my bark.”
However, the advertising published on the company’s Facebook page has brought controversy online.
With 77.000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed reception from the viewers. Many say it makes laugh with the "crusts" of the dairy industry.
“Very bad decision to use queues to advertise for this product.
Like us, they should be pregnant and born before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth,” wrote a user.

Another wrote: “I understand enough traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?”
Another added: “Don’t see an unsensitive advertisement.”
Others defended the advertisement. A woman admitted that she thinks the song was "unbelievably funny."
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would have had one.
Amning made me feel exactly like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It’s a brilliant product,” wrote one.
Another commented: “It’s a fun advertising targeting mothers who pump milk (often in their workplace or on toilets) and feel like ‘cooks’.
It’s not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the milk industry.”
At the end of the video, women reveal that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their bh's.
The concept behind the advertising is based on the fact that many women who breastfeed, say they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely soundless, has no tubes or hoses and fits discreetly in a nursing-bh, giving women the freedom to move, keep their children and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and CEO of Mother, wrote: “The Pump from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and milk coolers, we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping, while in an entertaining and recognizable way, the freedom the new pump can give.”
It is not the first time that the pump from Elvie has created headlines.
In London Fashion Week, a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to tent camp at Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has exploded, although the number of border owners has not changed. It is partly due to a tougher rhetoric and Trump administration scrapper laws that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared their ability to stay in the country by stilling and accepting a child.
The home sending risk rose in June, when authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household would give fingerprints, and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified that they had arrested several people who sought to sponsor unsolicited minors.
The management later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had pure criminal penalties.
“To 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors’ household stay illegally in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
So we're still chasing those people," Albence said.
In trying to treat children's cases faster, authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to meet in court within a month after their detention. Before it was within 60 days, aid workers said.
Many people use video calls instead of even meeting up and speaking their case for lawful residence to an immigration judge.
Those who are sentenced to stay are deported quickly.
The longer children become in custody, the higher the likelihood there is that they get anxiety or depression that can lead to violent outcomes or flight attempts, it reads from assistants and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
People who adopt better conditions say that these risks are more pronounced on larger facilities such as Tornillo, where the size makes it harder to keep an eye on if a child suffers.
They added that relocation to a tent village without mental preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to friends can accumulate trauma that many already struggle with.
Syria announces U.S., French and Turkish "settlement forces" that they should withdraw immediately
When Syria's foreign minister, Walid al-Moualem, spoke to the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in his eighth year.
Moualem, also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces' stay in the country is illegal and under the pretext of combating terrorism, and they will "be met with similar funds."
"They shall withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror "nearly is over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this crucial war until we have purged all Syrian areas" for both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The U.S. has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and advise Kurdish and Syrian-Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-armed country.
In the refugee area, Moualem said that the conditions were good enough for them to return home, after which he accused "some Western countries" of "sponsoring undisturbed fears," which caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help facilitate these home broadcasts," he said.
“They are investigating what would be a purely humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help to rebuild the country available before there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel-controlled city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a major attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia against the province, where three million live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military actions will go after jihadists from the Nusa Front, a protagonist of Al-Qaeda, who "will be wiped out."
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call for the first meeting of the new committee to outline a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for an election.
Moualem has set conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited to "through the legislation of the present Constitution", and warned against interference.
Trump will win another presidential term.
From that logic, Trump will probably be re-elected in 2020, unless the court case and scandals end his presidency before time, which many liberals hope for.
What is undoubtedly going to be “the most dramatic conclusion of a presidential term ever!”
There is no evidence of seretrift.
Since 2014, the number of seasons in the best broadcast time is almost doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best time to compare 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBCs The Rachel Maddow Show has the most viewers with up to 3.5 million on evenings with great news.
"It's a spectra that people are attracted to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, who leads the ABC drama Designated Survivor about a leader of the cabinet, who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author behind "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he wanted to vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" said Scovell.
The casino has entertainment value.
But unlike all other television programs, the stories coming from Washington can determine the case between Roe and Wade, if refugee families can reunite and the health of the world economy.
Changing the channel is only the most privileged.
And yet it’s about more than being enlightened citizens when you see six hours of panel debate, where experts discuss Bob Woodward’s use of “deep background,” when he wrote his book “Fear”; Paul Manafort’s stretch jacket to $15,000 (be dressed with hybris,” wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormmy Daniel’s live description of Trump’s antomy.
I will never see Super Mario in the same way.
"Some of what makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump show's rotating crew and daily surprises (slander with NF.L., praise to Kim Jongun-.)
But if you miss a section, you're off.
When I got to Fleiss this week, there were 26 degrees outside of his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and then MSNBC, while he took up CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, who would be heard in the Senate Judicial Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court would be determined.
“I can remember when we did all these crazy shows before, and people said, ‘It’s the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Floiss told me.
“I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Big sums find way to the close mid-term election to the House of Representatives
It’s not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th district receives large sums of money. As a result of a settlement of two “Congressional Districts”, two Congressional Districts members fight for the same seat.
This recently abandoned suburban district of Pittsburgh creates problems for Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb opposes another sitting member of Congress, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which overlaps strongly with the new 17th.
The shorts were made, after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January, convicted that the old district was unconstitutionally suspended in the Republicans' favor.
The struggle for the new 17th district has started a struggle for economic funds between the large parties’ committees, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in an election with high vigilance in March's special election for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The case has been on Republican hands for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give Democrats a small advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for support in China, but changed its
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners sued Trump’s leadership team.
Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call senior U.S. diplomats back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, foreign ministry spokeswoman in a statement earlier this month.
But it was only El Salvador, who was punished. They received about 140 million dollars of the United States in 2017 to b.narchotic control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts of financial assistance and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As internal meetings drew forward, North and Central American officials set out a top conference on security and economic development, it would have continued last year's meeting to be a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, top officials made it clear that they would have the conference to take place anyway, and thus dropped the considerations of punishment to El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has to speak to the conference scheduled for mid-October, to send a signal of the importance that Americans put in the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. sent in secret back to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new hard demands or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton of the White House did not want to comment on the details of the case, as described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who would like to talk about the internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration, who also spoke out from a condition of anonymity.
Know History
The next obstacle could very well be the special accuser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstruction of the investigation, which is considered and publicly available evidence for.
Mueller will also direct his investigation into the issue of whether Trump’s campaign secretly cooperated with Russia on the attack on the election.
If Congress were to come on new hands, Trump will probably be put in charge while he is preparing again to meet the voters and, at the time, of course, a jury of his traps.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not claim that Trump is finally inevitable — and the same applies to his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
In 1938, German officers were ready to enter with a coup against Hitler if only the West had been able to resist him by supporting the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and did not take the opportunity to avoid the year-long blood bath then.
It is about such turning points that the axis of history is concerned, and the infallible march of democracy to or withdraw.
In the U.S., there are now too many of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who decides the future of Mueller's investigation, Deputy Prime Minister Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been warm since this paper could inform him that last year he had proposed to make hidden recordings of the president and to challenge his suitability for office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' production is unpredictable.
"How do we react if F.B.I.'s recently sought investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is set or not carried out properly, or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And, what more important is, will we vote for a Congress which will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I think we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, who was deported to Auschwitz by the self-same Nazi regime, who once occupied my embassy's homeland.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to light Sabbath lights on the table with the garden choir.

Graham Dorans of Rangers is optimistic about the match against SK Rapid Wien
Rangers take on Thursday against SK Rapid Wien. After the impressive undefeated result in Spain against Villarreal earlier in the month, they will have a victory against the Austrians with great opportunities to move forward from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorans from getting a season debut before the 2-2 game against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use the result as a springboard for something even bigger.
"It was a good point for us, for Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We went to the fight with faith that we could get something home and we got a point.
Maybe we could've taken the stick home, but everything was a reasonable result.
They were probably best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday will be another major European evening.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they got a good result in last game. But with the audience behind us, I am sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
The last year has been hard because of all that has happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can run on now, put last season behind us and get success.”
Anxiety over pension savings makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the study participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to be used, only a few were talking to the family about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationswides study reported that they discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t do anything to initiate the conversation,” says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationswide Life Insurance Company.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and the children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t in good time tell them about your wishes.
Use your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices can be crucial factors for the cost.
Ask your financial advisor: Your counselor can also help you find out how to pay for your expenses.
Long-term care can be financed by means of a traditional long-term nursing insurance, life insurance with cash payments or self-insurance with your own funds, as long as you have an economy for it.
Get ordered legal documents: take the legal battles into circulation.
Get prepared a full power so you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure doctors and nurses comply with your wishes, in case you cannot communicate yourself.
Also consider an economic power.
In that case, you will appoint a trusted person who can make financial decisions and make sure your bills are paid if you do not even have the option.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that one of your aging parents needs emergency medical care and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Get all these details down to writing, so you're ready.
“It’s not just a matter of the economy, who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
"What medicine?
Who fits the dog?
Get the plan in place."
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a trip to the city.
The victim was in the 40s and was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, between the floor and the hand.
The officer describes the shooting, which took place at around 2:30 p.m., as "every coincidence."
The victim did not see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police call witnesses to stand up.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and a tsunami that on Friday hit the Indonesian city of Palu. It informs the authorities that the number of killed will rise.
Since the communication routes are out of play, emergency relief workers have not been able to receive information from the Donggala regent, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake struck.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Russian province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city celebrated 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regent that extends over 300 km of coastline on the northwest part of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basic pillars of the central-sulawesian economy, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel winding is also important in the province, but mainly takes place in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala, according to Indonesia’s disaster center, have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was again hit by a tsunami that killed nine.
Indonesia is seismological on the so-called Pacific Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A massive earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226.000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, including over half of those in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit Sumatra's west coast last March and only in April.
Several hundred people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake measuring 6.8 hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake measuring 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands out of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and spread destruction and panic as the population was reminded of 2004's deadly earthquake and tsunami.
A tsunami was not triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by the interconnected buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist-ø Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice-president Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin of Wasilla, Alaska was arrested after suspicion of domestic violence, the prevention of domestic violence, and to oppose arrest, according to the report issued by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is the trademark of the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a bail of $500 without security, KTUU reports.
He was arrested on Saturday when he declared himself "not guilty," the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A offenses, which can lead to a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B offense, which can lead to a penalty on a single day in prison and a fine of $20,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the assault.
The case is currently under treatment at Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, having prevented the review of a violent crime in the home, as well as a ceasefire in affected conditions in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of giving her a blow in her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran groups after explaining his son’s violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his deployment in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds died
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake on Friday struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and communication roads, and the number of dead is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit just south of the central Sulawesi, which is north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media, videos that show the moment when the earthquake strikes.
Several hundred people were gathered to a beach party in the city of Palu, when the tsunami struck the coast.
Public prosecutors are trying to get terror suspects in NYC condemned the death penalty
Public prosecutors are trying to get the death penalty of Sayyfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people, a rare punishment that was ultimately condemned to a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov reportedly used a rental car from the Home Depot construction market to perform an attack on a bicycle path along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who came in the way were emailed down.
As a basis for the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "predictably" killed the eight victims and "presumably" caused serious injuries. This is required by the death penalty declaration in New York's southern district.
According to the court document, the death penalty is a possible result of both of these long term events.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury could present Saipov for a charge of 22 points. Below there were eight charges of murder in connection with gangster business, typically used by public prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and an accusation of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "excellent planning and preparations," the prosecutors said, describing Saipov's execution as "unfortunate, malicious and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, medical corruption and loss for families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci," stands in the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since New York’s southern district finally raised the defendant in a case of the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but ended up getting life-long prison sentences in September 2009.
The death of a state case in New York City in 1953 was finally abolished and Ethel Rosenberg was executed after being convicted of espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg pair was executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov originated from Uzbekistan, and, according to the legal documents, no signs of remorse in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was doing well with his works.
According to the prosecutor, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by seeing ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to hang the ISIS team up at his hospital room, told the police.
He has refused to be guilty of the charges 22 points.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that they were "seriously disappointed" over the defendant's decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and lifelong prison force without the possibility of release will only extend the trauma to all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Conservative Minister believes, NIGEL FARAGE should take over Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the army" during a demonstration at the Conservative meeting today.
The former Ukip leader stated that politicians could "mark pressure" from the Euro-Politics, after one of Theresa May's own ministers had said Farage should take over negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said to the Birmingham demonstration that Britain would have "very out now", if Farage had been Brexit dealer.
May’s challenge in creating a collection in the deeply divided party is underlined by conservative remainers participating in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan on the track under attack by both Brexiters, remainers and the EU.
Her allies insist that, despite the backlash, she will continue to try to obtain an agreement with Brussels - thereby forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or "caos".
For the demonstration Leave Means Leave in Solihull, Bone announced that he would scrap Chequers plan.
He explained that he should have included Farage and given him responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have been out now," he said.
The Minister of Wellingborough added: "I'm going to fight for Brexit, but we're going to scrap Chequers."
On the basis of his EU claim, he said: “We didn’t fight World War II to be someone’s subordinate.
We will decide our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 vote: "That the British people would have changed their mind and would like to stay in the EU is completely wrong."
The conservative Brexiter Andrea Jenkys was also the demonstration and told the reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is unpopular in the broad population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the street and get us elected.
Drop now Chequers, and start listening.’
As a tipnote to May, she added: “Premier ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the trainee that politicians should be able to "mark the pressure" if they fail the vote in 2016.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
"They will betray Brexit, but we are gathered to tell them that we will not let them get away with."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “You must make sure that the political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, can feel pressure.
“We mobilize the population army here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we do not stop until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud UK.”
Imens marched remainers through Birmingham before a two-hour climb in the city centre.
Scattered activists fanted with Conservative Mod Brexit banners after the formation of the group this weekend.
Labour fellow Lord Adonis did before the meeting laughed at the security issues with the Conservative Party app.
"It is the people who claim they have control over the IT systems and technology of Canada, to border controls, to free trade without borders in Ireland," he said.
"It's all for laugh.
“There’s nothing called a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren "overwhelms heavily" to run for the presidential election
Member of the House of Representatives Senator Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly to run for the presidential election" after the November mid-term elections.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future during a council meeting on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticised Donald Trump, will try to gain reelection against State Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
I wonder if she would challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters at the City Hall, since Trump took office.
A participant asked her if she plans to run for the presidential election.
Warren replied that it’s time for women to take to Washington and repair our political system, and it requires a woman in front.”
Accumulation in the case of a gunshot robbery at LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana announced on Saturday that there was a suspected gunshot attack on Wayde Sims, basketball player from LSU.
Police in Baton Rouge announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested Friday to an ET news meeting at 11.
They had released a video of the shooting to ask for help to identify a man on the recordings.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was hit by gunshots in his head and died of injuries," police chief Murphy J. Paul said.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to having been present, possessing a weapon and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and is now in the police in the East Baton Rouge district's custody.
Sims was a two-meter-high third-year-old student who grew up in Baton Rouge. In the last season he played 32 games, started inside ten and played on average 17.4 minutes and scored 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the World Cup, after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a crucial role in the race.
From the lead position, Bottas got a good start and was close enough to slowly finish Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove in the pit as the first, allowing Hamilton to fight with the traffic in the rear of the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes car went to the pit a half time later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back in front of the Ferrari driver after some wheel contact reluctantly had to leave the inert after a double force at third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the rear row and was number seven after the first round of his 21st birthday.
Then he led in a large part of the race, when in an attempt at a quick finish he avoided changing tires to take Kimi Raikkonnen's fourth place.
He had to go to the pit in the 44th round, but could not increase the pace of the last eight innings, why the Raikkon secured the fourth place.
"It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did it amazing all weekend and really was a gentleman when he let me get past.
The team made an incredible piece of work to ensure us both the first and second places,” Hamilton said.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Diana Feinstein at a Saturday election meeting because she insisted that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sex assault.
At a ballot meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony given by Ford in front of the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee, but instead said that the events in the Senate showed that people were "nonprofit and disgusting and dishonest."
“The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last couple of days in the Senate, when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and cruel and dishonest,” he said.
"When you look at statements and doctors, they say, 'Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember that?
Diane Feinstein, was that you who covered it?
Remember her answer... Was it you who leaked the document - "Oh, uh, what?
No, no.
I haven't leaked anything."
Hey, just a moment.
If we've leaked... No, we haven't leaked anything," he added in an imitation of the senator.
Feinstein was sent to the letter about Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's accusations, and I haven't leaked her story," Feinstein told The Hill.
“She asked me to keep the letter confidential and I did.”
But her denial was not well received by the president, who during Saturday's election meeting said, "I tell you that it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but that’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
During the president's continued defense of the nominated judge to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, Trump proposed that the Democrats used the accusations to give their own case.
“They don’t fire money in their efforts to take power back.
You can see the cruelty, the modality they don’t care about, who they’re going to drum to get power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made it well again after Friday's lost Elite League match against Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants quickly came in front of two goals with attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were on their way home before Dwyer again brought Giants in front.
Francois Bouchard appointed Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the third Elite League team for Adam Keefe's team, which came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Friday's match in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides, where Giants went out as the victors of the three previous games.
Dwyer posted in the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assist from Kendall McFaul with David Rutherford as an assist, when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy first-time period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt was behind Cownies' equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Giants came in front of the first break when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard again settled with a nice goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen lead Dundee ahead for the first time in the game late in the second period, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four out of their five games, are at home in Milton Keynes for their next match on Friday.
Flight leader died to ensure that hundreds of flight passengers escaped earthquakes
An airliner in Indonesia was hailed as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers came safely down on Earth.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake on Friday hit the Sulawesi island and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still occupy the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung's colleagues fled for life, he refused to leave his place in the swayed control tower in Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He was back in his place to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was held on the starting track, was safe in the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was running together.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said according to Australian ABC News that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, who would bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're the son-in-law," he added.
The authorities fear that the death toll can reach several thousand, and the country’s disaster preparedness indicates that there is limited access to the villages of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death rate is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins, and it is not possible to get to them," spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, which holds a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly emergency aid and supplies in.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to Sky News: "Every minute a new ambulance comes with several bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
All shops are plundered.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’re going to do.
It’s already a tragedy, but it can be much worse.”
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask all of you to work 24 hours a day to perform all tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he said according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombrok earlier this year, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini says that a man is missing after the plane crash in the lagoon.
The airline behind the aircraft that crashed into the lagoon of the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says that a man is missing, although previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members were evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
According to a press release, Air Niugini said Saturday afternoon could not locate a male passenger.
The airline announced that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned to inquiries about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Locals both helped save the other passengers and crew, after the aircraft hit the water during landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline says six passengers were in the hospital until Saturday, and that they were all in stable condition.
It is still not clear what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both state that the aircraft landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane flew past the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very low water.
"It was really lucky," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers could go into water for life to get to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the crew went into panic and shouted, and he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors who worked to renovate a kayak nearby also helped in rescue work by using a rubber boat to freight people on land before the aircraft sank at about 30 meters deep.
Data from Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents with PNG registered airlines over the past two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analysts determine the timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The Prosecutor's Office ended its investigation on Saturday during the appeal for a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analysts in the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, filed testimony for several hours as an expert in data analysis.
He described the jury how he used teleinformation to play the course of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers that night she died, which was contrary to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger wrote.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' mobile phone at the time he had claimed that he, along with his friend Michael Sanford, visited Sanford.
Sanford sat in the witness's desk on Saturday and told him he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis spoke the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "looked because my truck was in Nashville."
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' SMS messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He deleted her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to win later that day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hip hop trio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol believes hiphop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They will return to the starting point and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently received a revitalization in the UK due to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
Children's in New York City are looking for couples after firing with "racist" sms
A nanny in New York's case seeks a couple of discriminatory firings after sending a text message by a parent who complained that she was "a black person."
The couple denied that they are racists, but compared the action with "presumation".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed his fear of finding out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEJ, NOT ENDNU A SHORT PERSON," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a sms.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, the "inconvenient" Plasco-Flaxman Giselle Maurice fired and said that their former nanny, who from African-Americans, had been ill for her work, and that she instead expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day work and sent home in a Uber.
Now Giselle Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the fire and compensation for $350 a day for the six months in which she would have stayed with her family, even though this was agreed without a contract.
"I would like to show them that you can't allow yourself to do that," she told the newspaper Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have defended themselves that they are not racists, and that the firing of Maurice was justified because they were afraid they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
“My wife had come to send her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
"We're not racist," said Joel Plasco to The Post.
“But would you leave your children to someone whom you had been unaware of, even if it had happened to a mistake?”
Your infant?
Totally honest."
Plasco compared the action with "precision", and that his wife had born two months before and was found in a "very difficult situation."
“Are you really looking for someone like that?
It is not very friendly," added the investment advisor.
Although the trial is still underway, the Court of Human Rights has already signed the couple on social media and defrauded their behavior and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared readers could not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was released, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine being the one who reads it for the first time before it was released.
It’s nice to read now when you know how popular Paddington was.”
She said that her father who worked as a cameraman on the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book on a small garment would have been optimistic, although his history was rejected, and that the 60th year of the publication of the books was "bitterborn" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father in all modesty was proud of her success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't say that he was a good man," she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it felt almost like you had a child who achieved something: You’re proud of them, even though it’s not really your profit.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he used to say that it was Paddington's fault."
Say goodbye to the dying daughter over the phone
After the landing, her daughter was driven to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Now called with regular spaces to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn't survive," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad that she would die within the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my treasure.
I'll see you soon.
See you later.
The medication she had gotten to keep her heart running slowly lost their effect.
She was dead shortly before, and now her body closed down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn’t cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to take me together.”
Finally, the grieving Ednan-Laperouse on board the plane along with the other passengers who did not know what she was going through.
"No one knew that," she said.
"I broke my head, and the tears were running.
It’s hard to explain, but on the plane I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Safe women try to stop suicide jumpers
Two women who have lost relatives to suicide attempt to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers to help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he got a depression and 18, when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to experience the grief I’m through every day,” she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with an infected smile.
“His smile was known by everyone.
People said his smile was shining the room up.”
He stopped working until he died because he was really bad.
In 2014, it was Tyler’s 11-year-old brother who found him when he had taken his life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid if it spreads."
Sharon Davis made the cards to "teach people that there is someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don’t go with your thoughts yourself, you have to talk to someone.”
Sharon Davis' long-time friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost his girlfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about it or depressed or anything," she said.
“Some days before Christmas, he began to change.
He was really far down on Christmas day. When the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them.”
She said that his death was very traumatic to them, but that they have to get through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
It has torn us apart.
We all have to continue and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still unexplained, while the FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for — a limited scope time-limited study — maybe we could get a little consensus,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the comet was "falling from the other" in the middle of the locked party-parted situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not have the FBI conducted their investigation?
Their restraint is due to timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans, as expected, fail badly, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to choose for the country's highest judge.
George W. Bush has called for senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through there met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has completed its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known whether Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the decisive vote and choose him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors 'falls' during Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from South Korea’s Department of Conduct and said there were 1.127 defectors last year compared to 2.706 in 2011.
Park stated that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human traffickers were instrumental in changing numbers.
Pyongyang has not given any official comments.
Most of North Korea’s outlets are offered citizenship in South Korea.
The South Korean government said that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border facing North Korea, and is easier to cross than the highly guarded demilitarised zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the defectors as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, so they are often forced homeowners.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is technically still at war, has been significantly improved over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the stranded negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This is done after the historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work against a nuclear-free Korea on an overall plan.
North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong-ho gave U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no belief in our national security, and in such circumstances it is excluded that we will defeat on our own,” said Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric" and says he is unfit for the Supreme Court
President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for Supreme Court judgments, for "hysteric" and said his temperament was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosis's comment came in an interview Saturday to the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t think that if a woman had behaved in the way a woman would have called her hysterical,” said Pelosi on his reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh rejected the accusations that he had committed a sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he talked about his family and his years in highschool, he almost cried and was crying.
He also condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him "groke and a coordinated character maturity" arranged by the left wing, angering Hillary Clinton not to win the presidential post in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not sit in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was preoccupied with the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with the opinions and the way he went after the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi's way beyond when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to a rigged if he is confirmed and if the Democrats receive majority in the House of Representatives.
"I want to say that if he doesn't speak true to Congress or the FBI, he's not suitable to sit in the Supreme Court, but rather in the court he's sitting in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington D.C. Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was worried about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions in connection with Obama’s health reform or the abortion case Roe v. Wade because he is considered to be a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions as to whether he would make certain previous Supreme Court decisions.
“It must not be done that a hysterical, presumed person should contest a job as a judge and expect us to say ‘yes, it’s not just great,’ said Pelosi.
And women need to use it.
It’s a fair outcome, several months and years of anger that chamber over, and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal, do you think?"
She continued: "I received great support from a woman who was the boss who said she also cried when she was angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she was angry and started crying, she would say to the one she spoke to: "You may think I'm sorry because I cry.
But I'm angry."
And then she just got to know.
And I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are essentially misunderstood.
One of my most obvious memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with an excess of men, where I often cried out of anger, where I was taken by the neck of an older woman — a cold boss, whom I had always been a little scared of — and pulled out on the stairs.
"You must never let them see that you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They will believe you're sorry, and they'll accept that they got a ram on you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was a member of Congress for the Democrats from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to have an affair on a boat named Monkey Business and retired as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and came to the conclusion that she could as well run for president.
“There was no particularly thoughtful decision,” she laughed at me 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and they didn’t need another candidate.
Some called it “Snehvide and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind fundraising, so she promised she would not participate unless she collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
“Do you think I’m getting a discount?” she thought.
When she held a speech that she would not stand up, she was overwhelmed by feelings — thankful for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so much travel money and reach out to voters rather than voters, and anger over sexism — that she got a lump in her throat.
"You could think that I got a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls how the press responded to her.
“I thought I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking what to write on my gravestone?
“She cried?”
How the trade war between the United States and China can be an advantage for Beijing
The opening halls of the trade war between the United States and China were loud, and although the battle is far from over, tension between countries can be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by putting tariffs on important Chinese export products, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation this week with new customs duties affecting goods for a value of $200 billion is in principle half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has made a return every time, most recently by putting customs duties at 5-10% on US goods for $60 billion.
China has sworn to follow the U.S. all the way, and the world's second largest economy probably does not give up after just a while.
If it makes Washington withdraw their demands, it means that they leave, but for China's President Xi Jinping it will be too embarrassing to bend for the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the U.S. pressure in the trade war can have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
“A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can create a federation for an economy that can get out of control in both countries, and it’s actually much more dangerous than you thought,” said Abigail Grace, research staff focusing on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' to receive refugees, says Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says the country is ready for refugees to return, asking for help to build the country that has been destroyed by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country were in recovery.
"Today, the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government has continued to control the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore a normal state.
All conditions are now in place for refugees to return to the country they had to leave because of terrorists and unilateral economic sanctions that hit their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since 2011, when the war began.
More than six million people still in the country need emergency assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would like to accept help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that helped support the rebellion.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup 2018 and defeated the American team 16.5 - 10.5 in the Le Golf National outside of Paris.
The U.S. has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy back when Captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points it required to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had it very hard in most of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake on par 3 on the 16th hole, causing him to lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari finished well in all rounds and became 1 out of a total of 4 players who have received 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament's current format started.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 of the lowest ranking European player, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
No. 1 on the World Rankings, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in the baggage, Spainrd Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's most winning europe with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t do it.
It's been a hard year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really happy to get the trophy back.
“It’s a team effort, and I’m glad I could help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He sends the bench on to his countryman John Ram, who fell off the American golfing Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single match on Sunday.
“I am incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It’s a big statistic for one of the best golfers ever to win 14 major titles, just surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had the weekend trouble finding the form with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing show: "I'm proud of the boys, because they fought for the case.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe a counterplay.
We lost.
Hat of Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We will regroup, and I will cooperate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will proceed.
I love the 12 guys, and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to ease your hat.
We were defeated."
Update on algeop flowering: Concentrations are reduced in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that there is a general decreasing alge concentration in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, spread blooms in the area of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier are reported to be declining.
The rise of algae spread over a coastline of 210 km from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
There are less blooms about 16 km from the coast of Hillsborough County, but there are fewer than last week.
It has also been observed in Pasco County.
There have been reports of medium-sized concentrations in or at sea in Pinellas County during the last week, low to high concentrations in the sea outside Hillsborough County, background concentration to high concentrations in Manatee County, background concentration to high concentrations in or in the sea out of Sarasota County, background concentration to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, background concentration to high concentrations in or in the sea outside Lee County and low concentrations in Collier County.
There are still reports of breathing difficulties in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There have been no reports of respiratory distress in Northwestern Florida in the past week.
