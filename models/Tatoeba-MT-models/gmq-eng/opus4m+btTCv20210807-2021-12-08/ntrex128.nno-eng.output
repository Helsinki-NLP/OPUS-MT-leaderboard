Walisian members of the National Assembly are afraid of not being taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly recently became dismayed by a proposal to change names from assesmbly members or AM (communication member) to a member of the Welsh Parliament or MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reaction came because of plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
Members of several political parties are concerned that they may be laughtered.
A member of Labour said his group is concerned about your "MWP rhymes on Twp and Pwp"
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means foolish and "pwp" chant.
A member of the Plaid party said that the group "is not satisfied" and has proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative member said his group has a "open mind" in terms of the name change, but added that MWP is not far from the word "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is not pronounced unlike the English Yorkshire dialect's pronunciation of the letter u.
The National Assembly's delegation, now writing bill to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on which members of the National Assembly will be named will of course be up to the members themselves."
A 2017 Welsh official decision gave the National Assembly power to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the naming proposals that demonstrated great support for calling the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the title of the National Assembly members, the delegation prefers Welsh Member of Parliament or WMP, while the MWP election received the most support during the public hearing.
The National Assembly members have reportedly made other proposals, but the struggle to become single has given the leader of the delegation, Elin Jones, main work. She will deliver the bill in a couple of weeks.
The legislation of reforms contains other changes to how the delegation should function also, including rules on disqualification of assembly members and the design of a committee system.
Assembly members will be able to vote on what to name when debating the bill.
Macedonians run in referendum to change the name of the country
The selectors will be on Sunday's runover if they are to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The referendum was decided to solve a conflict that has preceded many decades of neighbouring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a requirement for the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia's membership applications to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said that he is going to see away from the result.
Those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the naming change is simply the price to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin stylize while the churches of Harlem, New York, struggling
"The old I've talked to said that in old days it was a bar and a church on each corner," Adams said.
"Today none of the parts are found."
He said he understands why the bars disappear.
"People socialize in other ways now to day," he said.
"Children are no longer stylists in the neighborhood that people visit to normal."
In the case of the cows, he is concerned that the money from selling the property does not come to last as long as the leaders believe, "and before or since they are back where they started."
He added that churches can be replaced by proportional apartments filled with the kind of people who don't care to help the historical sites of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy share apartments in these buildings are white," he said. "and so comes the day when all the churches are closed, because it is not likely that these people who move into the proportional apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white socks before Harlem became a black borough - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin church a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black sock that had been nearby, moved into the building.
Sankt Martin was taken over by a black sock hired by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also hired the boycott of the stores in 125th street, a main shopping street in Harlem where owners opposed to adding or promoting blacks.
The building suffered major damage to a fire in 1939, but when Reverend Johnson's followers planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a new clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, the son of Johnson senior and successor of Saint Martin, was proud and called the clock game "the clocks of the poor."
The expert who played at the clock game in July called it something else: "One cultural treasure" and "a historical instrument that cannot be replaced."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the first clock game in the world to be played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who leaves the church to play at the larger clock game in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said Sankt Martin could not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in Saint Martin over the past few months has become a complicated story of architects and building workers, any of them added by the leaders of the church, and others of the Episcopal Diocese.
The sacristy, who hires the parish and consists of the leaders of the layfolk, wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "would ask the sacristy to pay," although the sacristy was not involved in the diocese's addition of architects and building workers.
Some of the members of the parish have complained of the lack of openness from the diocese.
13-year-old damaged by shark during humming-dykk in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday while diving after humming in California on the opening day of the humming season.
The attack took her right before 7 p.m. in the morning near the Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented to KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy yelling for help. He paddled away to the boy with a group and pulled him out of the water.
Hammel said that first he believed only the boy was thrilled to have caught a hummer, before realizing that the boy yelled, "whatever you do?
Something will drive me!"
"His heel collar bone was torn off," Hammel said he observed when he reached the boy.
"I scream that everyone had to get out of the water: It's a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was taken from air ambulance and taken to Rady hospital for children in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
It is uncertain what kind of shark it was like undoing the boy.
Badguard Captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but that shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles added that the boy suffered serious injuries to the upper body.
Authorities closed access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that more than 135 different species of shark exist in the area, but most are not believed to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's stakes on beauty products
The British store chain Sainsbury's is to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenham's beauty products and offer large magazine services in the store.
As part of an investment in the UK's gender market, worth £2.8 billion and continue to grow while fashion and interiorsala go down, Sainsbury's should test out their gender products for 11 stores next year, and more stores if successful.
The investment in beauty products comes at a time where the shelves that pled to be filled with TVs, microwaves, and interiors are now empty.
Sainbury's said they should double the number of beauty products to 3,000 products and offer the brand Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
They should label L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand as in Boots stores.
The store should also relaunch its own makeup series Boutique and make most of the products vegan, which should attract more young customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop should test the sale of their perfumes in two of Sainsbury's stores. The first opened in Croydon, London, last week, and the second should open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Action online and a shift towards buying small amounts of food every day from local small stores means large store chains need to find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, managing leader of Sainsbury's, has commented that the stores will look more and more like supermarkets, while the shop chains are trying to fight low-price stores Aldi and Lidl with several services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's have joined the interior chain of Argos for hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat stores, since they bought up both chains two years ago. Sainsbury's claims this has increased the grocery store and such defended the acquisition.
The store chain's previous attempt to renew the beauty and pharmacy departments was not a success.
Sainsbury's collaboration with Boots in the early 21st century, but this ended when parties did not agree on how to share the profits from pharmacies in stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy chain Celesio, which had 281 pharmacies and owned the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still has a role to play and should offer an extended luxury series of skin products, including labeled La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: "We have changed how the beauty shelves will look and experience to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also added colleagues with special skills to offer beauty services.
Our trademarks are designed so that they fit all needs, while the appealing environment and practical placements mean that we are now an attractive beauty destination challenging the old way to act."
Peter Jones "racing" after Holly Willoghby withdraws from deal worth £11 million
The star from the television program Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is "racing" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an agreement with his lifestyle brand worth £111 million to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time to promote their interior and worship brand Truly.
The couple's collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host of the This Morning program, 37, made the news known on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the star from Dragons Den, Peter Jones, in the midst of the development of their new collaboration on a lifestyle brand to focus on their own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was "racing" when the Golden Holly confessed during an strained meeting on Tuesday in Jones' headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly's new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - means she no longer has time to collaborate on the interior and worship brand Truly.
The collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to make known that she should not work with Truly, while Jones escaped the United Kingdom to settle in one of her holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was certainly at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term plan for the future, and would last for many decades.
Her decision to withdraw has surprised everyone involved.
No one believed his own islands on Tuesday, Truly was so close to the launch.
It stands a warehouse in Marlow filled with goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the decision of This Morning host, which is one of the richest stars in the UK, can cost the company millions due to fierce investments in products, from pillows to candlesticks to clothing and interiors, and can cause delays with launch.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, has been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created the brand Truly along with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
Para holiday together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby is to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin hosting ITV's I'm A Celebrity program.
A source near Jones said last night "We don't comment on his business."
Tough conversations "and so we fell in love"
He nonsense about the criticism he came to get from the media to make a comment some might experience as "superbian" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why does President Trump have given up so much?
Sa Trump with his nonsense voice as "new-reader".
"I haven't given up anything."
He commented that Kim is interested in a new meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step towards the disarmament of the North Korea nuclear weapons program.
But negotiations on the nuclear weapons program have halted.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not received a "equivalent response" from the United States facing North Korea's early defeat.
Instead, he added, continue the United States with sanctions to push North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"It's going great between us and North Korea," he said.
"We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He added that his work to improve relations with Kim has the breaking positive results - the end of rocket testing, aiding the release of hostages and the return of the leases to U.S. soldiers.
He defended his unusual procedure in terms of relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in, we had around 200 people standing right there," Trump said and pointed to the group standing before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy island and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign aid organizations were told that there was no need for them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok residents had to flee, no one declared national emergency state, which is necessary to obtain international emergency assistance.
"Dersverre they have been very clear in many cases that they do not want international help, so it's a bit challenging," Sumbung said.
As Redd Barna assembles a team to travel to Palu, it is still not certain if added with foreign passports are allowed to work in the field.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the Agency for National Crisis in Indonesia, said authorities are considering the situation in Palu to see if international organizations are allowed to offer emergency assistance.
Although Indonesia is prone to earthquakes often, the country is not specifically prepared for the natural forces.
In the Aceh area, they have built shelters for tsunamis, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
Despite warnings against tsunamis in Palu, there was no alarm, most likely leading to more victims.
Traveling between the Indonesian islands is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship located in Lombok to treat those who were injured in the earthquake is now heading to Palu, but it will spend at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on the better of the infrastructure in Indonesia during the presidential election, spending a lot of money on new roads and railways.
However, lack of funding has made it difficult for President Joko's administration, and next year there is elections again.
President Joko is also pushed in terms of sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have welcomed his conservative beliefs.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee as Christians and Muslim gangs fought in the streets and used macheter, arrow and bow, and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge saves Liverpool vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturdge won the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal while the position was 1-0.
He pushed the ball to the left before kicking him up and towards the goal.
The attempt sealed high over the penalty field and favored the right upper corner of the goal.
Finally, the ball fell over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and into goal.
"I just tried to get into that position to take the ball, and I knew players like Shaq are trying to get as far ahead as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kane come and tap the ball once without thinking about it, and then I shot the ball."
Chelsea rented 1-0 after the break after the scoring in the 25th minute of Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Prior to the goal, Hazard gave the ball to Mateo Kovacic before he bowled off the city near the midfield into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly took the ball on the midfield.
Then he cut it in a pleasant way and hired Hazard into the penalty field.
Hazard ran faster than Liverpool's defense and scora with left foot just past the keeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool are scheduled to play against Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at 15 on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo, Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15 on Thursday in London.

Parliamentary statue of Cromwell becomes the last victim of "rewriting history"
The removal of the statue would be karma for Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious artifacts in England that his Puritan followers did during the 17th century civil war.
But the Cromwell League described Crick's proposal for the removal of the statue as " Noise" and "a attempt to write about history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues, that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be a goal.
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was corrugated or performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been upset for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, for centuries before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent representation of Cromwell is evidence of public opinions in the 19th century, and is part of the historiography of a figure that many still seem worth celebrating."
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was in the 19th century, and is still today, regarded as a defender of parliament against external pressure, and in his case, of course, it was against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or one, is still a discussion theme in historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual whom we know represented one side of that distinction.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering."
Mordargris attack and kill Chinese pawns
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, named Yuan, was found dead, with cut arteries and covered with blood, near a pigbee on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to give pigs vaccines on a farm on 30 May, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently travelled with his cousin from neighboring province Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, he found his cousin dead, discovering that the gate of one of the pigs was open.
He said that in the bin there was a large hamlet with blood around his mouth.
The autopsy showed that a 250 kilo heavy pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"The legs of my cousin were bloody and destroyed," said the cousin, named Wu, to Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance cameras show that Yuan arrived in the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal who killed him did not listen to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to prevent him from attacking others, while police collected evidence of the scene.
Yuan's family now negotiates compensation with the leader of the market.
Although rare, such measures from pigs have occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, causing the man serious injury.
Ten years earlier a 295 kilo of heavy pig held a Welsh farmer caught between himself and a tractor, until his wife scare the pig away.
After a farmer in Oregon became eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to CBC News reported that pigs are not aggressive to common, but that the taste of blood can traverse the animals.
"They just want to play.
They like to bite a bit, they're curious... they won't hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them," he said.
Restar of Hurricane Rosa Brisbane Rain to Southwest United States
As predicted in the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weaker than the cool water along the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will carry a porridge to the north-Mexico and southwest U.S. for the next few days.
Rosa had wind strength up to 136 km/h and was a hurricane of category 1 up to 05:00 in the Eastern Time Zone of the United States on Sunday, and the hurricane center was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa has to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it forms a low pressure over the Pacific Ocean moving east to the west coast of the United States. Rosa comes near the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical humidity north to the southwest US.
Rosa will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will react with low pressure and cause thick rain in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 centimeters of rain can create dangerous whistles and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will lead to rain of between 5 and 7 centimeters an hour for some parts of the southwest United States, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of the southwest United States; especially over much of Arizona.
Dangerous whistles can occur due to scattered terrain and tropical rain.
It was warned against trips in the desert on foot due to the danger of tropical rain.
The rain can turn up to embarrassing rivers and lightning and thunderstorms will bring strong winds and dust.
The coming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the south-California coast.
Total rainfall amounts of over 1 centimetres are possible, which can create small flutes and smooth roads.
This will be the first rainforest for the season in the region.
Scattered tropical rain showers will start in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before rain increases late on Monday and Tuesday.
Four Corners region can wait a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October can witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic becomes colder, but tropical beaches will still be quite hot.
Sometimes this causes dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
There are almost 20 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, late summer heat will try to build up and spread again.
Much of central and austress the United States is expected to experience a warm start on October, with 25 degrees and upward from southern part of the major plains to parts of the northeast US.
New York City can reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
The long-term warning indicates that there are high chances of above average temperatures in the east US through the first half of October.
More than 20 million views on Brett Kavanaugh elevation
On Thursday, more than 20 million people looked at the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court and the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, of six different TV channels.
At the same time, the political discussion around the case continued, with interruption in the regular television programs of various broadcasting companies to reveal the latest news on Friday: a unity reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that the FBI over the next week should investigate the charges.
Ford told the Supreme Court Committee that she is 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was following her when he was drunk and trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, during a sensitive elevation, that he is 100 percent sure it didn't.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw the height of Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company arrived at this number by finding the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC.
The numbers were not clear from other channels showing the height, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has trouble counting viewers looking at from the office.
To put this into perspective, there is a similar number of viewers looking at an American football final or Oscar division.
Fox News' hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the channel was also the one with most viewers during the day with 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
ABC was second-placed 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
People are still interested in hearing.
Flake was focused on the drama on Friday.
After Flake, a moderate Republican, declared that he is on Kavanaugh's side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while protesters shouted for him on his way to a hearing with a judge committee on Friday.
He stood and watched the ground for several minutes while the protesters yelled at him on CNN live.
"I'm standing here right before you," said a woman.
"Are you sure he tells the truth of our country?"
Some said to him, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office has stated, and before entering the elevator he said he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
Broadcasting agencies showed the hearing on television when the judge committee was to be voiced or against the nomination of Kavanaugh to the full Senate and further violence.
But Flake said he could only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against Kavanaugh during the next week, which the Democrats have also requested.
Flake was partly abandoned after talking to his friend, Democrat, and Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake took a decision.
Flake's decision turned out to have power, because it became clear that the Republicans could not run for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May blames critics for "playing politics" in terms of Brexit
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, blames the critics of her plans to leave the EU to "play politics" with the future of Britain without regard to national interests, in an interview with the newspaper The Sunday Times.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to attend the Conservative Party's conference on September 29, 2018.
Alongside the interview with May on the front page of the Sunday Times, an interview with former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, stating that he is going to take action on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and says that the proposal for the UK and the EU to collect each other's charges is "heally absurd."
Wayde Sims shooting in the United States: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for Sims shooting
Police have arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), was killed.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for intentional murder, police say in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
An official video shows the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the kind of goal.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to a report from the WAFB channel, which is related to CBS.
After his resignation with Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
Simpson's bail was set at $350,000, the local newspaper The Advocate reports.
The Coroner of east-Baton Rouge made an early autopsy report on Friday showing that the cause of death was a shot in the head entering the neck.
Police in Baton Rouge thank state police in Louisiana's special forces, the state police's crimlab, the police at Southern University, and local residents to help them find Simpson.
The athletic director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the local police to be "the year-old in achieving justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 metre high basketball player wakes up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 backstrokes per game the previous season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "truckless" after Wayde was killed.
"This is something we're always afraid of," Wade said.
Vulkan asks for ash over Mexico City
ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Crisis Prevention calls for Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after activity increased in the crater and center recorded 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center had observed several spacers and tremors.
Images on social media show thin layers of ash on cars in various neighborhoods of Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since an earthquake with magnitude of 7.1 struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as "Don Goyo" and has been active since 1994.
Police noise along with Catalan separatists within the anniversary of the violence of independence
Six protesters were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters for self-defence noise along with police forces, and thousands of other protesters protested against independence one year after the run-up for any separation from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces while throwing eggs and powder varnish that created dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
The compound also broke out later in the day, and police used batons to prevent escalating.
For several hours the separatists shouted "Don't forget, don't forgive" while the protesters against independence shouted, "Lenge live Spain."
Local news channels reported fourteen people were treated for small-scale injuries after the protests.
The vote is still pressured in the region and many will still have self-defence one year after the October 1 launch, which was called illegal by Madrid, but which was celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
Most voters voiced for independence, but there were also low voter participation among those opposed to independence and boycott violence.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to prevent the violence and selective clashes occurred in the region.
Groups who were too self-driving slept in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
However, the demonstration went off the stack, but it was forced to take another route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protests along with his wife, said that he no longer has hope of independence in Catalonia.
"Last year, we experienced one of our best augine remains.
I saw my parents crying for joy in being able to voice for self-defence, but now we sit again," he said.
Although they won the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties who are too self-governing to hold power this year, while many of their leaders are in exile or arrest while waiting for the trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent self-determination statement.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protests in support of police on his phone, said the conflict was heads up by police officers on both sides.
"The tension increases more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been part of ongoing trials since last year, declared him to run for elections in the European Parliament next year.
"To run as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the backwardness of democratic values and oppression we have experienced from the Spanish state," he said.

Menga shot gives Livingston 1-0 win over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensures
Named Livingston surprises Rangers and Steven Gerrard experience his second win after 18 games coaching for the Ibrox club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to make the difference while Gary Holt's side smoothed with Hibernian in others.
Gerrard's side has no aways in the Scottish Premiership league this season, and is to play against Hearts, which they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers should host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston has six wins in a row, and head coach Holt has still not lost since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against the away team
Holt's team would have rented long before they scora, creating several problems for Rangers with their direct playing.
Scott Robinson broke through, but had low efforts towards goals, which allowed Alan Lithgow to work hard after the meeting with Craig Halkett's heading over the goal.
The home team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, well aware that they could create trouble for the away team.
And that was how the determined goal became scora.
Rangers agreed to a free kick and Livingston made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson headed Menga, taking a touch and scoring from the middle of the penalty field.
Before then, the Rangers dominated the ball, but saw that the home defense was solid and keeper Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continues into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save a goal.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but was stopped by Rangers' keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow barely faded after the ball was returned from Livingston.
Pasings were sent back and forth in the Livingston penalty field, while two penalties - after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one by hand - became winged away.
'Fenomenal' from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont in Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal struggle and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Each player played amazingly and still impresses on the curve upwards.
Their playing and playing style has barely changed since they returned to the top class, but much of the thanks for it goes to Holt for the way he has shocked the team since becoming a coach.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense, organizing a defense at military level, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worall throughout the game.
The Rangers were unlike not motivated.
Yet as good as they have been under Gerrard, however, they were not good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, and just cut up the home half once, which should make the Rangers realize that they don't reach up anymore.
Erdogan gets mixed welcome in Cologne
The state leaders of Turkey and Germany smiled under blue sky when they met to eat breakfast on Saturday, September 29 in Berlin.
It is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - as it is hoped to repair the relationships between the two NATO countries.
The countries have been inseparable in terms of human rights, press freedom and Turkey's role in the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a large, new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of over 25,000 in rallying in front of the mosque due to "security reasons," but many of Erdogan's supporters faced up to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan - many of the Kurdish - also faced up to condemn Erdogan's policies and the German state's decision to wish him welcome in the country.
The duel Protestants reflected the distinction between German Turks, who look at Erdogan as a hero, and others, who look at him as an autocratic.

Long Lartin Prison in England: Six Watches Insurrection
Six prison guards have been injured in a riot in a high-security prison for men, the prison office of England says.
Ongoing disorder broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 local time on Sunday.
Special "Torrnado" forces are ingested to calm down the rebellion, involving eight prisoners in a separate part of the prison.
The guards have been treated for small inlets.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained guards should calm down the ongoing uprising in HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our jails, and we are ready that those responsible will be reported to the police and may have to sit in jail longer."
It's more than 500 people in HMP Long Lartin, including any of the most dangerous criminals in the United Kingdom.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was being treated for injuries, after a prisoner went to jail.
And in October last year special forces had to come to the prison to calm down a serious riot, where prisoners cast billiards on the guards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with embarrassment (for dry areas)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but it is just such a weather phenomenon that is heading towards Arizona early next week, in the remnants of Hurricane Rosa pulling southwest over the desert and creating fear of embarrassment.
The national weather service has expired with warnings against embarrassment on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and south and east-Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, and can provide rain already late Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only "ti tropical cyclones have had tropical storm or low pressure status within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that reached 60 kilometers within the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center report between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
It can count between 2 and 5 centimeters in other areas of the south-west desert, including central parts of Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, with isolated total amounts up to 10 centimeters.
For areas outside of embarrassing risk, the rain from Rosa can be a blessing in the dried.
Although embarrassment is a serious concern, this likely rained useful areas in the southwest US prone to drought.
According to drought monitors in the United States, there is extreme drought in over 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second highest drought category, reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa arrives to move across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
With winds of over 135 kilometers per hour, Rosa is on Sunday morning 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore calms down.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storm force, Monday afternoon or evening.
It is going to count much in parts of Mexico, which can increase the risk of embarrassment.
"Regn between 7 and 15 centimeters is expected from Baja California to northwest Ziona, with the possibility of up to 25 centimeters," reported weather.com.
Rosa will pull north along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will pull further up through Arizona and into south-Utah Tuesday evening.
"The biggest danger with Rosa or the remains of this, is much rain in Baja California, northwest Ziona, and the U.S. Southwest Desert," said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to create life threatening whistles in desert areas and landslides in mountainous areas.
Attacks in Midsomer Norton, England: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested, suspected of murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset, England.
The teen boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 04:00 on Saturday.

Trump says Kavanaugh "lid" under where "simple and angry" Democrats were against him
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a run against the merciless and unreasonable tactics of the Democrats," Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "lid" under how "simple and angry" the Democrats were through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave testimony in front of Congress on Thursday, denying emotionally the charge of Christine Blasey Ford that he assaulted her sexually decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave testimony to her charges during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people got to see how brilliant and brave" Kavanaugh was that day.
"A voice to Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to one of the most proficient lawyers of our time, a lawyer with flawless service in the public," he said to an amount of followers in West Virginia.
The president also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about the importance of it for Republicans to run in the middle elections in the United States.
"Five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't run, but I'm really running," he said.
"That's why I travel around to fight for good candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are looking to "understand and block."
The first important run in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to happen last Friday, a Republican representative told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, numbers of killed increase
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them taken off huge waves on beaches, while a powerful earthquake and a tsunami framed the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, reported authorities on Sunday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to take part in a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when the waves, which were six meters high, struck the beach at sunset, taking many people while destroying everything they came across.
The tsunami came after an earthquake with magnitude of 7.5.
"The warning of the tsunami came yesterday, there were still people on the beach who did not leave immediately and so became the victims," stated Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for the emergency relief agency in Indonesia GDPB, in Jakarta.
"As if not the tsunami was enough in itself, he went with himself cars, wooden masts, houses; he framed everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled over open sea for a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climbed up into three to avoid the tsunami and survived that way.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photo from the air published by the emergency agency shows many broken buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continue to hit the coastal town on Saturday.
The Earthquake could be sold in the area around, which has a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Agency for testing and testing technology (BPPT) stated that the energy from the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the energy of the atomic bomb over Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho severely damaged as "wide" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls, and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the dead have been found during the remains of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and that 29 are still missing.
Nugroho said that the number of casualties and the size of destructions may be larger along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the quake.
"We have not heard anything from Donggala, communication has been cut" said Nugroho.
"More than 300,000 people live there," stated the Red Cross, adding that their added and volunteers are heading to the raw areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse," Red Cross said.
The crisis agency became on Saturday criticised for not informing that a tsunami had slowed Palu, although authorities said waves came within the time period notifying.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man at the top floor of a building shouting desperate to humans down the streets to warn them against the coming wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hits the coast, bringing buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the video with the first one.
The quake and tsunami caused power breaks and cut the communication around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate the nautilus.
The military has started the process of submitting cargo aircraft with nautilus from Jakarta and other cities, reports authorities, but the refugees still need food and have other basic needs.
The air port of the city was reopened to receive nautilus, but will continue to be closed until October.
It was planned that President Joko Widodo would visit the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of casualties in Indonesia exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
They added in the World Vision from Donggala has come safely up to Palu City, and have set up tents in the back yard of their office. On the way to the city, the total covered areas, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many broken houses," he said.
It's very bad.
As the naud relief organizations start work to help those who were hit by the tsunami, some have complained that foreign naud relief workers with expertise in crisis handling have been denied entry to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign aid organizations and their added start work before Indonesia has declared that the area is a national crisis zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is a crisis at provincial level," said Alia Arriani, a Red Cross spokesman in Indonesia.
"When the state says "OK, this is a national crisis," we can open for international nautilus, but they have not updated the status yet."
It's evening again in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, and friends and family of those still missing are still hoping for a miracle, but know that such natural disasters don't end well.
On Saturday, a small boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was rescued from the remains of a collapsed building, where she had doctors caught next to her dead mother for two days.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglids from the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
A man called Mandagi said that any of those trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As one with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to pray," he said.
Gendon told me that he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the paraglidians from Palu, who had taken part in the local beach festival, after hearing that Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages showed only a gray chin, rather than two blue chins.
"I think that means the messages did not appear," he said.
Twenty-seven stel $226 750 from ATM in Newport, Levee, United States
On Friday, thieves stolen $26 750 from a worker in the company Brink's in what he was filling up a ATM in Newport, Levee, USA, according to a press release from the police in Newport.
The worker had just run a minibank in the entertainment area and was delivering more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy stated in the press release.
As the worker was busy, "spy a man up behind the worker" and stole a sack of money to be delivered.
Witnesses observed several suspects while escaping from the scene, according to the press release, but police could not determine the number of people involved in the robbery.
If someone has information about who was involved, they should call the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapparen renames Ye
Rappar Kanye West changes its name - to Ye.
He declared the change of name on Twitter on Saturday, writing: "The Creation formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had Ye as nickname for a while, using the name as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The name change came right before he would perform on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show after she cancelled due to "emotional causes," the program host said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artist name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think the word "yes" is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," West said earlier this year when he discussed the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
The name has changed from Kanye, meaning the only one, to just Ye - to reflect the good we do, the bad we do, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects on who we are."
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West before, has also changed the style of writing of the name with and without hyphenation and uppercase letters.
Future President of Mexico promises not to send the military against civilians
The future President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to send military forces against civilians. The country will soon mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody treatment of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "never should use the military to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the military injured peaceful protesters and killed about 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support for students and open more free universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of access to education have prompted youth to join criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double investment in artificial intelligence
Since China is working more actively with artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investments in research on the subject, the investor and user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the U.S. government stated about artificial intelligence, although the United States lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year, aiming to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A doubling of the budget for research on artificial intelligence would be a good start, since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
A doubling in funding can double the chances of the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence taking place in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month via the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the managing director (CEO) of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the largest companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with a system of artificial intelligence that struck the highest ranking player of the game Othello, and later worked as a leader in Microsoft Research and was chairman of Google in China.
Lee recognized former technology competitions organized by the U.S. state, such as "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge" and asked how time the next competition should be, so that he will be involved and identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get support from the state, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's the big companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired excellent students from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen research on artificial intelligence.
"I think doctoral students within artificial intelligence should be automatically detained," he said.
The China State Council published its plan for the next generation's artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Federation of Natural Sciences funds students at academic institutions, not unlike the U.S. National Science Association and other state organizations' way of distributing money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a common center of artificial intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from the industry and academia, and the White House declared the formation of a committee of artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI (artig intelligence) Next.
The National Science Association invests more than $100 million a year in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, no one has worked on the bill on national security and artificial intelligence for months.
Macedonians run in referendum to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voiced on Sunday in a referendum if they should change the name of the Republic of North Macedonia to resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from joining the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, insists that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a requirement for their territory, and has used veto to vote against membership of Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change can undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he should not be voiced in the referendum, and a boycott has sown doubts as to how far the popular violence will reach the least 50 percent of the population she needs to be valid.
The question of the referendum statement is: "Are you for NATO and EU membership and agree to the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters for the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the naming change is world membership in the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that achieved independence after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I'm here today to voice the future of this country, for the youth of Macedonia, so they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for us all," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the violence is not binding according to the law, an adequate number of members of the parliament have said that they will follow the result of the violence to make her decisive.
In order for the naming change to take place, Parliament needs two-thirds termination.
The State Election Committee reported that nothing unusual had happened by 13.00 p.m.
Only 16 percent had voiced, in contrast to 34 percent in previous 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 of all registered voters had been voiced.
"I love my children, we belong to Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voiced in Strumika in the People's War in Macedonia for whether to change their name and open to join NATO and the EU on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of the referendum in front of parliament in Skopje, by setting up tents and chairs.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not to change our country's name," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us under the name Macedonia, we can go to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev has stated that membership in NATO will draw investors to Macedonia, which has over 20 percent unemployment.
"I believe that the majority will be voiced for the change, by your 80 percent of our citizens will become a member of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after stealing.
He said that a "yes" result can be interpreted as a "steading of our future."
A poll last Monday by Macedonia's Institute of Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters are going to take part in the referendum - which is below the necessary number.
Another poll by Telma TV channel in Macedonia showed that 57 percent of voters plan to voice on Sunday.
Of these, the channel said 70 percent were going to voice yes.
In order for the population to be closed, at least 50 percent must be voiced, plus one is voiced.
If the referendum is not closed, it may damage the policy of the leftist government taking over in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling wrecked the Brighton defense leading to 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday in the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look laughable easily, as he scora for 65 minutes.
The Argentine tip welcomed a pass on the midway at the start of the sequence.
He ran past three Brighton defense players and reached open orbit.
Suddenly, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender, before running past several others on the edge of the Brighton penalty field.
He got past a pass on his left and found Sterling.
The English tip used its first kick in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot right into the right end of the goal.
"Aguero still struggles with his feet," said City coach Pep Guardiola to reporters.
"We talked about he being able to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scora when he did."
But it was Sterling who gave them sky blue the first advantage of the Premier League game.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero welcomed the ball deep inside the Brighton territory.
He kicked the ball beautifully along the left end of the path to Leroy Sane.
Sane held on the ball while leading Sterling to the goal.
The sky blue tip kicked the ball into goal just before he shot out of orbit.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group phase at 12:55 on Tuesday in Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will play spoilers against Rockies in American baseball
With the Nationals eliminated from "playoff content" there was not much reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has high competitive instincts, and hopes to take the "sound" on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to "playoff" for Rockies, who hires with one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies won at least 5-2 against Nationals Friday night, but look forward to locking the fixed first division title.
"Even if we don't play for anything, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the public and the other team most likely playing at the highest level so far this year.
Who wouldn't want to play with such relationships?"
It is still uncertain who to start in Nationals on Sunday, but it may be Scherzer should "pitche".
Scherzer, who then starts for 34th time, threw a "bullpen session" on Thursday and is to "pitche" normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, coming from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 "strikeouts" in 220 2/3" openings this season.
Trump collects voters in West Virginia
The president referred in obscurity to his first election for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance it was for Republicans to vote in the United States middle elections.
"Everything we've done so far is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I don't run around everywhere to fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see that it's happening right now.
And they are informed that they will certainly take back the power, you see how awful they are, how nasty they are.
They don't care who they sow, who they have to run over to take the power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "motivate and block."
"And you can see it based on the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "not and slamming and nasty and dishonest."
He referred to Senator and Democrat Diane Feinstein, who got his audience to bow.
"Do you remember her answer?
Are you the one who leaked documents?
Eh, eh, what?
No, oh no, I'm expecting - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've seen."
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They are intolerant to those who say what they mean
When the Momentum activists in my local party voiced to censor me, it was not surprising.
I am the last in a series of Labour-MPs that have been told that I am not welcome - just to say what I mean.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she protested anti-Semitism.
In my case, I became criticized for being ineligible with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding how important it is to run responsible economy, national security, Europe, and other similar themes such as Jeremy ironically was ineligible with former leaders about.
In the call for the meeting of Nottingham East Labour on Friday, it said, "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
In my last eight years as Labour MP, Friday meetings have been just like this.
Unfortunately, today's meeting was not like this, and the promise of "snillare" policies is extended forgotten, if at all it was followed.
It has become more and more apparent that different viewpoints are not tolerated in Labour, and that each meaning is judged by the leaders of the party.
This occurred shortly after Jeremy became party leader, when colleagues I pled to be politically alone with suddenly expected that I should vote and be alone in matters I would never say one thing in - if it were so about national security or the internal market in the EU.
When I speak publicly, it doesn't matter what I say, I always get to yell at social media and people want me to resign while criticizing center politics and saying I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who get gender discrimination and racist chikanes directed against themselves every day, and who are still professional and not going away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time period, is how normalized it has become to harass police officers.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should become more tolerant.
In the violence, we are no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone. For each mistrust proposal and for each change in the party rules, the party becomes narrower and narrower.
I have received many advice over the past two years from people who have said I must take it with calm and not be so loud, so maybe people will "like me better."
But that's not why I chose to join politics.
When I entered Labour, when I still went to school 32 years ago, it was because I was angry with Thatcher and how the government failed the country. My classroom was falling together, so I would have better public services for those who need them the most - if that were as councillor or government minister.
I've never hidden my political opinions, either in the previous election.
Nobody in Nottingham East may have been in doubt about what I stand for and who of the current leaders I am not alone with.
To those who voiced the proposal on Friday, I can only say that when the country crashes against a Brexit that will harm private, local agencies and public services, then I don't understand why people care about throwing away energy on asking questions about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But actually, then isn't the only message I have directed to Nottingham Momentum, but to voters in the election crash, if they're Labour selectors or not: I'm proud to serve you dive, and I promise nobody can make me go off or change my policy and prevent me from serving dive in the way I think is best for diving everyone.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unforgiven Ayr goes to top in Scottish rugby
Two late "tries" may cause the result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr intended to win in this very entertaining Tennent's Premiership game today.
They now stand on top of the pallet as the only invincible layer of a total of ten.
It was their sovereign defense and ability to take chances that gave the home team and their coach, Peter Murchie, good reason to be satisfied.
"We have been seen trying in the last games, and we are still invincible, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Ayr seduces praise, they were better than us to take chances."
Grant Anderson had a "try" in the 14th minute, where Frazier Climo tried a "conversion," which put Ayr in front, but a yellow card from Scotland captain Rory Hughes of Warriors let Melrose gather, and Jason Baggot took an "unconverted try."
Climo was given a penalty just before the break, he scora and "converted" a "solo try" to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's "try," which became "converted" by Baggot, reduced the slinging demon by five points.
A long break occurred when Ruaridh Knott became seriously damaged and placed on his bows, and from restart fauk Ayr forward through a "try" from Stafford McDowall, like Climo "converted."
The acting captain of Ayr, Blair MacPherson, received yellow cards, and again Melrose tried an "unconverted Bruce Colvine try," at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to deal with Climo without the ball from the penalty position, MacPherson scora a "try."
Climo "converted" again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's "box kick" and sent "flakes" Gregor Henry away from his home team's fifth "try."

The Scottish Still Game star, Ford Kieran, seems ready for a new career in the restaurant business, after it was discovered that he is the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays together with partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season is going to be the last, and it seems Kiern plans his life after Craigang.
According to official lists, he is the CEO of Avengern Limited.

"Havet is ours: Bolivia hopes court will open water road to the Pacific Ocean
Sears patrol marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flags with sea blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are covered with the motto: "Havet is ours. We are right
and duty to return to it."
In landlocked Bolivia, the people can still be remembered a coastline the country lost to Chile, in a bloody conflict about resources in the 19th century. They long to sail in the Pacific again.
These hopes are perhaps stronger than in many decades while Bolivia is awaiting the verdict from the International Court of Justice to arrive on October 1, after five years of re-election.
"Bolivia has driven, insane and is foreina, and, of course, anticipates a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are going to look at the ruling of the International Court of Justice, hoping that the Court of the Hague supports Bolivia's claim, and that Chile - after decades of negotiations - Bolivia provides an independent exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia - who struggles to be elected again next year - has good reason to hope for a positive result.
"Now we will soon return to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
But some analysts do not believe the court will allow Bolivia to access the sea - and that little would have changed even if they were given access.
The Netherlands-based UN court has no power to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia, and has stipulated that they will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
That the court ruling comes only six months after the last negotiations, indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Over the past four years, far from the front of Bolivia's cause, they have done the opposite.
"The concept of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales, with his contentious rhetoric, has killed what was left of Chile's goodwill, suggested Zárate.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the issue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will get "a extraordinary opportunity to open new relationships with Chile" and a chance to "set stretch at 139 years of uncertainty and rather benefit both," he said.
Calzadilla also rejected that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used this maritime issue to win runners.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The pocket is a possibility to see what we need to do to forget the past."
North Korea says they will not abolish nuclear weapons if they cannot rely on the United States
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation cannot be the first to abolish, if they cannot rely on Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday in the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to follow up on the lift they gave during the Singapore meeting between the American and North Korean leaders.
Ri's comments come at a time when the United States' foreign minister, Mike Pompo, seems to want to restart its locked nuclear weapons diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the United States has a false hope that North Korea will be subordinated if the United States continues sanctions and opposes any declaration of the end of the Korean war.
Washington is heading towards agreeing to any declaration of the end of the war, without Pyongyang abolishing first.
Both Kim and the U.S. President, Donald Trump, will hold a new meeting.
But many are critical that Pyongyang believes serious in the construction and that the country most likely sees its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows that massive main garments are the last fashion on the way to a shopping street near you
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, then you don't have to look anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a number of large and special main garments in their SS19 collection. The main plaque biased the audience during the fashion week in Paris.
Highly impractical hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creations right on the catwalk.
The most magnificent garment was an lavish, beige Valentino hat with a feather-like, at brem covering the models' heads.
It also fans other oversized heights during the fashion show, including a jewelry watermelon, a wizard hat, and even an ananas - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of bizarre masks - just in time before Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had lips sewed together and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, complete with snoring and mask, while another looked like a melted ice in biscuits.
If you like this huge dramatic fashion, you can just rejoice.
Fashion experts predict that the enormous hats come for sale in a shopping street near you.
The oversized hats come right after "La Bomba", the straw hat with the 60 centimeters wide strap that has been seen on celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratakijkowski.
The cult brand behind the highest impractical hat, which was everywhere on social media, has now sent a new creation out on the catwalk - a straw beach bag on the same size as the bikini-clothed model carrying her.
Strandveska, with color of burnt orange and fringes topped with a white leather handle, was the most conspicuous part of Jacquemus's La Riviera SS19 collection during the fashion week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage commented to FEEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer - the designer has made so great impression that I doubt that it goes to ignore the demand for oversized heights."
John Edward: Global citizens need language skills
Private schools in Scotland are known to lie on high academic level, and this continues in 2018 with excellent graduation results, which is only enhanced by individual and common success in sports, arts, music and other community measures.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), work with offering the best services to students and their parents.
Self-sufficient schools aim to prepare their students on ongoing and higher education, career paths, and the role of global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailored curriculum, we see that modern languages are popular electives in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, the message goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we can not only lean in English when we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries.
By looking at the graduation results from this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest standing grades for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who took native language received A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, shows that 72 percent of students received A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who took German, 69 percent of those who took French, and 63 percent of those who took Spanish also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support native language as vital features, such as children and young people certainly will need in the future.
Languages such as electives are regarded as equivalent to STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering studies, and mathematics) in the curriculum of self-employed schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the British Selection for Addition and Properties in 2014 showed that 17 percent of employers struggled to fill positions due to lack of language skills in the applicants.
Therefore, it is more and more important with language in school to prepare the youth of the working life.
With several job secrets for linguistics, these properties are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever kind of career a youth chooses, if they have learned a second language, they have a proper advantage in the future with such a property.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person advantages in a competitive world.
Following a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adult Brits in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any other language than English well enough to hold a conversation walking, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language training for our children.
Being able to several languages, especially languages used in developing countries, can give children a better chance to find good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, each school is different in terms of which language they teach.
Many schools focus on the classical modern languages, while others teach language that is classified as important in the UK when we look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child interests, there will always be an amount of language to choose between in self-employed schools, and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated and want to create a learning environment that will prepare children and provide the properties they need to close, no matter what future breaks.
It cannot be rejected that in this global, business-oriented environment, language is vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be called "international communication properties."
Self-sufficient schools will continue to offer this election, and so offer diversity and high competence for Scotland's young people.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools
LeBron debuts in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait time is soon over for fans who are glimmering to see LeBron James debuting on the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the preseason match on Sunday, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how long he will play, has not been decided yet.
"It's going to be more than one minute and less than 49," Walton announced on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James will most likely play a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' schedule for the preseason.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to make me ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump begins on a whirlwind of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five scheduled stop the coming week, including stops in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote on hold to choose to fill the Supreme Court's vacancy, Trump aims to build support for upcoming mid-way elections since the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are to be given in November.
How time should Trump be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you see it online?
Trump's collection in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see Trump's West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely address this week's hearings of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense with charges of sexual abuse, with an expected confirmed vote from the Senate waiting for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the primary goal of this caven of collections is to help the Republicans meet November elections and get some momentum (drive power).
So President Trump's campaign says these five gatherings in the next week are aimed at "opposing volunteers and supporters that Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the busy campaign season," a spokesman for the Trump campaign who refused to be enlightened to Reuters.
Planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the collection of the evening break can support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from Pittsburgh media", according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tries to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is in demand in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come and try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political researcher at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows stomach for battle to keep hope alive on the singles on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon waterfalls could only be that of this Ryder Cup trong.
The swinging pendulum of torque is an entirely invented sport concept, but one that players really believe in, and never more than on competitions like these.
So where would they say that momentum is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now it's four, so we take it as a little moment, I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he spad off for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points lead by twelve more in games.
The Americans, like Spieth say, know that they have a little wind in their sails, and they have a lot to be encouraged by, not least, the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each has three points from four.
Spieth has been mortal from tee to green and hires for example.
The boyural screamed by the celebration was higher when his round continues, seeking an important cut to take match four all-squao.re when he and Thomas had been two down after two.
His cut that won them the game of 15, was met with a similar scream, the type that tells you that he believes the American team is not out of this.
"You've actually just been digging deep and worried about your own fight," Spieh said.
There are all of these players left now.
18 holes to create a brand.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the invincible story of Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but cute couples are four from four and can't make any mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple to not shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back nine (the last nine holes on a path with 18 holes) on Friday morning.
That race, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this noisy audience, cementing that they are the players to be beat on Sunday, and there would be no more popular players to seal a potential European says as the sun descends over Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
Talk about European honor will be even too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did short work by Sergio Garcia, the morning's fourball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bookey and two doubles on the first nine, rough Spanish and Swedish into a hole they never came close to climbing out.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
Thefourballs and phourssomes are so fascinating to look at closely because of the interaction between opponents, advice them give, and advice they do not give and the way a strategy can change at a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and takes a significant lead into the last day, but this waterfall session also showed that Team USA has the stomach of the game as someone, especially Stateside, had doubted.
Europe takes 10-6 lead in the Ryder Cup Final
Europe will have a healthy advantage into the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's fourballs andfoursome games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari hired the charge with two wins over a broken Tiger Woods to take their game so far on Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side laid a pledge to keep the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a mist American side in morning footballs, taking the series 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in waterfalls and won two games, but they could not get in the undershot.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from the 12 single games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, called "Milliwood" after an uplifting weekend, is only the second pair to win four points from their opening in four games in the Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in footballs, they seemed so great to beat an outright Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more coveted 5 and 4.
Woods, who struggled through two games on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliantness, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and waterfalls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who knulled for morning footballs, returned to partner Henry Stenson in fourssomes to a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - rated one and three in the world.
Europe didn't even get everything they wanted in a pleasant, blue-day southwest of Paris.
Three times major win Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas put the reference to the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won a brave 2 & 1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in footballs and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in waterfalls when they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Just twice in Ryder Cup history, a team has come back from a four-point sublayer and entered singles, though as holders, Furyk's side only needs to draw to keep the trophy.
However, after being the second best for two days, it looks like a Sunday counterattack will be outside of them.
North Korea says it doesn't come to speak to rust down unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told Saturday to the United Nations that if sanctions continue, the distrust of the United States will be greater, and that the country would in no way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world government that North Korea had made "degradable measures" to improve relations over the past year, for example, they have stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and do not promise to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't get any equivalent back from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri, a known North Korean, has performed several complaints over Washington's opposition to a "phase" approach to the abolishing of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be paid to take gradual steps, his resignation proved significant in that he did not reject a unilateral nuclear downbuilding, such as Pyongyang has done earlier.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit any anger between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work for "downbuilding nuclear power on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed conversations to facilitate tough international sanctions in North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on "rebuilding nuclear power first" and increases pressure with sanctions to achieve its purpose of coercion, and they even contradicted "the declaration of quitting peace," Ri said.
"Trua that sanctions can crack us, is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that when sanctions continue, our distrust is only greater."
Ri mention nothing about plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. President highlighted in the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, over the past five months and added: "Showing the party in this call for the reconstruction of nuclear weapons was South Korea, and not the United States, the reconstruction of the Korean peninsula would not have stopped as it has now done"
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year, when he told the F.N. General Assembly that it was not possible to stop North Korean rockets against the U.S. mainland, after the evil president Trump called Kim a rocket man on suicide missions.
Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, ausa praise over Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work still had to be done and that sanctions had to remain in place to North Korea determinate its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for this, saying: "If it takes two years, three years, or five months, he doesn't play a role."
China and Russia claim that the F.N. Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the measures made.
But the United States Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told F.N.'s Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanctions of the Security Council still need to be sustained severely and without failing to get the complete, final, verified deviation of the nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 tostrup means to Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo faced Ri on the sideline of the F.N. General Assembly and afterwards said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, but few hours later North Korea condemns him to make "gangster-like demands."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also an atomic complex if the U.S. did "equivalent measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "equivalent measures" he sought were security guarantees such as Trump promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalization of Washington's relationship.
Harvard students take courses in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University has this year helped all students get more sleep, in an attempt to fight the growing macho culture that involves studying in caffeine all night. That is, you use caffeine to stay awake all night to study.
An academies found that students at top universities often unconscious in terms of the very best basic - how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of his battle in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of that, a girl came up to me and said, "Why am I told this now, at adulthood?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains the students what is important for how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after students suffered seriously worse sleep during the week.
The hourly course involves a variety of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dorm, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know, the health effects by choosing to smoke cigarettes, let Prof. Czeisler.
Trust culture over the days still exists, he said and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Making sure you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even avoiding going up in weight, since sleep deprivation puts the brain in sleep mode and makes them constantly sulfur.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, having been a student with him last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push on to get a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before starting at the prestigious institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting in an alarm for when to go to bed, and also for when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" coming from electronic screens and LED lighting, and which can convert the inner clock overall, causing problems with sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goals give Gerrard's men down
Rangers recaptured a new defeat on the away track when Dolly Menga's post sent Steven Gerrard's out-side to a 1-0 loss on Livingston.
The Ibrox page was on the lookout for taking its first sign on away since 4-1-triumfen on St Johnstone in February, but the team of Gary Holt caused only Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as leader, giving eight points, a round under Ladbrokes leader of the Premier League, Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-time, and a Ranger setting with missing inspiration never seemed to be equal.
As the Rangers now fall down to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is located just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be additional problems in stock for Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a wound in the head, after an item apparently was thrown from the away side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team celebrating Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt , on the other hand, went with Livy 11 taking a point with a run-off last week, and he would have been thrilled by the way his well-drilled outfit took the Quaker roof on his opponents on each shift.
Rangers might have the ball most , but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scored after just two minutes when Menga's first post sent Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder failed in his fight chances.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot far on the retreat.
Rangers took control, but it seemed to be more hope than belief in their game in the final third round.
Alfredo Morellos knew he would have had a penalty of 20 metres when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson waved away the wishes of the colombian.
Rangers managed only two shots on goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly concerned by Lassana Coulibaly's head and a tam shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the rules of play, no one can deny that they hated it only because of the "shot".
Again, the Rangers failed to handle a deep deathball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher beat Scott Robinson's ball, which stayed cool to pick out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard left in the break as if he traded Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and bytes caused an immediate impact when the winger made a hatch for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly race ahead to block.
However, Livingstone continues to list the guest team to play the exact game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sending long-running long-running shot.
Holt's team could have increased their lead at the end, but McGregor laughed well in preventing Jacobs in it, until Lithgrow laid a long post from the corner mark.
Ranger's reserve, Glenn Middleton, had a new claim for penalty when he supported with Jacobs, but again saw Thomson.
Almanakk: The inventor of the geiger
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and VI REKAR ... the day when he was to become physicist John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that ultimately led to the apparatus known as the Geiger counter.
As a scientific carrier beam ever since then, the Geiger counter was also a carrier beam in the pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado, with the seemingly falselylate cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in all the world is it?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger satellite, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms caused by the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: "Yes, now bubble it!"
"His" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention calling his name, lives on.

Vaksine teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, as part of the treatment

A trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with a number of cancers.
A woman treated with adultina, who teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, experienced that the ovarian cancer flooded for more than 18 months.
The method involves drawing out immune cells from a patient, leaving them in the laboratory, allowing them to "see" a protein common to many cancer forms, called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "Driving the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to extract immune cells from patients and "learning" them how they target cancer cells, has served in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West commissioned a Pro-Trump-diatribe, wearing an MAGA-lue, after he guested the TV show Saturday Night Live. .
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was released in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an incredible performance where he praised the United States' president, Donald Trump, and said he would set for election in 2020.
After taking his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, where he wore a Make America Great caps, he gave the Democrats a tithe and repeated his support to Trump.
"So many times I speak to a white person, and they say: "How could you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a number along with comedian Matt Damon, where Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in Senate court selection on the charges of sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not sent, West's tenade footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock attempted to mock West with the post.
West had also complained to the public that he had the difficult backstage due to his main garment.
"They bullied me behind the scene.
They said: Don't go out there with that hat on.
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a downhill place," he said, according to Washington Examinor.
West continued: "Will you see the broken space?" says he would "take on the superman cap, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments led to outpipe at least twice from the audience, and SNL cast members seemed embarrassingly affected, reported Variety, with a person there who told the publication: "Heile the studio was fatal."
West was brought in as a late substitute for singer Ariana Grande, when her former girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner as tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: TAKK FOR AT YOU STORY PURE PUBELEN."
But talkshow host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "perhaps simply just as he is and it's absolutely amazing."
"But I chose NOT to pay someone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") that I think embraces and asks out ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
That's us too" she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Medrappar, Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and of course the last music legend Prince, changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was previously known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington goes out against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-winging role as Jon Snow in HBO's selected medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actress, 31, has gone out against the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen often cause young gutts to feel they must be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes that something has gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones comedian Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he knows "quite strongly" to address the problem.
"Personally, I am informed that something has gone wrong with the masculinity." he said.
"What have we learned men when they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that TV is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to very male characters.
He continues: 'What is congenital and what is taught?
What is learned on television and in the streets, what makes young guts feel that they must be this particular side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the major questions of our time - how do we change it?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not make Game of Thrones precursors or sequels when the series ends this summer, saying he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a remake of Sam Shepards True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actress recently revealed that he looks at the meeting with his wife Rose to be the best coming out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this show, so in that way it gave me my future family and my life further," he said.
Rose played Ygrette, the named Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 8200,000 people are framed in the country, says health-aided.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transferred through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV quickly spread through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the amount of people who received HIV this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health professionals said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transfer through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/HTQ individuals is claimed to be widespread floods.
Due to the conservative values in the country, studies have affirmed that 70-90% of men who have sex with men, ultimately will marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an attempt to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to add salmon information from GOP senator, it explodes in 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
United States Rep. Maxine Wasers condemned Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations were pedaled by "extrem-right wing" searches and web pages.
"Licks, lies, and more contemptious lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information included information on home addresses and phone numbers of Americans Sens. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing about the charges of sexual assault against Supreme Court-elected Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came once after the three Senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Purdit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was connected to Waters' offices and released the information to a member of Waters' staff, reported Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continues.
"One of my added - which has gained its identity, personal information, and security compromised as a result of these urety and false claims - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Water's resignation quickly received criticism online, including from former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests that she has no temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they must not be angry.
They must not be tough.
They must not ask questions about the motives of the debtor.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer was found to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats by Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being apparent to anger during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who attempts to take over Water's place in the midway election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he tweeted.
In her resignation, Waters said her office had alerted "the right governments and the law enforcement units of these false claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are revealed," she continues, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all of their actions that are devastating and dangerous to each and every one of my fellow workers."
Johnny English beats again - spy customs of weak Rowan Atkinson
It is traditional to look for Brexit marks in all new films with a British angle, and it works current for this revivement of Johnny England's action comedy spoof franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and which was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will selfish satire dealing with how openly we are, become the new export authority in the country?
In any case, the grand, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber-andlet has for the second time renewed its permission to fuck things up - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comedian for cinematologists in non-English-language countries.
Of course, he is the foolish, secret agent who despite his bizarre desires to spread a little glamour has received a small bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a portion of that guy contributing a simple melody to the Ildcars, themes during the 2012 London Olympic opening ceremony.
He is also originally based on the traveling and international mysterious man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos in the aftermath.
There are one or two fine moments in this last JE excursion.
I love Johnny English approaching a helicopter while dressed in a medieval armor suit while the rotor blades strike his helmet.
Atkinson's walk to physical comedy is on screen, but humor feels quite weak and strangely superfluous, especially since "serious" film marks such as 007 and Mission Impossible even now safely offer comedy as an ingredient.
Humor feels as if he is directed to children rather than adults, and for me Johnny England's noise is not so inventive and focused as Atkinson's replica use is noised in the person of Bean.
The permanent current lead now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber attacker has infiltrated Britain's supersecret web network of spies, covering the identities of all agents Britain has in the area, for the behavior of the agent at work - a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for a Prime Minister who is a pompous and war-hungry figure, who already has a complete breakdown of political opulence: Emma Thompson does his very best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but it's not so much in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that when every active spy has been accused, she must bring in someone retired.
And that means that the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works as a teacher at a somewhat elegant establishment , but provides unofficial lessons on how to work undercover: a few fine jokes here, since English offers a School of Rock-type academia for spying.
English is sent back to Whitehall for a naud situation briefing and reunited with its former understanding assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moved over to a submarine driver job, an overtatusian role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit discarded.
So Batman and Robin's ability to get things to become fearful gale in Henri Majesty's Secret Services is back for full in the meeting with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful five-me fatal, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the charismatic technology billionaire's outrage, which claims he can solve the United Kingdom's data problems: the intruder Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of far-like wild games: disguised as servitators, they set fire on a fine French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggler aboard Volta's lightboat; and English triggers clean anarchy as he tries to use a Virtual Reality head set to make himself familiar with the interior of Volta's house.
All stops are surely drawn out to the last sequence, but so loving and undisciplined as it is, there is quite a lot of child-TV across it all.
Quite moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't be thinking: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes justice to his talents?
Labour Labour Labour Labour Labour's Labour Labour Labour Labour Labour Party refuses to work out a plan for the English to work a four-day week, but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyns Labour party is now considering a radical plan that will allow the British to work a four-day week - but is paid for five.
The party, according to the report, will send further savings done through artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees, by giving them an extra day of free time.
Then would add could enjoy a three-day weekend - yet receive the same salary.
Sources said the idea would "pass" with the economic agenda of the party and plan to increase benefits for employees.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for employees to benefit from the changed economy.
An older source from Labour told The Sunday Times: A policy message is expected announced before the end of the year.
'It doesn't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a desire that fits into the approach the party has to balance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as superior to the party's industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week in its 2017 campaign.
However, the ambition is not approved by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour party spokesman said: "A four-day work week is not party policy and it is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell spent last week's work conference to enhance his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to take back power from "unintended directors" and "professionals" in wealthy businesses.
The plans of the shadow hurricane also mean that current shareholders in the water disposal cannot regain their entire effort when a Labor government could make "returns" due to perceived misdemeanor.
He has also confirmed plans to put employees in corporate boards and created Inclusive Ownership Funds (including ownership funds) to provide 10 percent of the equity in the private sector added, which would receive annual dividends of up to $500, approximately $5,000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, tells the TV program "60 Minutes" about FBI s in investigating Kavanaugh could have them change their thoughts
The FBI inquiry into complaints against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and it raises the question of what extent found to the agency could affect some Republican senators to draw their support.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked in "60 Minutes" Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could reveal something that would make them vote.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said on my way into the hearing, I said, I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that claim came out and said, 'Have you done it?'
He was best-known, firm-minded, unknowingly."
However, Graham's voice seems to have been seen in stone.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite appeal to change me," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it powerful, "la Graham to, and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all she names could not confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changed."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday is New York hosted the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormously impressive display of stars acting and an equally impressive mission; ending poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocked to the Central Parks major lawn, not only to enjoy seeing Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes performing, but also to increase the wit of the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert whites had to complete a number of tasks, or "actions" as a volunteer work; send email to a world leader, call a phone call or other meaningful ways to help increase the wit of their goal of ending poverty.
But how great success has Global Citizen been with 12 years again to reach its goal?
Is the idea of paying people with a free concert a real way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called "clickivism" - people feel they make a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has registered more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, participating in and pushing for a variety of goals.
It says that these actions have contributed to world leaders being able to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $337 billion, which will affect the lives of more than $225 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group showed 390 commitments and announcements as a result of their actions, hence at least $10 billion already paid or collected.
The group estimates that they secured the waists so far have had direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a British based partner of investors and developers who are committed to "helping children to reach their full potential"; promising to give Rwanda 35 million dollars to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," told the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after they had taken more than 5,000 action to demand the UK to improve on nutrition for mothers and children, the British government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition treatment.
In response to one of the common questions on their website, they ask "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizens responded: "It will be a long and difficult way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements lead us, we will loop, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is among some of the actors performing at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Fleet as "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports - interior secretary
Washington may "if necessary" resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, international secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where they operate on the invitation of the legitimate government - is an effort to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to convey energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and mids to tackle it.
"The U.S. has this ability, with our fleet, to make sure the sea roads are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure their energy is not going on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event held by Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group presenting itself as "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to handling Russia and Iran, and noted that they are actually the same.
"The economic solution to Iran and Russia is more or less to utilize and replace fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as an "one-trick pony" with an economy depending on fossil fuels.
The declarations come as the Trump administration has been commissioned to increase exports of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
In connection with this, officials in Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" North Stream 2 movement project, which according to Trump, made Berlin Moscow's "catch".
Moscow has repeatedly underlined that the North Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to dedo the existing pipeline capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington's keen opposition to the project is only driven by economic reasons, and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the position that energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," Russian energy minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. holding has withdrawn backlash from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leadership organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state disrupts our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, leader of the German industrial association (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "run hard" to run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would take a "ground look" to run for president after the midway election.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our poor government, and it includes a woman on top," she according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider thoroughly running for president."
Warren entered President Donald Trump during the Town Hall meeting and said that he "do this country in the wrong direction."
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren has been outraged in his criticism by Trump and his Supreme Court-elect Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's own voters do not suggest that she should run as a candidate in 2020.
51 percent of "true" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run as a candidate, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/ Boston Globe investigation.
Thirteen percent supported such a candidate.
The survey showed more support for a round of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 ruling, include former vice-president Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin's PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) at Donald Trump Collection
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being enlisted in September.
He was arrested and charged with an election event at home on Monday night
"What my own son goes through, what he goes through when he returns, allows me to relate to other families that are characterized by PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers return with," she said to the audience at a gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in space" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little changed, they come back here, they come back and wonder about the respect for what they and fellow soldiers and flyers and all other military, have done for the country, exist".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was accused of physical violence in the home against a woman, for disrupting a report of violence in the home and storage of a weapon while he was rushed, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, D.C. Support Challenge for New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and districts in Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang power or violence in the home.
Representatives from the 18 states and district filed a friend-of-law short Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in Grace v. Sessions is suitable for the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Freedom Union) filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said that her partner "and the elected gang member girls" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the States supporting Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, producing a large amount of applicants for U.S. asylum, which nations face pervasive problems with gangs and violence in the home.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by immigration law, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing violence in the home, to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores many decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum cases to be judged for the particular fact and circumstances of the claim, and such an obstacle contradicts this principle," said friend-of-right card.
Lawyers further claimed in the summary that policies that deny immigrant access, damage the United States economy, and say it is more likely that they become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary work".
Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer give asylum to victims who fled abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asyl is available to those who leave their homeland due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in June 11 in its announcement of politics.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems - even all serious problems - which people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue work in Palu while death toll doubled in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation was increasingly serious.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who thrashed her fever-sucking baby son at an evacuation center in the broken town, Palu.
"Each minute ambulances come with bodies.
Clean water is hard to find."
Residents have been observed on their way back to their broken homes, in what they are searching through water-damaged owners and trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospital destroyed by the earthquake, which had a force of 7.5, was crowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken back and shoulder, questioned outside Palu's Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to still strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes while telling him that he knew the powerful earthquake shook the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the rubble of the wall, I think, " told Haris to the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife yelling for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe."
US ambassador blames China for "mobbing" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a 4-page advertisement in an American daily newspaper and highlighted the mutual advantages of trade with the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador accused China Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
United States President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's paid incumbent in Des Moines register - State Iowa's largest salsavis - having accused China of trying to mix in the United States congressional elections on November 6, a charge China denies.
Trump's charge that Beijing tried to mix in American elections, marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign of Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has seen them in the innings increase taxes on each other's import.
China's retaliation tariffs early in the trade war were designed to match exporters in states such as Iowa supporting Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had injured American workers, farmers, and businesses.
“China,” Branstad wrote in a statement in Sunday’s Des Moines register, “doubr now bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
"In its dissemination of propaganda, the Chinese government uses itself by America's beloved tradition of freedom of expression and a free press by posting a paid ad in the Des Moines register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the avantiosque down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and will not see any true mirroring of the various meanings that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic path, given that the media is under the fixed thumb of the Chinese Communist Party "creating it.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers rejected the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say what a newspaper.
Republicans demand female voters lead midterm with Kavanaugh Debacle, warns Analytics.
As many top Republicans are stand-by and defend Supreme Court-elect Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several charges of sexual assault, the analyst has warned that they will probably see a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming midway elections.
The feelings surrounding this have been extremely high, and most Republicans are on record that they already wanted to move on with a voice.
These things cannot be undone, says Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) last moment's push for an FBI investigation will be enough to row angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow, and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday. Washington, DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang "November comes!" while they demonstrated in the hall of the Senate when the Republicans, who rule the Court Committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be outside the chart," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partic political analyst, to the news page.
"People say it has already been high, it's true.
But it can become higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds, who, while they don't like the president, often don't like votes."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the allegations of sexual abuse directed at the appointed Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed forward with the confirmation.
"This has been a confusing mess for GOP," said Michael Steele, former leader of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote of the committee or final vote or whether Kavanaugh is set on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they've treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priories USA, a group that contributes to choosing Democrats, pointed to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be a bit split over who they are going to believe in in the wake of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more sidetracks with the latter.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied to during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations presented by Ford, and also at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford quotes the Judicial Authority Committee of the Senate under oath last week that Kavanaugh completely assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her gender organs while attending a party during the time they studied at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup seeking to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The last project of technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built by Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where data is stored and what people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the meaning of Inrupt is "worlddomination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solids technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data warehouse" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, remember lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a web browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access all kinds of information.
The company calls it "personal government through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the managing director of the company John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, process and appropriate abilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company consists at the moment of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some added developers with contracts to work with the project, as well as a community of volunteer codes.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google to not file a complete change where all their business models are completely turned on the head overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a media post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new online collection built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute for Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice with great influence in the debate on online neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation, and Open Data Institute.
"I'm probably optimistic about this next era online," added Berners-Lee ten l.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross Divine Feira
The only English church divine which won a Victoria choir during World War I as a giant has been celebrated in its hometown 100 years afterwards.
Lt Col Pastor Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was "brilliant symbolic", that the stone would be unveiled just 100 years after his grandfather's award winning performance.
According to London Gazette, Lt Col Vann hired his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918 "through a very thick shoe and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later ran up to the front line, and with the "largest galantani" the line forwarded before alone rushing forward with a field gun and knocked out three of the group.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of his grandfather were "some I know I could never live up to, but something I am adamant of."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a crane after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he knew very much the era of playing a role in the parade, adding that "the value of a real hero is shown by the support given by many people."
The MMA fan was up all night to see Bellator 206, they got Peppa Gris instead
Prior to this, you have been up all night to see a packed Bellator 206m package so you won't see the main event.
The coverage from San Jose contained 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown live through the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just in what Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepare to meet each other, viewers in the United Kingdom were again stunned when coverage changed to Peppa Gris.
Some were little impressed after they had stayed awake to the early hours especially for the match.
A fan on Twitter possesses switching to the children's comic book as "a sort of sick joke."
"It is public regulation that at 6 o'clock if the inlet was not the property so, then they had to switch to the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked for the transfer.
"Peppa Pig, "yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they are going to work on planning to include British viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think of replay, I think we can probably find out," Coker said.
"But the clock is six in the morning on a Sunday, and we don't find out this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, as it went over, there were many texts that went back and forth, and everyone was not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, next time it won't happen.
We hold it to five games instead of six - which we usually do - and we tried to survive to the fans, and we just went over.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley knew "the inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic stumper Tom Daley says he felt worse than everyone because of his sexuality - but it gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he did not understand until attending ongoing school that "not everyone is like me."
When speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island discussions presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay's rights to give others "hope".
He also said becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular reporter in the long-run show, Kirsty Young, has taken free several months due to illness.
What could look like a welcome in Laverne's first program, Daly said he knew "less than" all others who grew up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to equal cats and girls."
He said: "From now on, the feeling of feeling less than and feeling different has been the real things that have given me power and strength to loop."
He would prove that he was "some", he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist has been a professional LGBT campaign and used his appearance on this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he knew fortunately who could live open without forewords and wanted to give others "håp".
The three-time world champion said that being in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "overraved me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much in such a young age" - he went to his first Olympic age 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar heights and downturns.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that the whole "his" perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all about I need to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Mi Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept his death and one of the last things he had asked for, was if they had tickets to London 2012 - when he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't say to him that you won't be on the front row," he said.
"I kept his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was not until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead as I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew this was what I had been dreaming of all my life - to dive in front of a home audience at an Olympic game, where fans no better sense," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Stolt by Heather Small - who had vibrated with him in the construction of the Olympics and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape his Mickelson on the bench at Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will put a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he must turn his form to avoid it being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a record 12th time, was seen on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk incumbent Saturday's golf game in football and phourssomes.
Rather than being in the middle of the action, which he has often been for the United States, the five-time major winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working with his game within the reach of the hope of correcting what plagiarisms him.
Never the most competent along-line. Not even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is best at hitting along the along-line on the pitch, French main course, where balls hit outside if the golf player is not exactly with the bats.
And if the path itself is not frightening enough, Mickelson meets in the ninth game on Sunday, the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 single games, get to a warm start, Mickelson's fight can be completely determined.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
"He completely understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on his back and let his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has great confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer, and he has added so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he played two games.
I looked for me more, but it was as it was, and it was as we thought we had to do.
He will be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Fuldo's record in most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven halves, although Furyk said his proximity caused some intangible properties to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, entertaining, likes to keep fun with people and he's a nice guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun getting an inning with him as well, this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than just playing."
Europe Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership can soon be delayed
Thomas Bjørn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lease on its way into the last days' singles in Ryder Cup can easily be converted into an unpleasant trip.
The Danish made their debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a side captain of Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came across the finish line with the nose leading with the narrowest margins, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You continue to remind you that we had a great lead on Valderrama; we had a big lead on Brookline, where we lost, and on Valderrama, where we won, but only barely," said Bjørn, after he had seen Klassa 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to rent 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
You go to full opening tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you have the score on the board.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
I've said all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're so well aware of what's on the other side - the biggest actors in the world."
Glad to see how his players have performed on a tough golf course, Bjørn added: "I would never take the lead on ahead.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow, there are the individual achievements that emerge, and there is another thing to do.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you’re out there individually, you’ll be tested full of your capacity as a golfer.
It is the message you need to convey to players; get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he must go and get the best out of himself as well."
In contrast to Bjørn, opposite number Jim Furyk will be on the lookout after his players should perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been in both ends of the snus operations in the last few days, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before ending as Europe left off the "Miracle of Medinah."
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in response to being asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, had gathered his players on their way into the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to get started with the quick start that you saw on Brookline, as you watched Medinah.
When the moment gets to go a way, it puts a lot of pressure on the middlemost matches.
We set up our line-up accordingly and put the boys in a way that feels good, you know, we're trying to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task to try and meet Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the scheme.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole way through," said Bjorn about his choices of singles.
Germany's new warship set out once again
The latest frigate of the German Navy would have been ordered in 2014 to replace aging warships from the Cold War era, but there will not be there until at least next year due to wrong systems and scalable costs, local media reported.
Entry of Rheinland-Pfalz, the leader ship of the split new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, quoting a military spokesman.
The vessel would have joined the fleet in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships Sea defence ordered back in 2007, comes as compensation for the aging Bremen-class frigatets.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful cannon, a number of anti-fly and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from the ports at home level.
Nevertheless, continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships, which apparently allow Germany to exercise power abroad, will already be outdated when entering service, notes Die Zeit.
The accidently F125 retreat made headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There was little known about the reasons for the return, but German media quoted a number of important "software and hardware errors" that made the warship unusable if deployed on a combat task.
Software flaws were especially important when the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half of the workforce on older Bremen rules.
It also turned out that the ship is dramatically overweight, reducing the performance and limiting the ability of the fleet to add future upgrades.
The 7th-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is thought to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the wrong hardware, the price of the whole project - including the training of the crew - is a problem.
It is said to have reached staggering €1.3 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from initial €2.2 billion (EURO)
Problems related to the latest frigates, are especially important in light of the latest warnings that Germany's fleet power decreases.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament defence committee, recognized that the fleet actually "has almost end of distribution-competent ships".
The officer said the problem has been built on over time, because old ships were discontinued, but no replacement vessel was supplied.
He remarked that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigatets were able to join the fleet.
National Trust Toys on Secret Life to Flag Mouse
New research conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands, aims to reveal how the bats use the landscape in hunting food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano piperselles and also brown longs and Daubenton bats on Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS additions and volunteers will also perform mobile searches using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bat calls and what species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural science advisors for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat, natural homes, which are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the advantages of habitat management work such as the acquisition of meadows and how it is best to keep in the same forest area for bats and other associated species.
Flags mice populations in Scotland and over the United Kingdom have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects resting places and loss of habitat/bow sites.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as fly paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, and also attacks of pet cats.
Flags are not really blind.
However, due to their night hunting habits, their island is more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocalization technique to find errors and obstacles in their flight route.
NTS, responsible for care for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and 77,000 hectares of land around the country, take bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly perform surveys, rest space inspections, and sometimes save lives.
The organization has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated flag mouse reserves at Three Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten flag museums.
Property Manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here on Threave we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitats.
But there is much about bats still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties, will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He underscores the importance of checking after bats before performing maintenance within property, since it is possible that infinite destruction of a single bus can kill up to 400 women's bats and young, and perhaps outrave a whole local population.
Flags are the peace and it is illegal to kill, plagiarism, or interfere with them or destroy their resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come in and help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are dangerous."
Ronaldo rejects election debt in what lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has marked the election debt against himself as "false news", saying people "need to highlight" by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus the forward have been accused of electing an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a 2009 Las Vegas hotel.
He is claimed to have paid her $35,000 to keep silent about the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, to its 142 million follow only hours after the charges, say the charges are "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news, says five times the Goldball winner into the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They will be known to say my name, but it is part of the job.
I am a happy man and all good, "let the player even smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers prepare to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "a disillusioned reporting of suspicions within the area of privacy," according to Reuters
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral injury in an amount that accounts for the severity of the breach is , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the room of the player, claiming that he allegedly has chosen her anally, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knee after the supposed incident and told him he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and failed by "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs taken by her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed on a equalization because she felt "smooth of retaliation" and was concerned about "to be publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to change the residence as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'ville forever undone' to lose car manufacturers
Britain "would undo it forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in automobile production after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "about" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of border delays in case a non-contractual Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avenis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, where 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My perception is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we see production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director of Burnaston.
Other British automakers have raised fears of leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The most important concerns about what car manufacturers say are supply chain risks in case of a non-contractual Brexit.
Toyota's production line is driven on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there may be disruptions at the border that the industry says can lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's values of inventory at its Derbyshire factory, said the company, thus production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Checkers plan for future relationships with the EU is "net top calibrated to avoid control at the border."
"We must have an agreement. We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only to enjoy the success today, but for us to seize this possibility," he told BBC Radio 4s day program.
"The paper from not only Toyota, but other manufacturers is that we must absolutely be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term they warned that extra costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the Unite Unions of the plant, said his members are more concerned with: "After my experience, when these jobs go, they never come back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-ranking meeting with deputy attorney Rod Rosenstein could be "pressed back a week" as the game against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who examines Russian election interference, links between Trump helpers and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the President.
Korvidt Trump means up the general of the attorneys or not, thus putting Mueller's self-defence at risk, has given nourishment to Washington gossip for several months.
Earlier in the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed a lease to register conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president using the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, and it was reported that he was going to say up.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "draw" not to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid crashing with the Senate Commission hearing where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who have charged him with sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, quotes.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed full voting from the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "It has not been set any date. It may be this week, but I can and see for me that it will be delayed another week due to everything else that happens in the Supreme Court.
But we get to see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters will probably say unintelligible in it: Sanders has not held a press briefing for the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of orientations was not due to a discontent with TV reporter's game for the gallery, although she said: "I'm not alone in doing so."
She mentioned and that direct contact between Trump and the press is going to increase.
"The president holds more press conferences than any president has done before," she said - right enough without making evidence of the claim. "We have looked at numbers."
Sanders says updates will still happen, but "if the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do it as a part, and you've seen us do it often over the past few weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press briefing if you can talk directly to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when traveling from the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It is unusual for the president to hold press conferences alone.
In New York this week, the president perhaps demonstrated why, where he performed leading the reporters without shame, and almost bizarre.
Health secretary writes of Brexit-frying to workers from the EU at NHS in Scotland
The Health Secretary has written to workers from the EU working at NHS in Scotland to express gratitude and an wish that they continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter although there are less than six months left before Britain withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to addressing the costs of applications that have status as determined by EU residents working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations have ongoing withdrawals between the United Kingdom and the EU have continued, and it approaches the expected conclusion in autumn.
Nevertheless, the British government has stepped up preparations in case there is no deal.
I understand that this must be a difficult time for you all.
Therefore, I will now repeat how much price I have seen on the contributions of all added, no matter what nationality they have.
Collegiates from the EU, and outside, carry valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare sector and are beneficial to patients and communities.
Scotland is clearly diving home, and we would like to dive here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after head injury
Linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays at Tennessee State Tigers, went through an emergency operation after pulling on an injury in his head when the team lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports the newspaper The Tennessee.
Head coach for Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred right before break.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed, in a way," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him behind for further evaluation.
An official Tennessee State spokesman, WSMV told Abercrombie that Abercrombie had finished operating on Vanderbilt medical centers.
There are no details of the extent of the injury yet, Harris said, adding that Tennessee State is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie goes second year at the university, and is in his first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before becoming injured in Saturday's game, and is now up for 18 overall this season.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. The extra income should be used to help the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives.
The decision will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in document fees will be added to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The treasury anticipates an auction of up to 120 million pounds a year - to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. The extra income should be used to help the homeless.
This decision will be regarded as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn has had to attract young voters who serve a lot, with the promise to offer reasonable settlements.
The increase in document fees will be added to individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money should strengthen the government's desire to reduce the number of turnovers.
The fee, which comes in addition to the current document fee, includes the higher levels introduced two years ago on residential number two and unleighed settlements, may be at as much as three percent.
The treasury expects the decision to be brought in up to 120 million pounds a year.
Approximately 13 percent of London's new buildings are purchased by settlers outside the UK. This makes prices higher, and it becomes more difficult for first-time buyers to enter the residential market.
Many well-known areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "sponsored cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who most of the time occupy in other countries.
This new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson would cut in the document fee to help more young people buy their first home.
He charged large construction firms to keep prices up by obtaining property judgments, but not using them, and asked Theresa May to give up quotas on reasonable settlements to fix Britain's "bustadsskam".
Corbyn has announced a series of conspicuous proposals for residential reforms, including controlled leases and the conclusion of expulsions for no reason.
He will and will advise greater power to build new settlements.
May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my position to bringing back the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
This means fixing the broken residential market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
Nevertheless, it may not be right that it should be as simple for individuals who do not live in the UK, or foreign firms, to buy dwellings as it is for hardworking, British settlers.
Too many people have the dream of their own residential area gone too far away, and the audaciousness of being surrounded is real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "ultimate ambition" is to become manager of Scotland at some point.
The cave (42) rejoices over the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east. Currently, they are in third place in League One, just three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish elite series in the previous season.
"I would play for my country as a player.
I won a B national team match, and that was," Ross told Scotland BBC Sportssound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hamden along with my father, and there has always been something that has drawn me back.
That possibility can only come if I have success as club manager."
Ross' predecessors such as Sunderland manager, include Dick Advocate, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he has not been anxious to come after so many established names in such a large club, since he has previously declined approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For the moment, success for me will be measured in if I 'can get this club back in the Premier League."
On the basis of structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they belong at home in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get them there, but I can likely only look at myself as successful if I manage to get the club back there".
Ross is only three years into his career as manager, after a period of assisting chief of Dumbarton and a 15-month period in Hearts' training apparatus.
He then helped Alloa recover from slowdown to third level, and transformed St Mirren, who was heading to advance, to title winner in the championship series the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now, than he ever did while playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a road separation," he says about leading Alloa.
"I thought genuine that being manager matched me much better than being a player.
It sounded bizarre, because I did well, lit well and liked it relatively well.
But playing can be tough.
There are many things you are happy to get you through every week.
I still note it when it comes to the stress and pressure of the job, but it feels right to be manager.
I have always wanted to be manager, and now I am. It's the most comfortable I've felt in my own body throughout my adult life."
Sunday, September 30, you can hear the entire interview at Sportssound, Radio Scotland, between 12 and 13.
Survey shows that the perfect time for a half-liter is at 5:30 a.m. on a Saturday
Summer's hot wave has led to an increase in the intensity of struggling pubs in the United Kingdom, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, sales increased by 2.7 percent in the bar industry - but for the restaurant business it dropped by 4.8 percent, the statistics show.
Business adviser Peter Martin, who stands behind the statistics, said: "The remaining sun, and that England was part of the World Cup longer than planned, means July followed the pattern for June how pubic went up 2.8 percent, only that restaurants became even harder frame.
The decline of 1.8 percent in the restaurant business only worsened in July.
Pubar and bars selling drinks made it significantly better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubar who sells food, gained and noticed the decline in the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It may seem like people will just go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars, the drink hall had increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food had dropped three percent.
Paul Newman, analysts for travel and leisure at RSM, said: "These results are continuing the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather, and the impact of a huge social or sporting event, will still be the biggest factors when it comes to sale in the outdoors industry.
There is no surprise that the restaurant business will still wear. A decrease in sales of 4.8 percent annually will be bad to get on top of a launch cost pressure.

One in five children has secret profiles on social media that they hide from parents
One of five children - some as young as 11 - have secret profiles on social media that they hide from parents and teachers, shows an investigation
Investigation of 20,000 students on continuing reveals an increase in "false Insta" profiles
This news has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a "head" profile they show parents
One of five children - some as young as 11 - stock profiles on social media that they hold secret to adults.
A survey among 20,000 students on ongoing school revealed a powerful increase in "false Insta" profiles - a reference to the photo sharing platform Instagram.
News has increased fear of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of students say they have a sterile "head" profile they refer to parents, while having private profiles.
A mother who stumbled over the secret side of his 13-year-old daughter, found a teenager who urged others to "elect me".
The research, made by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistress' Conference in various schools, found that 40 percent of those between 11 and 18 years had two profiles, and half of these admitted to having private users.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "It's alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create places online where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes "atletane's voice" in the Scottish athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish athletics as non-administrative director of the Board's annual General Assembly.
Doyle is the most decorated track athlete in Scotland, and Chairman Ian Beattie described the incident as a great possibility for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level during the past decade.
"Eilidh has a lot of respect across Scotland, the UK and the world's athletic community, and we are confident that the Scotland athletics can benefit from getting it into the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can help and help the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has gold from both 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996 among his total four Olympic gold and now is a regular guest at the BBC, was unable to go after a drip.
On Twitter, he wrote: "Today it's a month since I got hit.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said it was only the time that could tell me if I came to be good again, or to what extent.
It's been exhausting work, but I've been completely good again, learned to go on again, and today I'm making flexibility boots!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Split units on the Internet on breast pump advertising comparing mothers with milk cows
A breast pump company has split opinion on the Internet with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers with milk cows.
To mark what is described as "the first silent, intoxicating breast pump", the technology company Elvie released a small-frew advertisement inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom of the new pump giving mothers out milk.
Four real mothers dance in a high-filled barn with cows, to a song that includes text like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tail" and "If you don't notice it, this isn't tensions, it's my soups."
The chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed these children, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies".
The complaint, published on the company's Facebook page, has, however, created controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it illuminates "the horror" in the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
As us, they need to get pregnant and food to produce milk, only that the calves are trusted from the only days after birth," one writes.

Another commented: "I understand enough traumatic for both mother and child
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who get to keep their kids?"
Another added: "For a violence television advertising."
Others defended the advertisement, and a lady admitted that she seems to sound "fested."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I were still breast-feeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
This advertisement is a little crazy, but I took him for what he is.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun advertising aimed at mothers such as pumps (often at work or in the toilets) and feels like cows.
This is not an advertisement boasting or judging the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they all have danced with the disk tree pump packed into their BHs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women as pumps, they say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely quiet, has no rents or pipes, and its discreet inside a nursing-BH, giving women freedom to move, keeping their kids, and even going out while pumping.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: "The Elvie pump is a so-pass revolutionary product, that it consumes a daring and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers who extracted milk and milk cows, we wanted to put spotlights on breast pumping and challenges related to this, and at the same time demonstrate the unlikely freedom gap the new pump will bring, in an entertaining and recognizable manner.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During the moteuka in London, a mother appeared to two up on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved in silence to tent camp on the Texas border
The number of imprisoned immigrant children has peaked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the strict policy Trump administration has introduced makes it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that standing up and taking on a child can threaten their own possibility of getting into the country.
The risk of it increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members are being satisfied to submit fingerprints, and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence of Immigration and Customs enforcement testified to Congress and said that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have sought to be sponsors of single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had nothing on their record from before.
"Nearly 80 percent of those either sponsors or family member of sponsors are in the country illegal, and a large part of these are criminal foreigners.
So we should continue to pursue these people," Albence said.
Following the additions of the camp, new rules have now been introduced to handle the children. The rules require some of them to now have in court before a month has passed, against earlier 60 days.
Many will participate via video calls and not at personal attendance, to get their case tried leading an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to selective outbreaks or rumbling disorders, they say added in the camp. Reports that have appeared in the last few months say the same.
Speakers say these concerns are greater at large facilities such as Tornillo. Due to the size of the plant, it is more likely that you ignore signs that children wear.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare themselves emotionally, or say hated to friends, can reinforce trauma that many already struggled with.
Syria calls for U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to retreat
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also requested Syrian refugees to come home, although the country is now at war in the eighth year.
Moualem, who and acting as Deputy Prime Minister, said that emerging forces remain illegal on Syrian soil under the pretext of defeating terrorism, and "will be treated out from it".
"They have to withdraw from the eyebrow and without assumptions," he told the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 300,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to "fight a holy struggle until all Syrian territories have been cleared" for both terrorist groups and "illegal presence of emerging."
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and counseling of both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-hunted country.
When talking about the refugee problems, Moualem said it was safe for them to come back, and he blamed "some western countries" for having "spreided irrational fear" about the environment that caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and the humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return," he said.
"They make policies out of something that would be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help to rebuild in Syria before a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
Diplomats from the UN say that a recently created agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, which is the last major rebel party, has created a possibility to continue pushing forward with political conversations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement abolishes a large attack by Russian-backed, Syrian forces in the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem underlined that the deal had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will be directed to jihadists, including warriors from the nusra front, who are associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be extinct."
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon gather the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition member to prepare a post-war law for Syria, and pave the way for the election.
Moualem lays down conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited "to review the articles of the current constitution," and warned against disruptions.
Why Trump is going to win a term
With that logic, Trump will win the 2020 reelection if not, as many liberal viewers likely hope, the presidency gets an early end due to scandals and impeachment.
It would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic ending on a presidency any anger!"
At the time of writing, there are no signs that viewers have gone bored.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled its rating in best broadcast time to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has nearly tripled its to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBCs "The Rachel Maddow Show" has played at the top of the cable rating with as much as 3.5 million viewers on nights with great news.
"This is a fire that people are closed off, because there is something we don't understand," said Neal Baer in the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," which deals with a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the congress building.
Nell Scovell, old comedy author and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he responded according to Scovell.
It is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, history coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families get to be together again and healed to the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes further beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself in the sixth hour to see a panel of experts debate Bob Woodwards use of sources with "deep background" for the book "Fear," Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of strutsar to $15,000 ("a plagg thick of arrogance," the Washington Post statement, and the impregnations of the stories.
Personally, I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Parts of what he does that make it feel like a reality program, are that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, daily leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," about the show that goes with Trump's employees and daily disputes (entering a game with NFL, praised Kim Jong-un).

He did not manage to get away, not when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Commission and the future of the Supreme Court hung in a thin thread.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows before in the time and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Floiss told.
"I thought it was a sort of joke, but it turns out that they were right."

Pens from outside currents into the densest intermediate match
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district sees an abundance of money, thanks to a transition of the districts of Congress that led to two sitting members fighting for the same seat.
The recently converted suburban district of Pittsburgh promotes Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district through a special election in spring last year.
Lamb fights another sitting member, Republican Keith Rothfus, today representative of the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, who largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
Map was redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January determined that the old districts were illegally formed to benefit the Republicans.
Competition on the 17th district has launched a ceasefire on funding of the campaigns, between the major parties' monetary arsenal, the Democratic Congress Committee and the Republican Congressional Committee.
Lamb was a known name in Pennsylvania after a button says in a closely followed special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had belonged to a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by over 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a scarce advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador due to support for China, but withdrew
Diplomats remarked that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing with no negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama to partners threw out the Trump organization's leadership group.
The State Secretarys decided to bring back the U.S. commanders of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama over the "last decided to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the Ministry's spokeswoman, in a statement early this month.
But punishment was only considered against El Salvador, who received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development, and financial support.
The purported penalties, which contained cuts to financial support and targeted restrictions in view of visas, would have been painful to the Central American country and their high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings developed, North American and Central American officials exposed a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar collection last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September the top administrators announced that they wanted the conference to continue, and therefore set a stop for the assessment of the punishment for El Salvador.
It has now been said that Vice President Mike Pence will meet the conference, which has been planned in mid-October, as a signal of the relevance administration puts on the collection, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys returned silently to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new tough messages or penalties from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton would not comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations on the assumption of anonymity.
Their description became confirmed by an outsider analyst who works closely with the administration and did not speak during the preparation of anonymity.
Studèr History
Special adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice, as there is now significant evidence for in the public protocols.
According to the reports, Mueller is reported to have turned focus on the investigation against whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia ideira attacks on our choice.
If Congress were to change the controllers, Trump will have to be directed in this body, in what he prepares to persuade voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
There is a lot of "what if", and I don't think to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable - a rather for his counterpart in Europe.
It is the choice to take for us all on both sides of the pond, which will affect how long the fight can be.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a coup against Hitler, only the West had stood against him and helped the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and missed a possibility to avoid the years of bloodbath this resulted.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and democracy's unsolicited march is accelerated or postponed.
The Americans face several of these turning points now.
What will we do if Trump kicks deputy justice minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's investigation's fate?
Rosenstein has been on deep water ever since this paper revealed that last year he proposed to intercept the president in concealment, and speculated that he is unfit for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times' writing is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or he is accepted by the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual abuse, and inexplicable testimony?
And above all, will we in the middle election vote for a congress holding Trump responsible?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're wrong, because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who became deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country I have my embassy in.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me off guard to light Sabbath lights on the table asking the Swatika.
When this is my heritage, how can I not be optimist in terms of the future?

Rangers Graham Dorans is optimistic before meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that says over Australians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a good starting point to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury hindered midfielder Graham Dorans in making his first appearance this season before 2-2 results against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a stepping board to major things.
"It was a good point for us, for Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the game with the belief that we could get something, and came out again with a point.
Perhaps we could take it at the end, but everything is probably a fair result.
They were likely better in the first half, and then we got out in the second half and were the better team.
On Thursday, it will still be a major European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough match. They got a good result in their previous match, but with the audience behind us I am sure we can run on and get a positive result.
Last year has definitely been tough, with everything that has happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but now everything is all well followed.
The stem is good and the gouts thrive; the exercise is good.
Hopefully we can run on now, put previous season behind us and be successful."
Women lose sleep on this fear of retirement
Despite the fact that participants in a survey had clear thoughts on how they would be taken care of, few were talking to family members about it.
Approximately half of those participating in an investigation from the insurance company Nationwide said they spoke to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they don't take the necessary steps to have that conversation," says Vice President of Nationwide, Holly Snyder.
Here you start.
Talk to your spouse and your kids: You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't make your wishes well-known in advance.
Collaboration with a counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, since these choices may be a large part of the firming of costs.
Get in an economic advisor: Your counselor can not help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance for care, a life insurance with cash value to help pay the expenses, or that you research yourself with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Create legal documents: Averveg legal battles before starting.
Get a health force in place, so that you designate a person you trust to have an overview of your medical treatment and to ensure that professional trades in line with your wishes in case you can't communicate.
You may not consider a warrant for your finances.
You should choose a person you trust to make financial decisions and make sure your bills are paid if you do not have the possibility yourself.
Don't forget the little details: Make sure your old parent has a medical emergency and is heading to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down all these details in a written plan, so you're ready.
"It's not just the finances it's about, but who's noble?" asked Martin.
"What kind of medication is it?
Who should take care of the dog?
Have the plan ready."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, public officials say. The number of dead is expected to increase.
Without the possibility of communicating, relief workers have not received any information from Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the quake which had a force of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi Province, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the Sulawesi Island. An estimated population in 2017 was 379 800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the quake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is an area stretching over more than 300 km with coastline to the northwest of the island.
The area, which is an administrative region lower than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200.
Fishing and farm operations are the bereebjelk of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is and important in the province, but is mostly concentrated to Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been slowed by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the disaster reduction office in Indonesia.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of houses destroyed by a tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996, the west side of the Donggala was slowed by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is steadily framed by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great tremors and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large quake on the west coast of Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on 26 December, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226 000 people along the coast of the Indian Sea, more than half of these in Aceh.
2005: A series of large quakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A quake with strength 6.8 hit south Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that crashed into the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 quake hit near the town of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A quake of magnitude 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of approximately 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A small quake hit the Pidie Jaya area in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the quake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 lost their lives due to buildings that raced.
2018: Large quake hits the Lombok tourist island and kills more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed several thousand buildings and left several thousand tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested and charged with violence in the home
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested, charged with assault.
According to a report released by the Alaska state police, Palin (29) was arrested on suspicion of violence in the home, involvement in reporting violence in the home and countering arrest.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the offences.
Palin is detained in the Mat-Su prison, and is held against bail $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court Saturday and declared himself "not guilty" when asked, raised the network.

He has also been charged with a miscarriage in Class B, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $22,000.
It is not the first time Palin has been charged with any criminal.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is up in the winter court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with attacks in the home, involvement in a reporting of violence in the home and holding a weapon while drunk in context of the incident.

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds lost their lives
At least 384 people have lost their lives after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The quake, with strength of 7.5, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed several thousand homes.
Electricity and communication networks are down, and numbers of casualties are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit right outside the central part of Sulawesi, located northeast of the capital Jakarta.
Videos showing the dramatic eyebrows where the quake hits, flares on social media.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Pau when the tsunami hit the width.
Federal prosecutors will rarely have the death penalty for suspected in New York terror
Federal prosecutors in New York will have the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been carried out for a federal offence in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) reportedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along West Side Highway on the lower Manhattan in October, where he ran down pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
In order to justify a death penalty, prosecutors must be able to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "with will" and that he "with will" imposed the serious, bodily harm, according to a note filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these events may lie to the ground for a possible death penalty, it stands in the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed a list of 22 charges, including eight charges for murder with goals of money extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in context of organized crime, and a term of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "essential planning and overlays," prosecutors said and insure the way Saipov conducted the attack as "disputable, cruel and defamable".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," it says in the note.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last Southern District in New York has sentenced the death penalty in a case.
The aim, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but ultimately became sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
Last time a death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who was hanged after being sentenced for conspiracy to commit spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both were hanged in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of regret in the days and months following, according to court documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done known well, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after seeing videos from ISIS on the phone, it says in the prosecution.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag in the hospital, police said.
He has declared himself not guilty of all charges.
David Patton, one of the federal, public defenders representing Saipov, says they are "decently disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution authority.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty, rather than accepting a declaration of guilt for life in prison without possibility of release, will only alienate trauma from the incident for all involved," Patton said.
The defenders of Saipov had previously ordered the prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Member of Parliament of Tory believes Nigel Farage should hire Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today, during a protest at the Tory convention.
The former leader of the British Armed Forces Party said that politicians had to "follow pressure" from the Euro-Politicians - by one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should hire negotiations with the EU.
Conservative, meaningful Member of Parliament Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that Britain "had been out" now, if Farage was Brexit minister.
With the challenge May faces in reconciling his deep split ranks has been underlined by a separate protest in the city, held by Tories who wish to stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister struggled to keep the plan with the Chequers commission on straight track after attacks by Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
Allied insists that she will press to get in place a deal with Brussels, despite the return - and force the Euroskeptics and Labour Party to choose between her package and "kaos".
Bone told Leave Means Leave grouping in Solihull that he wished to "throw Chequers"
He suggested Farage should have been given a noble rank and was responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had ruled, we would be out now," he said.
Parliamentary member from Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject Chequers".
To mark his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be subordinate.
We will make our own laws in our own country".
Bone refuses the claim that the meaning of the people has changed since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British people have changed meaning and wish to become is completely false".
Brexit fighters from Tory, Andrea Jenkyns, also participated in the march. She told the reporters: "I say only: Prime Minister, hear the people!"
"Chequers are not popular in the population, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not popular in our party or our activists as free women streets and get us selected initially.
Please, drop Chequers and listen."
In a message directed against May, she adds: "State ministers keep their jobs when they hold what they promise".
Farage said police officers must get "knowing the heat" if they would come to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that "We're not going to let them get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want to dive to get the political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to know the heat.
"We mobilize the population army of this country that gave us a say in Brexit and should not rest until we have become an independent, self-governed, proud UK.
At the same time, Remainers marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the center.
A handful of activists winged with "Tories Against Brexit" banner after launching the group this weekend.
Labour-cooled Lord Adonis made fun of the conservatives for security problems they had with a party app during the opening of the conference.
"This is the human being who tells us that they can have all computer systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for a frictionless border, for free trade without limits in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total father.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders say over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the eye-opening Valtteri Battas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the team orders from Mercedes came to have a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start on the race, and let Hamilton take care of himself in what he defended his position the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack the teammate.
Vettel was first into the depot and allowed Hamilton to enter the traffic behind the road, which should be crucial.
The Mercedes ran into the depot a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton ported in front of a little action side-about page that left Ferrari driver againstvilleg had to leave the inside in danger of not being able to defend themselves at the third corner.

The team has done an exceptional job that has both first and second," Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein on an election meeting Saturday due to her insistence that she did not leave the letter from Christine Blasey Ford where she charges the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh for sexual assault.
During a speech at an election meeting in West Virginia, the President did not mention the testimony Ford had given the Senate Commission directly, but rather commented that what goes on in the Senate showed that people were "simple and awful and spoke untrue".
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and fragile and unpleasant and speak untrue," he said.
"When you look at publications and leaks and then say, 'Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you think you're diving?
Diane Feinstein, did you see that?
Remember her answer... do you leave the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't let it."
Wait an eyebrow.
Lak me... No, we didn't let it," he added, while imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh of Ford in July, and it became play earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak coming from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't let her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked for."
But her refusal did not fall in good soil with the president, commenting on Saturday's election meeting: "I say dive, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been charged with poor sexual behavior by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used the charges for their own gain.
"They are determined to take back power in every way they see necessary.
You see the muzzle, the trap, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to gain power and control," said the president according to Mediaite.

Flight leader loses life to ensure that hundreds of people in planes escape earthquakes
A plane leader in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he lost his life in what he continues to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers recovered safely in the air.
More than 800 people have lost their lives and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks continue to disrupt the area, and there are many trapped in debris in the town of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues fleeing for life, Anthonius Gunawan Agung (21) refused to resign from his post in the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Pau, although it fluctuated wildly.
He again became sure that the plane that stood on the runway, Batik Air Flight 6321, took off safely.
He then jumped down from the control tower when he believed it collapsed.
He later died in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan to bring him to a major hospital in a major city.
Unfortunately, he went away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is heartbreaking," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are afraid of a number of casualties will increase to thousands, while the country's emergency relief agency says access to the small towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of dead increases while we find bodies trapped under buildings. Many of them we cannot reach," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six metres have destroyed Palu, which is to hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Naud Help comes in with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Wart minute comes an ambulance with several bodies.
It is difficult to find clean water.
Small stores have become rabble."
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find when they arrive.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the military in the country: "I ask you to dive everyone to work around the clock to do everything they can to help with the evacuation.
Are they ready?” reported CNN.
Indonesia was earlier this year hit by earthquakes in Lombok, and 550 people died.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports man missing after team plane crash
The airline operating a plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific reports that a man is missing, having stated earlier that all 47 of the passengers and crew became safely evacuated from the plane before it sank.
Air Niugini stated that as of Saturday afternoon, they do not know where the male passenger is.
The airline said they are working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the man.
The airline gave no more details about the passenger, and his age and nationality are unknown.
Local boat owners helped save other passengers and crew after the plane slowed the water when it attempted to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Authorities stated on Friday that seven people have been sent to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
It is still unknown what caused the crash and what actually her.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the aircraft landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Someone testified that the plane flew past the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"It was extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes added that he and other passengers were able to sweep through the water, which raked them up to their lives, to the naut exits on the plane before it sank.
He said the flight crew had panic and peel, and he suffered a head injury that was not serious.
The U.S. Navy said that seals nearby, who were working to improve a berth, also rescued passengers with a rubber boat that they used to carry passengers to land before the aircraft sank at about 30 metres.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network website shows that 111 people have died in crashes by PNG registered airlines' aircraft over the past 20 years, but none of them flew with Air Niugini.
Analysts make timeline overnight when woman became brend alive
The prosecution presented all evidence on Saturday during the appealed trial for a man charged with burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice's analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He portrayed the jury how he put together recordings from cell phones to find out what her night when Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the defendant, Quinton Tellis (29).
Following the paper The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett told him that he used localization data from several cell phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, as opposed to what Tellis explained earlier.
When the location data showed that Tellis' cell phone was with Chambers' mobile at the same time as he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
When the prosecution asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he "laug, because my car was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
But their cell phone bills showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that for a while after Chambers died, Tellis deleted messages, calls, and Chambers' contact information from their mobile phone.
"He deleted her from his life," Hale said.
The defense shall end the case on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to go to the jury later that day.

Another black person?!
Child passports in New York sue couple for kick after "racist" text message
A New York child passport sues a couple to give her fired based on discrimination after she received an incorrect text message from her mother stating that she was "a black person."
The couple has denied that they are racist, comparing the case with "expression."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, was unhappy when she saw that the child passer she had added, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at work for the first time in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEI, ENDA EIN SART PERSON," wrote Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to the children's passport Maurice, twice.
After inserting her mistake, the inappropriate Plasco-Flaxman gave child passport Maurice fired, saying that the previous child passer, who was African-American, had done a bad job, so now she would have someone from the Philippines, according to The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day work before sending her home in a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple to get compensation for giving her fired. She wants $350 per day for six months for her job she would have had, even though it was without a contract, where she would live with her family.
"I want to show them that it's not okay to do this," she told The New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple has denied that they are racists, saying that giving Maurice fired was the only thing they could do after insulting her, of which they were afraid that she would take revenge.
"My wife had sent something to her that she didn't intend to say.
She is not a racist.
We are not racists," said husband Joel Plasco to The New York Post.
"But would you let someone you've offended your children, even if you didn't mean to offend them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "expression," saying his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you really going to take action on a person in such a situation?
It's not a nice thing to do," said investor Plasco.
As the case precedes, the public has been quick to judge the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
The publisher behind the Paddington books was afraid that people would not like a talking bear, reveals new letters
The daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the approval of the first book, commented: "It's hard to see how it was to read the book for the first time, before it was published.
It is very fun to know now how successful Paddington became."
Jankel said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about the small teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected. She added that she had mixed feelings during the book's 60th anniversary, because her father died last year.
As for Paddington, which she described as "a very important member of the family," she added that her father was proud of the inside of how great success he did.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he never screamed," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having children who achieved something: you're proud of them even if it's not really you that's behind.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creature and imagination, he always gave all praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter would die and I had to say goodbye to the phone
When she landed, her daughter was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice in all the hurry, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say it was really bad, that they didn't believe she was going to do it," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called to say she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did that.
I said, "Tashi, I'm so happy with you, dear you.
I'm coming soon to be with you.
I'll be soon.
Medical doctors had given her that her heart would continue pumping was slowly heading out of her system.
She had already died and now the body was turning off.
I just sat there, knowing this happened.
I couldn't school or scream, because I was in a room surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep everything inside."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now south over the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane along with other passengers who did not know what she had just gone through.
"No one knew anything," she said.
"I sat with my head bent while tears fall."
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I knew how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how happy he was."
Safe women hang patches on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones who committed suicide attempt to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have attached patches on a bridge in Wales that are to inspire and make people thinking to kill suicide to vote and call the numbers on the note.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began struggling with depression and killed his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I know me every day."
Davis, aged 45 and living in Lydney, said her son was a talented cook with a smile that infected.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They said his smile was shining up all rooms."
But before his death he quit work, for he was in a "real dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was the first to find Tyler after he had taken his own life.
Davis said: "I'm still worried that the little brother may have been affected by Tyler's death."
Davis wrote the note "for people to know that there are other people out there who care and who they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit there alone - you need to talk to someone."
Humphreys, who has been Davis' friend for many years, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mother.
"He never told me he was bored or depressed or any thing," she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noted that he began to behave differently.
He was in the basement emotionally on Christmas Day, when the children opened their puzzles did not see him on the one-time."
She told us that his death was very traumatic to the children, and they continue to work through the trauma: "It's a large void in our family now.
We're completely destroyed.
But we all have to fight to live on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts the investigation
"I thought that if we actually got something similar to what he asks about - a limited investigation - then maybe we could achieve some unity," said Flake on Saturday, adding that he is afraid the committee "commonly together" in the middle of a partysanar backlock.
Why wouldn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They hesitate because of the timing.
The middle elections in the United States are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans do not do well, this will make it difficult for them to choose Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called senators to make them support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley in that way, then the secretary of Bush.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
They are going to run in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh manages to gather at least 50 runs in the Senate. With 50 runs Mike Pense, the vice president of the United States, can give him the last voice and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors in North Korea "turns down" under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has gone down since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, reports a South Korean lawmaker
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korean Ministry of Unit, saying there were 1127 defectors last year — compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter boundaries between North Korea and China and more expensive smugglers fees are the main reasons why the number has declined.
Pyongyang has not stated publicly.
The vast majority of North Korea's defectors receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China looks at defectors as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, often sending them back with coercion.
Relations between North and South Korea - which purely technically are still in war - have improved in recent months.
This month the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the disarmament of nuclear weapons.
These conversations come after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they became agreeable to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean foreign minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of not achieving anything since then.
"Without being able to trust the United States, we can't rely on our country being safe, and in such a situation we can't downgrade our weapons first," said Ri in a speech in the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric," saying he can't serve in the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court, "hysteric" and said he has too much temper to serve in the U.S. Supreme Court.
Pelosi called Kavanaugh "hysteric" in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I know if a woman had behaved in that way, she had been called "hysteric,"" said Pelosi on the testimony of Kavanaugh in front of the Senate judge's chair on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and denied all charges that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In Kavanaugh's opening speech, he was very emotional and yelled at times with lump in his throat while telling about his family and years on further.
He criticized the Democrats of the committee, calling the charges against him "grothesk and a planned assassination of his reputation," organized by liberal police officers who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court, because it shows that he is prejudiced against Democrats.
"I think the way he behaved on disqualifies him, and what he said about the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi made a objection when she was asked whether she would try to get Kavanaugh to resign if elected to the Supreme Court, and if the Democrats achieve majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this - if he doesn't tell the truth of Congress or the FBI, he can't serve in the Supreme Court, nor in court he serves now," Pelosi added.
Kavanaugh is a judge in Washington D.C.'s federal Court of Appeal.
Pelosi also said that as a Democrat, she is concerned about potential judges from Kavanaugh against the law known as Obamacare and the case about Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm Kavanaugh, he avoided answering questions if he came to turn certain decisions into the Supreme Court.
"It's not the right time for a hysterical, prejudiced person in the Supreme Court who expects us to say he's great," said Pelosi.
And women have to swing the sword.
It is a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of rage, and it does not get it out without crying.
"We cried when we're angry," Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you think?"
She continues, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high firm position, who said she branched when she was angry, but developed a technique where she said to the person who made her so angry that she branch, "You think I'm sorry because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just continues.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears act as a way to get out of your mind, but there are many who misunderstand.
In one of my strongest memories from a previous job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I branched out of anger, and a woman who was older than me took me in the neck - she was a cold leader whom I had always been terrified of - and went out at a time.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're tired of you and that they won because they made you cry."
Patricia Schroeder, who was at the time a congresswoman, a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, Hart was taken on a boat called Monkey Business, and resigned from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought she could as well run for president himself.
"I had not really thought through it well enough," she told me while she laughed, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates running for election, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation "Snow white and the seven dwarfs."
Since the campaign had already preceded for a while, it had not collected enough money, so she promised that she would only run if she managed to collect $2 million.
It was impossible.
She discovered that her supporters who gave $1000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she asked.
When she declared that she was not going to run for election anyway, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and aim for the riders instead of the delegates, and anger against gender discrimination, that she began crying during the speech.
"You would think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said about how the press reacted when she branch.
"You should think Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my tombstone?
"Ho article?"
How the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
Opening halls in the trade war between the United States and China were run-off, and while the battle continues, a rift between the two countries can be an advantage for Beijing on a long-time basis, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump shot first shot this year taxing important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The battle escalated this week, with tariffs on articles worth over $200 billion, which in effect means that half of all goods from China to the United States will be taxed.
Beijing has taken home and set tariffs of between five and ten percent on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to answer the United States for each shot they fire off, and the second largest economy in the world is most likely not to go under with the first.
To make Washington stop, China needs to do what the United States wants, but to succumb to the United States is too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
Yet, experts say that if Beijing holds the head cold, the U.S. pressure can have a positive effect on Chinese economy in the long term, by decreasing the degree of dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can cause both economies to go under is more dangerous than people have dared to admit earlier," said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says they are ready to accept refugees who will return voluntarily, asking for help to rebuild the country that is destroyed after more than seven years in war.
When he spoke to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mooualem said that the conditions in the country are making progress.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terror," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to regain normal areas.
All assumptions are now in place for refugees to be able to return voluntarily to the country they had to travel from due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that went beyond the daily life and livelihood.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war started in 2011.
Additional six million people in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would like to take on aid to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that they are not going to accept assistance or help with conditions from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe says in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup when they defeated the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 in the Le Golf National off Paris, France.
The United States has now lost on European soil six times in a row, and they have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown of that team to the Danish captain, Thomas Bjørn, reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson suffered most of the tournament. He hit the ball in the water from the tea at holes 16, par 3, and thus gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari did well in all his rounds and became one of four players that someone's mind has received 5-0-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5&4 by the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's highest rank, became 2 and 1 after English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has split into eight Ryder Cups, became the most winning European with 25.5 points in the career.
"Of course I didn't cry, but today I can't help it.
It has been a tough year.
So grateful that Thomas opted me and believes in me.
I'm so, so happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European says.
He makes the relay stick on to the landman John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in single play on Sunday.
"I know a huge pride in defeating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him," said Rahm (23).
Woods lost all four of his matches in France, and now has a 13-21-3 I Ryder Cup record through the careers.
A remarkable statistics from one of the world's best players, who have won 14 major titles and are only defeated by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled to find the fairway all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who impressed with golf at high levels throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, the American captain, stated after a disappointing show from his team. "I'm proud of these boys, they fought.
It was periods this morning where we made it hot for Europe.
We sloss.
Hat of Thomas.
He is a one-off captain
All 12 players played very well.
