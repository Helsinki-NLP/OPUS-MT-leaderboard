Biden leads the polls in three key positions
When there are only 100 days to vote, Joe Biden, the leader of the Democratic Party, is pre-elected in three important rivers.
CNN reports that Biden was in Florida, Arizona and Michigan.
Biden, with 51% follow up to 46% follow the president.
In Arizona, the site is 49%-45% Biden in the wild, and Michigan is heading to the Biden, where it leads by 12 points, 52%-40%.
To win in November, after 100 days, Trump needs to turn all these states into, and actually more.
Trump sits on this day with a coronavirus epidemic that the countryers teach him in addition to recommending and saying long-runners of the state have failed, or very badly at the beginning of the epidemic.
In addition, Trump has failed to escape the protests and the insurgents that launched George Floyd's death.
Trump and his government have abused or wronged them.
In order to defeat Trump, he is now under a serious criticism of having organized federal police officers to break behind protests in cities where citizens or governments are Democrats.
It has created a huge wolf spray among the inhabitants of the city, and the anger spread over to other Americans.
The images of the federal police officers that are attacking protesters in unmarked cars have not helped the U.S. case.
The Lincoln Project is really interested in this, but it can be seen below.
Trump won all three states in 2016, but with very little vote.
Trump won very many states with small votes and won the elections with minor votes.
Michigan, for example, won it by only 10,704 votes.
It is less than 0.5% of the population.
Close to all the polls that politicians say significant are showing the same outcome, Biden is taken out.
A new survey by CNN in Arizona shows that Biden is now out of the survey.
The same could be said of CNN and the Quinnipiac University of Florida.
More to say Fox News, who leans well to the right and described Trump’s support in 2016, has published the same content in their tickets.
The last hope of the president, according to the results of the question, is that Trump may have a hope of re-election of important places within the Arctic if attention to the election process is directed to the economy.
The economy of the United States took a heavy hit following the Covid-19 epidemic, but voters do not seem to connect the economic crisis with the coronavirus epidemic.
That is to say, the vast majority of voters seem to blame Trump for failing to react to the coronavirus age, but trust him better in dealing with the economic impact of the state.
However, Trump has failed to control the debate in the election.
Following the insurgents who have been almost isolated from the news, the video was accidentally revealed by four police officers killed George Floyd, Trump tried to control the discussion of law enforcement and its importance.
Law and Order, his words became.
Now it seems to have failed completely, as I said earlier.
As the polls lean more on Trump, more and more Republicans are more likely to understand Trump and inform him of the support of various Biden, or anyone else, who is then Biden without mentioning him specifically on his name.
They do this because of the arrangement in the United States to vote in many elections on the same election.
This can simply be marked by the other party in the presidential election, and it shall be valid as a vote for all other candidates of the general election.
Thus, the Republican Party’s leaders tried to dissipate themselves from the relaxation of Trump and achieve self-defence in elections.
The Olympic Games in Dakar suspended until 2026
The Olympics of youth were scheduled to take place in Dakar next year, but they have now been postponed to 2026 due to the coronavirus epidemic after the International Olympic Committee and Senegal agreed to make an agreement on it.
The first Olympic Games to take place in Africa, however, is the case for many young athletes.
Volunteers arrested for browns in Nantes
Volunteers in Nantes, France, have been arrested in connection with a fire that destroyed the church.
Le Monde, after the plaintiff that the suspect, a fugitive from Rwanda who worked as an overseer in the church, has acknowledged that he has burned the fire.
The man’s lawyer said in a conversation with another media officer that the man was a big suspect after his actions.
Among the ruins of the fire were the organ of the 17th century and the historically illustrated windows of the church.
The volunteer who is 39 years old, but has not been named, was arrested shortly after the brown on 18 July last year, but was so released.
He was then jailed again for a report yesterday and rushed to custody after the incident.
“No way out of this.”
Well received me at the home of Baltasar and Kristjörna Samper in Kópavogi.
A new exhibition of Baltasar and his daughter, Mireyu, which will be opened on August 1st in Litla-Kambi on Snæfellsnes.
This is the first time the family shows up.
I was brought down to the work room of Baltasars, where a great deal of work has been done with me.
Large and bold images of the kittens in the past but also of flying vers; the eagle on one, shadowing birds on one another.
From the workplace, it is available in the garden of the home.
“We had a horse here with us that we were running the grass,” Baltassar said.
“The horse works much better than the lawn on this floor and the heights we have.”
Mireya is with us Kristjö and Baltasar, and she tells us how her work is about the works that are here.
"Instructions, intermixing paperwork and sceptical design.
They’re all very white and in contrast to what my dad is doing, where I’m working with the light and that way,” she says.
“It’s been a year since this idea came up.
There was a certain work I was working on and wanted to show there, but they were stuck in Tokyo out of Covid.
When my dad started painting and I saw where he was going I rethinked my party," says Mireya, but Baltasar's work has a strong baptism in Icelandic folk tales about women's hunger and violence.
“When I saw my dad doing this painting with the stickers, I felt the ability to make a harm related to them,” says Mireya, but she works with Sigurðurður No Bjarnasyn’s gold box in Sign’s store.
“I’m going to make a statement from the crash.”
In the last year, Mireya attended the exhibition 72 artists of the Akademia detector at Snæfellsnesi, including in Litla-Kambi and found the building charming.
“This is a new space, an old battery that is newly built,” says Mireya, but she talked to Baldvuna Sverrisdóttir’s art scholar, who stood up for Mireya and Baltasar to set up a show together.
“She wanted us both to show and then we thought:
“Why not?
That’s a good idea.”
Baltasar Samper was born in 1938 in Spain and studied at the University of Barcelona before he held a World Heritage Site to present his art collections and lectures.
He came here in Iceland in 1961 and was filled with land and nation.
Soon afterwards, he met his wife, Kristjön, and has lived here since 1963, for 57 years.
Baltasar is a remarkable artist, has kept the tug private show, and shows with Kristjörna wide.
He is known for his large walls, including a wall painting in the Flat Island Church and a fresco in the Church of St. Paul.
“What affects what I do is the bit that Iceland has and no other place,” Baltasar said.
“This low sun and those shadows that stretch and stretch.
As soon as I came here, I thought, “Well, here you can work.”
Mireya is the oldest child of Kristján and Baltasars, born in 1964.
“There was one thing I knew, it was absolutely clear that I didn’t want to be a photographer,” she said.
“I went to a university and a university school and did everything I could to get out of it.
I realized that I was in a hurry.
“You just have to give up,” says Mireya and laugh.
She has, like her father, shown her way around the world.
Much in Japan, to form.
All the children of Baltasar and Kristjörna have fed the listway.
"I call it a virus," Mireya said.
“There was no way out of this.”
Telur Icelandair has been in a grey area when the aircraft was released
The Minister of Social Affairs believes Icelandair has been in a grey area when the company gave up all flights in the middle of the chain.
He said that the laws that mean the firefighters to enter the apartment building will be taken into account after the brown on Brørnborg’s trail.
On 17 July Icelandair said that all 38 airliners who worked with the company were still on the board of the airline.
The members of the board were aware of whether Icelandair was able to handle these issues and were prepared to resolve the issue before the Court of Justice.
However, there was never a single flight flight flight and Icelandair gathered for about 24 hours after the announcements.
On the other hand, the Minister of Social Affairs says that in his mind the decision of Icelandair was in a grey area and went to the right wagers.
“My opinion is that it’s a certain right to defend employees.
When you’re in trouble, when you’re in agreement, there’s no choice to go this way.
It is clear in my mind that this would not happen.
“I think it’s clear, in my mind, that men came into a crying area where this touched,” says Ásmundur.
He won’t speak for other companies to go the same way as Icelandair.
“It’s also a dangerous discussion that it’s just normal to get this system up to reduce this right and that’s why I’m totally opposed.”
During Sprengidur this morning, Ásmundur was also asked about the reaction of the government at the brown of the Brewery at the end of June, where the thirteenth allowed life.
The Secretary of State said the investigation is now on the table of Housing and Human Resources, which he has directly submitted.
“It’s in the law today that the fire can’t go into the apartment.
I have asked the Housing and Human Resources Agency to examine, in particular, whether there is a reason to go into some legal changes.
“I’m ready to come up with the changes that need to reduce bodies so that can happen again,” says Ásmundur Einar.
You can listen to the interview with Ásmund as a whole in the game below.
U.S. shooting increased pressure on North Stream 2 - RT Business News
The U.S. government has made further attempts to force European companies to claim the Nord Stream 2, which is led by Russia, according to Welt am Sonntag, who quotes to people who are familiar with the matter.
According to the newspaper, officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance and the U.S. Department of Energy have contacted the European Commission to ensure that they are aware of the consequences of continuing the project.
All 12 officials must have held at least two online meetings with representatives of companies in the past few days.
Those who witnessed the discussion said that the Americans had “wine” music stressed that the United States wanted to prevent North Stream 2 from being a reality.
"I think it's very, very serious," one of the German media said.
In accordance with the comments by Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State, last week, he warned that companies involved in the project would be best to “come out now” or have a risk of punishment under 232 parts of the aldermous laws of Coating America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
In addition to the Russian energy crisis Gazprom, which manages the development of the project, five European companies take part in it.
This is the French company Engie, OMV from Austria, the British-Hutch company Royal Dutch Shell as well as Wintershall and Uniper from Germany.
In a conversation with Welt am Sonntag, a representative of the latter company said that the United States attempts to exhume “a significant infrastructure” would be clearly involved in the European Union.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Congress approved a change in the law on land defences intended to expose US sanctions against companies involved in the installation of the Russian North Stream 2 gas pipeline.
According to one carrier of the law enforcement network, it is possible that companies that pay for or submit ships, security, portability or connection services for such ships, as well as those offering certification for Nord Stream 2.
Both European companies and public officials have repeatedly described their objection to the United States to exchange European energy by applying penalties against North Stream 2, and have some of them even named after Brussels's vice-presidential action.
The leaders of Moscow have also criticised the action of Washington, and called it unfair competition.
Earlier this week, President Dmitry Peskov said Russia would set up a new plan on how the project will be completed if Washington officials keep new sanctions to the stress.
Further transport of public institutions into a country
The Minister of Social Affairs and Children’s Affairs is planning to move more public institutions into the country in the next few years.
The Brunaviðar field of Housing and Human Resources will be moved north of the Sahara river in autumn to decide the minister’s decision, but experts before the division have previously declared that they do not intend to move northwards.
Ásmundur Einar Daðson, Minister of Social Affairs and Child Affairs, said in Sprengisandi at Byljugur this morning that it was important for the country’s residents to submit to public institutions.
Therefore, there is a huge value purchase that will also damage diversity.
“It’s very important, we’re trying to build it all around the country.
“Working construction, profitable construction, whether in tourism, agriculture, industry, some natural engineering and this type of work that public jobs are supporting very well for those construction,” says Ásmundur.
“Creates increased diversity, creates better stands under this resource utilization and currency acquisition of the nation.”
The decision of Ásmundur to transfer the greenhouse and human resources sector has been critically criticized by its employees and the Landsconnection of firearms and ambulances.
Six men who live in a field of fire and work in the department are all living in the capital area, and none of them is going to transfer their cages to the Saádárkóks.
“I think it’s clear that there’s a political difference in how hard it’s going to happen.
“My opinion is, and has always been, that we should be in radical action to spread the public jobs better,” says Ásmundur.
“We see that our neighbours, Norwegians and Danes have been doing this successfully.”
He is convinced that the vast majority of the people want to see more distribution in the public institutions around the country.
“I think it needs to take more political decisions on the transfer of public works on land, as I was doing with the Housing and Human Services Agency.”
He is an example of the transport of Food Institutes in Selfoss, Landstation Iceland to Akranes and Insecurity Insurance on Skagast Coast.
“It’s a workplace on the Skagast Beach today that matters a lot to that community.
I think we’re going to step further in this world.”
“I’m preparing for a further step in this world.
More transport."
Five arrests in Seattle
Federal racism and the decision of the U.S. House of Representatives to send the municipalities of the federal police in cities to shout down the uninhabited were protested yesterday.
Fifteen protesters were arrested in Seattle.

21 police officers were arrested and at least 45 protesters were arrested.
Two months ago, protests against systemic racism began in the United States after police officer George Floyd died.
The blues were for the protests to show protesters in Portland.

He had a miracle child 47 years old.
The Kenya Moore reality star makes it a great way to strengthen people who need technology innovation.
Moore, known for her participation in the Real Housewives of Atlanta, had her first child 47 years after the technology revolution and calls her daughter the miracle child.
“Give me almost all my life after having a baby,” Moore told People.
“So I know the situation that people find, especially women, that I might not have a child.”
Moore realized that she was running out of time when she got caught.
“I didn’t want to have a baby alone.
I didn’t want to be a single mother.
So I waited and after a while, I looked up and thought of my god," said Moore, who did not meet his child's father until she was 46 years old.
One year later, they had a daughter.
The reality star tells her daughter to be a miracle child in more than one way.
In addition to what Moore was older than most of her originals, her daughter came into the world one and a half months ago.
Moore went to Caesar's court which proved difficult and took longer than the traditional emperor's court.
“I called her a miracle because this was a child that everyone said was almost no chance for me to have,” Moore said in the interview.

Gottlieb warns that the virus virus spread in society makes it “very difficult” for schools to open up in the autumn
Washington — Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former Chief of Food and Drug Control, warned on Sunday that it would be “very difficult” for school districts to open up on a new course of study if the coroner spreads out in the face of these communities.
“I think the school authorities need to look at how the distribution is within the community.
If the hunt spreads in the community, it will be very difficult to open up in that situation,” Gottlieb said in “Face the Nation”.
Since the autumn should begin in the next few weeks, the government of Trump had encouraged the school authorities to open their school for students and offer classes in schools for five days a week.
However, this attempt by President Trump and the Secretary of State Betsy DeVos came a week after Trump warned that the coronavirus epidemic would probably “change before he recovers” and confirmed that school districts in those places where the situation is worst may have to delay the opening of school for a few weeks.
However, medical centers gave instructions on Thursday about how safe it would be to open school for students.
In the instructions, among other things, it is known that in schools distances between people are guaranteed, students and staff are advised to use face responses and that students are divided into selected groups to reduce infection.
However, the medical centre did not give out the criteria for school administrators when they should close schools if the coronovirus counts are increasing, which Gottlieb says has been "good".
“When this uncertainty state and accurate guidance has not been given to how schools will be opened, I think more parents will be careful,” he said.
“That’s why I think very important to get accurate information about the accuracy of each measurement is exactly what the medical centre didn’t provide in its instructions.”
Gottlieb said school districts need to think about the proportion of positive infections in the community, local spreads and test scores when decisions are made about whether to keep schools open or exchange the alpha into online teaching.
If between 5 to 10% analysis a positive result - the question of watering over 10% is "the threshold when considering carefully whether or not the school should be closed."
"This is a sign that the farm has reached a foothold in the community," Gottlieb said, adding that this would make parts of Florida, which is the Korean virus epidemic in the United States, difficult to open for teaching schools in the next month.
The virus epidemics have increased in more than 30 states and the Colombian provinces, but the North Korean population is so called to the south coast of the United States.
Gottlieb said that the sign was that it was starting to slow down the growth in some states, including Arizona and Texas.
But despite the fact that Gottlieb had said that it was “a distinct sign” that it was going to slow down the ages of some states in the Solar Belt is going to “heat in the coals” in others, including South Carolina, Alabama, India, and Illinois.
Many governments have set rules that blame people to use monsters in public spaces and to stop the capture of re-opening to track the spread of the coronavirus.
Gottlieb said that the state should consider closing the bars, limiting the number of people in restaurants, closing cinemas and other places that offer entertainment in the interiors, and putting rules on the use of mortars to overcome the dangers of the danger in March.
In addition to that which various states have made abuses, some companies have accused people of using face-to-face answers.
McDonald’s is the newest company to make use of the face-to-face defenses and suppressed it in groups such as Walmart, Starbucks and more that have seen their own rules of abuse.
Gottlieb said that he expected more companies to take up a huge amount of money, especially where the risk is considered high.
“If we can really have control over the ages when the winter goes into a garden until we get a vaccine or some kind of treatment that changes the clinical process of this disease, then we can do it with masks, it’s relatively simple, something we can all do but that doesn’t change our direct lives and allows us to keep what’s very important for us, like keeping some businesses up and coming back to school,” he says.
Despite Donald Trump’s last week’s not saying that the U.S. government would not allow Americans to use face-to-face responses and said in the White House’s press conference that “it would have had an impact.”
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson: “It’s time to expect.”
The members of Crystal Palace were granted a notice for the summer, Roy Hodgson, the CEO of the company, declared it over the applicant's cousin Wilf Zaha wanted to leave the company.
The coach has played at Selhurst Park for more than five years and now seems to be on the go, but he has been previously featured on the team at Arsenal and Bayern Munich.
Since he is now 27 years old after he turns out whether a team in that class is still willing to pay a high sum for him, especially on financial uncertainty in the sport this summer, after the period where Zaha scored four goals and made five standings for the Palace team that caused some disappointment.
In an interview with Alex Crook at TalkSport after the last game of the season, Hodgson said that “the past would be expected” in terms of possible crimes by Zaha after confirming that the applicant had “commissioned to see his future elsewhere than with the club.
But three years after the contract of the applicant at Palace, and last year the company announced that 100 million sterling dollars would require the club to keep him from hand.
The song Hodgson finished the season with seven laps in a row and a tie on the last day of the season, which became the team fell into the 14th place.
Zaha found the net meshes only once from mid-December to the end of the season with a long shot in a loss against Chelsea.
It was reported that he had asked for the sale last summer, he was trying to get rid of the club, but no offer was offered to try Palace to sell.
Zaha changed his agent in January, that it seems to increase the chances of leaving the company, and in the next few weeks it will be without doubt in the course of his retirement.
Zaha is the player who played most minutes in the English Premier League for the Palace during the season and was the only player of the team younger than 28 years who played 1100 minutes or more, showing how much rebuilding the team could be necessary to manage the funds received for the player.
The virus virus free Texas states are facing a high risk of a “low crack”
Weather officials have predicted “hamfarts” in the south of Texas after the filibly Hanna was hit twice in the country and had a huge rain and wind force of up to 40 meters per second.
When he reached the beach on Saturday, he was classed as the first stage storm (last level of five ladders scale) and he has now been brought down into the hot tub, but rain could still reach the numeral 150-300 mm on Sunday and windows could reach 26 meters per second.
In some areas, rain has already reached up to 230 mm, including in Cameron County, Mexico.
Hanna was the first filibly filibly filibly season in the Atlantic Ocean in 2020 and weather scientist Chris Birchfield advised to be well at the price: “This is not close to the end. We still have hope of the disaster.”
In the last few weeks, Texas has suffered a huge increase in coronavirus counts.
Governor Greg Abbott released a battle announcement for 23 horrors that will be on the way to the storm, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston, and Brazoria.
“All of these lobbies are a huge challenge.
This challenge is complex and even more difficult as the filibly is going through a region that has become the worst outside of COVID-19," Greg said.
The filibly came first to land at 17:00 on Saturday, 24 miles north of Port Mansfield, which is about 210 kilometers south of Corpus Christi.
The second time was not far from the east of Kennedy County.
More than 43,700 people in South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Brownsville, were without electricity on Saturday night.
Corpus Christi’s Emergency Services set up a garden close to street interfaces to be able to use them if the floods will cross the streets.
President Donald Trump said that the government was monitoring the design and error of Douglas, who was heading towards Havai in the Pacific Ocean.
Sherry Boehme, who lives on the beach in Corpus Christi, said that the storm approaching had increased the anxiety that she found for the world's catastrophe.
This 67-year-old woman had mostly stayed at home due to health problems associated with chronic pulmonary disease.
She said, “It’s almost like a double wall for us.
I think a lot of people are ignorant.
We'll get through this.
They are all good and strong and stand together.”
A windy sailing boat in South America
In the South, the island has gone unusually well this summer, but the weather has grown to be profitable.
Most of them have first bats, another bull is widely commenced, and it is estimated that some third-quarters are reaching the end of the summer.
The weather has played with the Icelandic farmers, such as the other inhabitants of the country in the summer and not the source of the prayer.
Heyness has worked well.
Sigurður Águstsson, a ball player in Birtingaholt in Hrunnamannhreppi and works in hearing are happy and happy.
“Yes, it’s just been very good, I think the farmers just have to be good, it’s been going fine yet to be a very good weather last month.
Heyin is very good yet the harvester is good and the quality of the hearing is fine all over,” says Sigurd.
Sigurd says that it moves into growth, not least in the bubble that they hear in flat-grey or outdoor conditions, which have been given very well, but it’s far the most to do in roulette.
“It’s life-threatening, yes, it’s actually been very comfortable right now for the last half month or three weeks, it’s been so dry and good and it’s so comfortable to have this.
It will remember everything, it’s less stress and can be stored for morning sometimes what could be done today, so it’s incredibly convenient.
Do you think that some farmers will strike three times?
“Yes, I could believe what was first.
We started on June 17th, it could be that those who were first have to take three times.”
An amazing solution to the wolves - this is how they prevent injuries
The man Adama Traoré, who plays with Wolves in the English division, is a huge speed player.
His contradictions have it to grab him to make sure he doesn’t get through them.
This has caused his shoulder to die several times from a team, but now the wolves have solved the problem.
The Sun reports this.
In the game Wolves v. Crystal Palace, a nurse could dig something on the shoulders of the Traoré.
“It’s something we had to do to protect Traoré,” said a teacher within Wolves, but what was being carried out on him was children’s oil.
“To make him a thief makes defenders more difficult for him and so we can prevent further injuries.”
His coach Traoré first fell from a team when Wolves played against Tottenham in December.
Since then, the shoulder has fallen from a team four times, now the last time against Sheffield United this month.
News of Harry England's Prince of England: Win the Duke of Sussex protests in a new book that has been between the dentists of the people
Stott said in a conversation with Sky News that the content of Harry Prince and Meghan Markle's book was in no way different from the material of the newspaper, the only difference would be that the book was locked up.
The former man wishes to see the vision directly that the positives that the couple have put on the dark, such as their good work.
Stott said: “I think what’s going on in nothing different from what we read in the newspapers, except just now in the inner book.”
“It’s a story that says, but there’s nothing to be said about it.”
“I think it’s just one attack on them, just like the gossip of them.”
“I realize they’re in the spotlight and people want to know what they’re doing, but I wanted it to be more about all the good things they’ve done and their good work, rather than their personal issues.”
“You never get rid of it, because of it.”
The support of the Duke of Sussex and the Duchess of Sussex shrunk on the other members of the royal family, because it has been after experts in the history of the royal family.
Doctor Kate Williams told Sky News that the royal family had not managed to make use of the stars of Harry Prince and Meghan Markle in his then.
She added that within the royal family the electors were fixed, but it was not possible to control the importance of public interest.
She also said: “The fact is that all that they did to the Queen’s support had a tendency to draw attention to other members of the royal family, and this was the opinion of a problem.”
“They are very popular.”
“They had less weddings than most siblings in the same position, Andrew had a huge wedding, Anne also had a huge wedding.”
“But while Harry and Meghan were smaller in formats than in Vilhjál and Katrin, news transmission was as important, because of the great interest of the world’s population in the couple.”
Donald Trump admits he sees him often after his argument on Twitter.
Donald Trump has acknowledged that he sees him often after his post on Twitter as a rapper for the rest of his life.
In an interview with Barstool Sports on Friday, U.S. President Barstool Sports said that his untrustworthy re-imbursement on Twitter records — which some of them have contained material from white racism — sparked him in the most trouble.
Dave Portnoy asked him if he saw him in his post, Trump replied: “Of course, too often.
It was so in the old days, before this came, that you wrote a letter and said that this letter was very big.
You put it on your desk and then came back the next day and said, "Oh, what am I glad I didn't send it," right?
But we don’t do it with Twitter.
We send it out right away, we feel great and then you go to get a phone call, “Do you really think about it?”
I say, “What’s wrong with this?” and you’ll find out.
In the last month, Trump suffered a great anger after re-introduced the post (delivered material from other accounts) with a video of his supporters in the Village area of Florida where the elderly couple called “White power” or “elected whites.”
And in 2017, Trump reintroduced three posts directed against Muslims, published by Jaydu Fransen, leader of Britain First.
The president said Portnoy would reimburse those who had been in the most trouble.
Trump said: “You see something that looks good and doesn’t study it, you understand, and you don’t know exactly what’s on the helmet, which is tiny and you don’t grow it, sometimes — I’ve found that there’s almost always the restorations that come in trouble.”
The president often shares a compliment to himself, raping his opponent and co-authorship with 80 million followers on Twitter.
Trump says Twitter will help him reach through the so-called “fair news” on television shows and newspapers, which he says contradicts.
But the president’s lies have often been under investigation, and now the Twitter posts mean Trump’s misconception.
The GPS system may be unsafe
Many countries work to develop a different location technology than the GPS system.
Engineering professor says that the reason could be to worry about the security of the GPS system, which is owned by the U.S. Army.
The old Loran system has been re-introduced.
The GPS technology comes with us every foot.
We use it when we fly, navigate, and run, we measure, in terms of cost and leisure.
It is believed that she is a military officer in the U.S., who first opened her for the public use in the 1980s.
The GPS technology uses a cut from satellites of 20,000 kilometers above the ground, and therefore the conditions in nature have little impact on it.
“But it’s very easy to disturb her.
And ill-willed people can easily disrupt the reception of these marks," says Sæmundur E. Thorsteinsson, associate professor of engineering at the University of Iceland and expert on risk management and security communication.
He also says it’s easy to send an error tag with a wrong location, for example in the army.
“The GPS system is in the U.S. Department of Defense.
They have made sure that the system is in a hurry at all times.
But surely they can turn this off if it plunged into the head of a very special president to do so, then he could probably do it," says Sæmundur.
There are many states to consider that other systems and location technologies.
Both Russia and the Chinese work their own satellite system, and the European Union is destroying the Galileo location system.
“Galileo system is primarily built for citizen use.
It may have more accuracy and is naturally under the control of the European Union.
“It’s not a government that is attacking it completely, but a lot,” says Sæmundur.
But many people are also looking back to the old market.
It is based on radio waves and was used from the 6th century until the GPS technology took over.
The Larger Marks are sent on a very long wavelength from sent down to the bottom of the earth.
“It’s a new version of the Lorean system called eLoran, which stands for Enhanced Loran, men are seriously looking at it in many countries to have it as a system to be, because it is a little different laws to interfere with it, it’s much harder than disrupting satellite systems,” says Sæmundur.
It is probably safer to have access to as many locations as possible.
An employee of Vern Buchanan has been killed by the coronavirus
“Gary was a professional in fingernails and a devoted servant of the public,” Buchanan said on Facebook.
“He touched life so many people and was loved and loved by those who knew him.
I will never forget how vivid he was, the sense of joy that he received from helping others.”
Office Buchanan published a statement last month stating that Tibbett had no new communication with others in the office.
Tibbetts, who worked outside the office, had worked for Buchanan since 2011.
Florida has reported 414,511 cases from the beginning of World War I, which is more than 4,200 in New York, according to the health authorities in the states.
The state’s health authorities show that the entry into hospital has increased by 79% from the U.S. National Day, July 4th.
The data also show that at least 50 civil service units in Florida reached a limit of strength on Saturday.
“We knew that this could have impacted,” DeSantis said in June.
“At the same time, police work and putting the bill on this could have the opposite effect.”
Flaug from Hornafjörður to Cape Town
Tyrkúfa, rosarier, calculus, crossovers, glitches and weepings are among the birds that have fled to the land this summer.
On the website of the birds of Southeast Iceland.is can be seen near daily news of the rumblings, where they have been seen and sometimes their sex.
There are many birds in Iceland.
For example, there are a number of people who like the Facebook page Icelandic birds.
The group’s members are about 14.600.
There are pictures of birds and obvious that Iceland is rich in good photo images that have the patience needed to form birds.
Brynjulfur Brynjólfsson is one of them.
Binn, as he is called, is a working bird observation centre in the southeastern part of the country, and a natural garden in the southeastern part of the country, and is closely followed by the bird life in that area.
He speaks beautiful about this animal that gives life in Iceland and plays an important role, and it doesn’t matter whether the bird is large and large birds or small birds.
The bird observation centre was founded in 2005 on the birthday of Hálfdán Björnsson at Køskar in Öjarja, with a goal to keep air and continue the more intense natural research that he held from the year 1940.
“Hálfdán was thirteen years old when he began to talk about birds,” says Brynnjulful.
“We at the bird observation centre are not doing exactly the same thing as Hálfdán did, but are building on his data by counting and noting birds.”
Hálfdán was born on 14 March 1927.
He wrote a number of scientific articles on plants, insects and bird life.
He died on February 10, 2017, thirteen years old.
Hálfdán and his siblings at Kvískerk grew interest in many who met in Icelandic nature.
In that group, Björn Gísli Anarson, “a worker” is the bird observation centre.
Björn grew up in Reykjavík in the south, and he was a rich natural disciple with his neighbors, Hálfdán on Kvíksker.
But what is the fact that the bird’s planning centre in Southeast Asia does?
On March 20, each year, the bird’s bird’s bird’s bird takes up a special bird in Einsundur, a three-legged dose before the head of the Hornafjörður.
There are standard labels for the birds that come in the net.
The network is closed around May 10th, the planet starts.
The internet is up every day, at least from 6am in the morning and above noon.
They have to visit every hour.
The birds in them are marked, measured and then released into freedom.
Every hour, a reporter asks.
“Yes, we’re doing this with us, me and Björs.
As we now have to work for us, this can be a huge puzzle, but somehow we can do this," says Brynnjulf.
The Internet is back up during the 1st of August to 10th November — all days that weather permits.
between guarding the nets and during the periods that they are not above, Brynnjulf and Björn are to mark the crayons, the screeds and the various moots where they reach them.
In addition, they take special care.
One of these projects is working in collaboration with the National Institute of Natural Sciences of Iceland and is about collecting forests of birds.
"The forest mine steps on the birds of their winter centres and then moves with them to the land in the spring.
This happens shortly before they leave, and because of this, they are not big when they come to Iceland.
Then he jumps off the bird and tries to find someone else’s nest when he needs to keep it.”
A lot of shit.
Asked about how the birds in Southeast Asia had this summer, Brynjulf said that the wolf’s crust seems to be going well — as she overthrew the head of the beast.
“The entire war here is at Hala in the South, and everything goes well.
But there is no doubt that there was no longer a long time to find a cave where a few years ago there was a huge storm.”
He says that a few years ago, there has been more than a thousand crowns, but now it is possible to count them on other hands.
“When we look to the snow and waterbirds, I think it’s reduced in the last few years what you find them.
But it’s always a change between years.”
What can be clearly explained by the great change is that Brynjólfs is most likely to be on the rise.
“It’s all about food.”
The work of the human beings can also be said of the emergence of birds and other animals.
But some birds seem to have good things in Southeast Asia this summer.
“One of the things that I feel positive is that cows are growing again after a lot of pain,” says Brynnjulful, “but during the past few years and decades.”
Of the birds, it is news that it seems like the marionian will go well in their heat this summer, like last year.
The skirmishes and dufts had fallen slightly, but Brynjulfulger says it does not appear until autumn how this summer proved to be them.
But let's turn the rumblings.
Often they raise great attention, especially if they are very few and even colorful.
These two interesting shows are about one of the most popular wrestling events of the summer: the Rósarstarn.
“Arens has been relatively quiet this summer in the rumblings,” says Brynnjulfur, but mentions that in the band there is now a cry, and then a roundabout has been seen, and has been gone to escape here.
When Brynjul and Björn get into the woods, they also notice them, just like other birds.
It’s global, and it’s all over the world.
Various can be found with the meaning, e.g., each of the birds’ temperature centres, where they are guarding and each of their hazards.
“It can even be seen how long they are on a flight,” says Brynnjulf.
This information is useful in many ways, to form when it comes to mosquitoes such as birds.
“It’s always been an increase in knowledge.”
If someone outside the world finds a bird marked by the Icelandic Bird Observatory, the information is sent to the National Institute of Natural Sciences.
“We’ve recovered everything from Cape Town in South Africa.
There was a scar that we had marked.
One of us was found later in the United States.”
One bird is Brynnjwolf especially the idea and that’s the ghost.
"The school is our bird," he says, pointing out that the Bird Planet Center and the Natural Resources of Southeast Asia, for its mission to monitor his progress — which has become quite a waste, and now he has come on the roster.
It is hard to realize what has caused a crack in the foundation, but one theory is that the school has made a catch that was previously taken by fish boats and out into the sea to make it much better, and it has an impact on the cloud.
Are you in the best place to watch birds?
“You’re not going to get me to say no,” says Brynnjul Wolf laughing, adding: “Where we’re now also pursuing a flying bird, we may need to go wide.”
But certainly the South East is special when it comes to bird life.
“This area is as drawn into the country from Europe, but so the birds spread from here.
To be here is to look at the birds and bird flying is very interesting, but here is less to find from the birds than elsewhere in the country.
It’s not far from the mountains and to the glaciers, so the area that such a thing is suitable for the sighting of birds.”
But do you have a favorite bird?
He thinks of himself for a short time before he responds.
I think the question is hard.
“My bird is yet to be found nine out of the ten that have been seen in the land,” he said.
“I think it’s more fun to take pictures of the horrors.
So it’s always fun to find birds that haven’t seen before in the country or are rare, so I’m not talking about finding a new species for Europe.”
They have both brothers and sisters.
If you want to watch better with the work of Binna and Björssa at the Icelandic Birdlife Observatory, you can follow their work on Facebook and on the Birds web.is
Sádi-Arabía: The sun terrace of the future? No alcohol or bikini
The tourism industry has grown considerably over the last few years and now the government of Saudi Arabia wants its cut off of the kitchen.
The government spends about 60,000 million Danish kronas to create tourist paradises in the country.
The Guardian reports this.
However, this tourist paradise will not be in the style of Icelanders should be used in the south-east of Europe.
Alcohol will not be offered and women will not be allowed to sung in bikinis.
But how do you end up traveling to this amazing Islamic country?
For example, it should be done by traveling a new city where white beaches, moons (a white created by humans), larvae and robots serving people.
The Guardian says it is Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince Sádi-Arabia who wants to invest in this investment.
Of course, the money must be paid in the oil of the country.
The Crown Prince says that it is not a matter of whether women can release to cover shoulders and knees in public places, but admits that it is not easy to create tourist paradise in the country because it is too hot when the sun is in the air and cannot be trusted in wind-cooling.
However, it can also be said that it does not attract interested travelers if they can’t buy alcohol.
Francois Bozize, previously elected by the President of the Central African Republic, announces a presidential hearing
Former president of the Central African Republic, Francois Bozize, who had been elected by the Supreme Court, announced on Saturday that he would be presenting in the presidential elections in December despite the fact that the United Nations violated the sanctions and that the arrest directive had been issued for alleged crimes against humanity.
He announced his offer in speech before a large group of supporters at his parliament, Kwa na Kwa (“win, only win”), in the capital of Bangui.
This 73-year-old former military commander and commander was assassinated in 2013 in a rebellion against the majority of the Muslim rebels from the north who cast the nation as the majority of Christians, in the affluent civil war and serious and long-standing human rights activists.
“The government needs a man with experience, peace and conviction,” Bozize said in a speech that was critical of the current president’s office, Faustin-Archange Touadera.
Bozize first came to power in 2003 after running for president for over 10 years before he moved to the country in 2013.
The new government sought to arrest him for alleged crimes against humanity and to encourage genocide, but he has not been arrested since he returned from exile last year.
It is not clear how the arrest warrant or foreign sanctions affect his supply.
In January, Bozize said he would ask the United Nations to abolish the sanctions set in 2014 because of the support of armed Christian groups Anti-balaka.
Touadera is currently operating the country with the support of the United Nations Secretary-General, who believes more than 13,000 military and police officers.
He was elected in 2016 and is expected to have made a second term, but his offer has not been confirmed.
The first round of voting will be held on 27 December.
In February 2019, the government signed a peace agreement with 14 armed groups, usually defending the interests of certain communities or religions.
Since then, violence crimes have fallen, but still a bloody incident that is most often caused by a lack of resources, but the majority of these countries are not under the control of the government.
The victim has spent more than 1.5 million people fleeing their homes.
Real Madrid’s President Gareth Bale is “unbeatable for everyone,” says Toni Kroos.
Toni Kroos, midfielder Real Madrid, says the seat of Gareth Bale at the Spanish team is “unbeatable for everyone.”
Bale did not take part in any of the last seven games of the team and he took a little part in the LaLiga legend Los Blancos, and now this summer he has come up with the patty that the player will enjoy keeping quiet and let his contract run out, but the club hopes that he will break.
“There’s no way to avoid the situation being unpredictable for everyone,” said Kroos in a Lauschangriff Endlich magazine.
“He wasn’t able to play it as little as he is now.
In fact, I think he wanted to leave the club last summer and that the company actually said “yes” but then said “no” later.
I don’t know if he’s still a bit angry because of that.
When asked whether the circumstances had negatively impacted the atmosphere at Real, Kroos said: “Not as great as possible.
I have known him for six years and we have done a lot of important things together.”
China gives Reykjavík City 2,000 facewalls to support the fight against the coronavirus
China's ambassador, Jin Zhijian, delivered the mayor of Reykjavík to two thousand facets a week.
The meeting was held at the Chinese Embassy on 22 July last year.
Newspapers first came out.
The mayor’s visit was to reimburse the Chinese ambassador to Reykjavík, where he visited the city council and met with the mayor.
There was no doubt that there was an agreement between Reykjavík City and Xianyang City, but the locals began their partnership between 2014.
The gift, 2,000 facets, is about to run in this friendly partnership, but the city authorities of Xianyang wanted to give a mask and support the fight against the coronavirus epidemic.
Sees in the News Víkurfell that the masks will be used in the delicate foundations and workplaces of Reykjavík Towns for both employees and other guests there.
In the accompanying picture you can see and also get Iceland and the People's Republic of China, printed on the face mask box, where "Ber is each behind, except his brother does not."
Thomsen wants to leave KR - Calculated by lowering the levels
Tobias Thomsen will try to get home to Denmark, from Iceland's Champion KR, next month, and will find interest in the communities of the Danish 1st Division.
Thomsen has played in Iceland since 2017 and became Iceland’s Champion both with Val and KR.
On the other hand, this 27-year-old man claims to miss Danmark and wants to move there with his girlfriend, Stefani Jakobsdóttir.
The partnership of Danans at KR is valid until the end of this season, so it is clear that Danish society must negotiate with KR for a purchase price to get him in August, before the new game begins in Denmark.
Otherwise, Thomsen would wait until the winter to get to Denmark.
“Yes, I know that the Danish division will start again at the end of August.
That means, of course, that I had to demolish my contract with KR-ing, but I have told them that I swore to Danmark, and they have full understanding of it," Thomsen told the ball.dk.
He added that he should in a very good relationship with Rúnar Kristinsson coach, who had shown the position a full understanding, and Thomsen did not believe that the purchase price would be a big problem.
“I’ve also had two 1st division teams since the end of the division, and the team knew where they would end up.
It has been so interesting now that it may well be that I go to Denmark before the Icelandic division stops,” Thomsen said, adding that there were not many companies in Denmark that could purchase his contract with KR.
“It’s not clear now, but it’s been an interest.
I also need to find the best option for me and my girlfriend, who is from Iceland and comes with me.
"This depends on a few things," Thomsen said, and said, first and foremost, to the merchants.
Thomsen said KR-inga doesn’t have to worry that he doesn’t care about all the exercises and games, though he missed Dankel.
“KR knows what it gets from me and that’s how I do things 100 percent.
“I can honestly predict that I’m a dancer when I’m in training or in games,” Thomsen said, who says he’s going to lower the levels of going from the Icelandic Champions in the next division of Dankel.
“I’ll probably have to lower only in the labs, out of the coronavirus virus that seems to have been a terrible genetic community more than the Icelandic ones.
But I’m also in a class and one solution could be made for me to work.
Most of the groups in the 1st Division are now in agreement with the sponsors.
“I’m learning sports management through the team and finishing the bachelor’s degree,” Thomsen said.
Thomsen has only been in the first team of KR in two games in the Pepsi Max division at this time, but we have a history in five games and scored one goal.
He started 21 games for the team last year and scored seven goals.
KR is the same choice to score on the top Pepsi Max division and to play for good, but the team meets KA in Akureyri today.
On board a bus, the driver is in a hot rifle on a face mask.
The video shows passengers and drivers on board the Arriva bus in Liverpool taking care of the abuse.
The driver hears an explanation for a woman that it is not in his work ring to tell passengers to use a mask.
The driver said, “It’s not in my work ring to tell everyone who steps up in the wagon to use a mask.”
He said: “My older and older wife began to know that her and a lot of rifles went out.”
“The driver had to leave his seat and came to ask what was going on and he said one woman that she wasn’t even using the mask right.”
“The wife then ran away from the car and said he will report the incident.”
Arriva spokesperson said: “The safety of our customers and our employees is as early as the past.
“Our customers are the first to use a mask when using public transport (except when they use public transport).
“Such instructions and labels for customers regarding this and any other distance rules are on board street events, on social media and on our website.”
Crimes have been held in public transport since 15 June.

Octavia Spencer calls after Hollywood advises people to wear clothes more often in roles
The player participates in a new approach to the increase of the participation of people with a disability in the entertainment community.
The attack is ongoing at the same time as 30 years have passed since the date of the U.S. law on the rights of people with a disability, which takes place on Sunday.
In the video, Spencer talked about the importance that people see themselves and their lives reflected in a real way in the screen.
“Nothing can happen in place of personal experience and unexpected publication,” she says.
“That’s why it matters so much to hire an appropriate player in an appropriate role.”
Spencer talked about the effects she had because of seeing the voices of people on the screen when she was a little girl watching the show “Good Times”.
The teams that were shown at CBS in 1974 to 1979 were created by Norman Lear and they ran the way the first scenes to show two parents who were both of them from British origin.
Combating hunger push Yoho to the side after incident in the House of Representatives
WASHINGTON (AP) - A Christian organization that wants to end hunger said on Saturday that they had asked the Senator Ted Yoho to resign from the administration, and that he had become aware of it, after what they called "a terrorist" on Saturday, Alexandri Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat in New York City, sued Yoho, Senator República in Florida, to use a low-low and male-remely harshness, he claimed it when they met in the trenches of the House last Monday.
Yoho claimed that he had not used the words quoted to him, but the reporter who witnessed the incident confirmed that the word had been as she described it.
Bread for the World said in a statement that the administration of the talks had met Yoho on Friday and said after he claimed that “the right of our commitment to standing with women and hearing people, domestic and global, leading us to the world with increased participation of all races and equality as well as justice.”
On the Bread website of the World, their “samrist voice” pushes the parliament and the government to end hunger in the country and in the world.
“Those who are left for the World are independent of a Christian organization that aims to reduce hunger and poverty with confidence in public policies keep the organization in the air in respect of respect, dignity and care that Jesus asks us to show when we interact with people in selected places, wherever it is in the political realm,” says the statement.
“Our food reflects recently the actions and words of the Senator Ted Yoho, who was reported in the media, not the moral ideas made to our members.”
At the time of processing the news, a spokesperson Yoho had not responded by email with a response.
In an amazing speech in the Senate last Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez said in a dramatist way from the incident, accusing his words against what she called a male bullying that “accepts violence and violent violence against women.”
More than a dozen of her co-workers took the word that the incident was an example of all the common behaviors of men.
Yoho described the incident as a brief discussion of policy and that “something had been undone, acted in a single or became an attack.”
He said that he has shown a “bad relationship.”
The 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez is in his first season as a candidate and has received both praise and cargo for his clean-up.
The 65-year-old Yoho is one of the most contentious members of the House of Representatives, and he will sit in the holy stone at the end of his fourth term.
Please wait until 98 minutes in the locals to score the first goal of the season.
Jesse Lingard had not scored or put up in the English Premier League at this time, until he scored against Leicester today at 98th minute in the final round of the division.
Lingard had not scored in the English Premier League since he scored a double against Cardiff in December 2018.
He entered as a player today for Manchester United when the team came to Leicester in a match about the Champions League.
When spaced seven minutes, the usual playing time was directed by Kasper Schmeichel Markmann Leicester and scored in the field.
Long term with Jesse Lingard.
Real Madrid players reject rules of appeal
Zinedine Zidane and his disciples in Real Madrid will be able to join England in their second game with Manchester City, in the Champions League of Europe, without having to go for two weeks.
The British government has decided that tourists from Spain will have to go for a two-week visit to recover the virus.
However, there are exceptions, such as in case of competition at the highest level of sports.
This confirmed the performance of Sky Sports.
The committee says that the individuals who are excluded will only be in a restricted area, for odorous animals.
This is not about sports stars, judges, coaches, medical professionals and media outlets.
Madrid can meet Manchester City on August 7, without having to spend a long time in England, but they are 2-1 in the single after losing at Santiago Bernabeu on February 26.
The tournament will be held in 8th place, which will take place in Portugal.
Retirement and take over the country on the trade weekend
Of the news of the crowded hotels and camping areas to judge, at least in the south, it is clear that Icelanders have been able to travel inland this summer.
Have those who have landed under foot have also been lucky with the weather and weather forecasters DV at one point that the summer has only been clean, so far to at least.
It’s been a long time since the last weekend of the year.
However, it is unclear how it will be this year, compared to other weekends, now that events that in a normal year have led to a large number of people not being held.
It is important to mention a national holiday as an example.
The weather will, of course, play a major role, but now it’s a look for the liberation of all countries, but especially the south and southwest.
The weather forecast from Thursday night and at least on Saturday night.
An example is that long-term years are not a sacred truth here in the north of Atlantic Ocean, and can, of course, change.
The weather scientist kná Einar Sveinbjörnsson says in his prediction on the weather conditions, Bluk, that it is expected that the shopping weekend is expected.
He says: Doctors in the high ceilings with a belonging cold that often also closes down to the surface, leads to the fact that when the warmer air from the southwest attempts to approach is only formed by wind and discharge.
It is also a warm air that is “failible” here in the north.
Einar publishes his predictions for support and says: “Little waves from America are brought to the east and with her summerly air.
When she approaches her “blom” in the form of a reducing air pressure and a more reliable summer climate.”
The big prediction, the European calculator to the left of the map and the American GFS forecast to the right are quite different with this development.
The late Thursday and early Friday will be the day of the year with the A-Swiss and the rain of the most part of the country.
The dose of 985 hP is then followed.
This time, there is quite a warm air in North and East Iceland on Saturday and even Sunday as well.
However, it could be blue because of that.

Elti playwoman from Law and Order all the way to New York
“I was shot in her as a man gets such a childhood shot,” says Birna Hrunn Björnsdóttir about Mariska Hargitay, the main character of Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
She was so close by the actress that she was able to attend the show and waited for her time together, just to be able to say hi.
When Birna Hrönn Björnsdóttir, the owner of the airline company Pink Iceland, looked like many Icelanders on the points of Law and Order: Special Victims Unit up from the ages, then colloquially she looked for the main role of Mariska Hargitay.
Birna tells the story of her meetings and the actress in the episode of The Adventures of Rás 1.
When Birna was herself a teenager, at the age of the age that many began to develop with her absolutism, she did not experience her peers because she stood in a strict line of her own teaching.
She thought she was interested in the boys' costumes and young suitcases from movies, but didn't have it at all.
“I was cutting off the sheets and hanging pictures on the wall of Backstreet boys and Jared Leto.
But there was nothing behind it, it was just me to hide that I was a lesbian.”
She says sometimes that when people get out of the closet, they go through the trash.
“We’re going to cut down these young girls, those shots, and so on.
“I think it was one of the things that led me to her,” Birna said.
“There was something about her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm, and I was just shot in her shoes.”
It ran into a scandal when she was in New York City a few years ago.
One of her best friends, Erlingur Óttar Thoroddsen, was shooting a movie there in the city and got Birnu and their friend, Gunnar Helga Guðjónsson, to help with the shootings.
“We were working for 30 people and we spent a lot of time with strangers.
It’s a natural atmosphere when you spend such a long time together, so it’s all about everything and nothing.”
One day, Birna is a great fan of Mariske.
One woman in the recording says his friend is familiar with the show because he was in the show.
Birna couldn’t stop thinking about that fact and asks her new girlfriend regularly how her friend likes to work with the actress and whether Birna can meet her.
“She tells me to stop it, she doesn’t know if she can do it,” Birna said.
At the end of the film, the group finished and Birna tries to convince the woman to try to get the meeting around.
“She had gotten a few glasses and said she’d just do it.”
A few days later, Birna sends the woman a message and asks if something is going on in the matter.
The woman does not respond and Birna decides to give up.
One morning she wakes up with a long message.
“I looked at the phone and yelled at me.
Gunnar Helgi wakes up with the ashes, and I say, I have to go to the shower, and I have to make myself fine and go down to town."
The woman had written to Birnu for her friend, actors and crew Law and Order were supported at the Times Square hotel.
“I don’t know when they start or when they stop, but this is the name of the hotel, going well,” says the message and Birna dressed up in the snout. She asks in the reception where the footage is taking place and takes the lift up to 45th floor where the group has come together.
The wife arrives and waits until her wife arrives and asks this unhappy woman whether he can help.
“I said I was looking for Jason and asked the woman to tell him that the Birna from Iceland had arrived.”
When the friend finally arrives, he watches Birnu and asks how in the chaos she came all the way to the finish line to be a strict security guard.
She said she had just taken the elevator and asked to meet Mariske.
“Yes, I don’t know.
Sit here," said the friend and Birna.
On her side, she sits more attractive in the show, and they begin to talk together.
“I say to him, ‘I am a fan, but you?’ says Birna.
“I played it as if it was the most natural thing in the world.”
Time is coming and Birna is waiting.
The players come up regularly when the breaks are made, they get talk and Birna looks around and search Mariske which is nowhere to be seen.
Finally, the friend comes and tells her that he is sorry to leave.
The brothers ask him to get into his hands on the other employee, not to let her go anything right away.
A friend accepts it and closes to another employee.
“He comes with another friend and says, “This is the woman from Iceland who wants to meet Mariske.”
Then he goes.
Finally, after two hours of waiting, a new friend arrives at Birnu.
“He says, ‘Fleet.
These are unusual situations today, there are journalists with her so she won’t stop.
She goes the most direct way in a car with them so you have to take the chance and go down and find her caravan.
It’s white and it’s marked.
Hurry up."
“I look at the right and lose my face,” Birna’s high places off and go with the elevator down at Times Square.
It is found in about 40 caravans, some of which are marked and not numbered.
However, she does not find herself, and then she is desperate to wear a collar.
“I find the buggy all over me because I’ve been spending half a day on this, but think so, I tried.
It was fun."
Vonuf holds Birna back to the hotel where she sees in the window of the shooting watching herself with the windows of the windows, finally realizing that Birnar couldn't do his work.
Birna agrees with the fate and it begins to rain.
“I’m going under a cloud to shoot me for the rain.
I look right and lose my face.”
No other than the Marish Hargitay, it was in the bauxite that she was dressed in the show and Birna knew the spectacle — but Birna could hardly move by mental healing.
“I look at my body and your hands and think now you’ll be moving.
Now you have to go to her.”
The guys do it and they get up to dick on the shoulder of the game girl.
“She looks at me and I can hardly say anything.
“I just say hello,” Birna said.
“I say I’m from Iceland and a great fan.
She says, “It’s nice to meet you.”
The interview didn’t reach much further because the car Mariske is here and it’s embarrassing.
Marika turns to Birnu and says, “I have to go but it was really nice to meet you.”
The Birna say goodbye to the attacker, looking at the car driving away and breaking so together.
“I’m calling a ghost in Erling and Gunna, and they thought it wouldn’t have been done.
But I was crying with excitement and joy.
I say, yes, I'll meet her, you'll meet me now.
So we went to the lake and took a car," Birna said.
She doesn’t know anything, but she probably won’t repeat the game.
“It’s like that once in a lifetime, to sacrifice such a time and energy in such a way.
But I’ll always be a fan of this woman.”
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Birnu Hrönn Björnsdóttir in the episode of Rás 1.
Police are not spreading the viruses.
It is not possible to worry that the coroner can be drilled with alcoholics that the police use.
This is the police officer in the police department in a conversation with the mbl.is.
Tips have drilled mbl.is from people who are concerned that the same mouthpiece is used for all drivers when the police arrive, occurs on a traffic street and makes everyone who has a way around blues.
The police say the most purest of all, though.
“It’s not really a special mouthpiece, but we’re recommending the bees that people are blowing in,” the police chief said.
“We want to put the guards at this point, but we guide people to keep a little distance, up to a few tugs late.
Asked if it was a comfortable distance, the police said so.
Try to show positive, use the police so we can measure it.
It has a mouthpiece, but it comes from sealed plastic bag and is only used once.
Thin abdomen: Among other things, an attack can be imposed to reduce pain
The relationship with depression is not coincidence.
Individuals who suffer from dermatitis, which is a disease characterized by abdominal pain, vomiting, hives, headaches, slowing down and diarrhoea, often find anxiety and depression, which can lead to worsening symptoms according to the anxiety and depression groups of the United States (ADA).
“This is because the rice plant is controlled in part by the nervous system, which responds to stress,” explains ADAA.
If the ban doesn’t decrease, it could be about food resistance.
Dúri tries to stop the decision that children will be released from domestic territory.
In his ruling on Saturday, Dolly Gee unveiled a long-term period of time by saying that domestic and customs authorities in the United States do not have to allow children to be released if one of the three routes described in the previous directive is not possible.
Gee also stressed it in his decree that the immigrant and customs authorities would be forced to leave the children without any hesitation.
The three persons who Gee is accused of letting families who are holding domestic and customs authorities free together, put children into the hands of the controller, or allow families to free themselves from prisons.
Shalyn Fluharty, the founder of the Institute of Proyecto Dilley, which provides families in holding legal services, condemned the decision and said it put it into hands the immigrant and customs authorities to decide whether to continue having children.
“The important thing is that children are kept busy and they don’t leave out unless the immigrant and customs authorities consented to it or the families agree to put themselves apart,” said Fluharty.
Families are held at three locations in the Pacific and Customs District in Berks, Pennsylvania, South Texas (Dilley) and Karnes County, Texas.
The children of these places are aged 1 to 17 years under the laws and representatives of law enforcement.
Gee, who oversees the implementation of the Flores Agreement on the care of children in custody, said in June that “the rules on the use of the mask and the social media would not be or badly followed” would be year-old to transfer children from these workplaces.
969 people detained in the domestic and customs authorities have been identified by the coronavirus and are in isolation or monitoring as of 23 July, according to domestic and customs authorities.
Of these, 25 are confirmed cases in Karnes, one in Dilley and two in detention centers for families.
More than 3,700 cases have been confirmed in custody
I would like to look at the legislation on independence of the board.
The Prime Minister does not say that pension funds have an unusual role in their investment policy on the rights of people.
The Board of Directors shall ensure that the independence of the Board of Directors of a pension fund may be taken into account by law.
After Icelandair struggled with Iceland’s airline, Iceland’s air carrier said all flight operators described VR’s control of the board of directors appointed by VR in the management of Icelandair’s foreign trade fair or paid a vote against the participation of the pension fund in the expected part-time Icelandair.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of VR, said that the Board of Directors would be replaced if they were unable to attend.
Ragnar Þór took his statement back three days later as well as control VR.
Ásgeir Jónsson, CEO of RÚV, said on Friday to ensure the independence of the board of directors of the pension fund in the approved fund and possibly by legal change.
Katrin Jakobsdóttir’s prime minister says it’s important that the board of directors are independent, but think it’s already safe with the law.
“Now, the bank manager, who, of course, goes with the Financial Supervisory Authority, who has to do this, has said that it needs to look into the specific regulation around this independence, of course, we will take it into account if something has to go over there,” she says.
Katrin says that the laws under which pension funds should set a moral interest in their investment policy.
It is important to consider the social and moral criteria that they want to focus on in their investments.
“I didn’t feel bad too that pension funds also put an interest in their investment policy on the rights of people.
But I think it’s normal for such decisions to be taken through dating but not through individual investment decisions,” says Katrin.
“Insurgent traffic jams at Ölfusbárbúr,” the president of the city of Árborg said.
Helgi S. Haraldsson, President of the City of Årborg, said traffic jams, which form at Ölfusárbúrbún at Selfossi daily completely undisturbed.
He hopes to leave for a new bridge over Ölfusá in the autumn.
Now that Icelanders are traveling around their country and a great traffic is on the national roads of the country, daily traffic routes are created with Ölfusárbrunn when drivers are on their way to Selfoss or through the city centre.
Long rows are formed at the edge and can take on the patience of the drivers to wait in a row.
“Yes, it’s absolutely unbelievable, it’s a traffic jam here and not just on Fridays because it’s just been on active days too.
There are wishes, sometimes quite up to Hellisheiði for those who want to get here on their way to the east of the country and those who are coming to the west, so it gives an eye the way that we need to get a new bridge and not later than yesterday," says Helgi S. Haraldsson, President of the City of Árborg.
Helgi says that the city council in Árborg had recently met with the Director of the Road Administration and designed the road construction and the meeting was very positive.
“If you’ve ever been optimistic that it’s working on these issues, I think I can say it now because it’s really working on it and we’ll be able to see a new bridge coming out in the fall.”
But at Helgi any advice to those drivers who are waiting for Ölfusárbrún during the summer months?
“Yes, it is possible to go through the riverside and through the Eyrarbank, it flies for but those who are going east on the hill, it cannot indicate them to go the Lyngdalshein but those who are going to the uplands should be using Mosfellshei, Þingvevúv and Lyngdalshei.”
Helgi S. Haraldsson, President of the City of Årborg, who says the traffic camp, which is formed by Ölfusárbún at Selfoss's unfavorable.
Long waits are formed every day at Ölfusbárbúr and drivers often need to wait for a considerable amount of time to get across the bridge.
The only advice is to take the breath deep and think something positive.
The future of the Koreans in the north of Brisbane takes place for planning
The city council said that, as well as the area, there was a lifelong home of the royal Arabs, the Greeks, and the grey-necked, it would be an important link between Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek.
As a result, the Commission has appealed to the City Council for the organisation and environmental policy of the Court of Justice with the arguments that the construction is in accordance with the laws of the Civil Rights Act of 2014, it would meet the organisational and social needs that have not been fulfilled to this end and “to do so without undue effect”.
There is a great deal of opposition to these efforts in the urban environment.
The Commission maintains that despite the fact that it is fully compliant with the plan, it may be possible to change it if it does not meet requirements, rather than to reject it.
As mentioned above, the implementation involves many stages, including a service station, a child care facility and 39 apartments.
Official submissions were more than 120 at the time of the meeting and most of them protested the bill where it was too large and inappropriate for the area.
The leader of the city council of Brisbane said that the city needed to buy the country to protect the crownbird.
“The Mayor of Brisbane,” said Mayor Adrian Schnjerer, “will stop wasting the taxes on taxpayers in the fight with the contractors for judgment and buy this country to protect the nature and wildlife of Brisbane,” Mayor Cassody said.
“This is one of the most important world-famous cobala trees in the mountain to Mangroves and there are a lot of cobalabjars.”
Schwerner said that the city government wanted to re-elect the royal army in the area.
“We were not found suitable for the area,” Schnner said.
“I understand that this is going through the judgment system and obviously we hope that it will lead to a good and positive outcome that will be kept to the world.”
Schriner said that the bill of the home of the royal army was a joint responsibility of the citizens and governments, but that the government is responsible for accurate maps of the home of the royal army, which local authorities support when taking applications for treatment.
The next step is to work something.
Ole Gunnar Solsjær, coach Man Utd, was hoping that the team had secured third place in the English Premier League today.
The team will play in the Champions League of Europe in the next season.
United had to win against Leicester today and was the result of the 2-0 win of the Red Devils.
“Great performance for players to reach third place based on how the situation has been in the period.
I think that the stars could have reached the spiritual heart by working such a great deal, where we have lost twice in the finals of this period.
We knew that we needed a look today, now we can have the next chapter that is with these boys to win titles," Solsjær said.
Manchester United still have the chance to win the title during this season, but the team played in the European Cup in August and is so good that came in 8th place there.
Vopnahlé begins in the middle of the war in Eastern Ukraine
Kíev, Ukraine - Ukraine's military and anti-spyrian forces in eastern Ukraine are now preparing the "unfair" ceasefire that will begin in mid-2010 and which representatives hope to be the first step towards peace after the conflict.
The representatives of the anti-Spyrenea said on Sunday that they had given their army orders for weapons of arms and issued a ban on the use of weapons.
Ukrainians said their “have prepared” for the ceasefire.
If it seemed to go, it would “do the way for the implementation of the other provisions” of the Minsk Convention, according to the Ukraini Office, earlier this week, where the ceasefire was called a time-limit.
The aim of the Minsk Peace Agreement, which was made in 2015 through France and Germany, was to solve the conflict between Ukraine and the separations that enjoy the Russian Federation, but the conflict began in 2014 after the Russian Federation’s annexation in Crimea and support of the country’s separation.
More than 14,000 people have been killed in the attack.
Presidents of Russia and Ukraine celebrated both arms raids on Sunday and stressed the importance of meeting the agreement reached at the Paris meeting in December.
Vladimir Putín, Russia’s president, turned out to be concerned about the call for the Minks Agreement to be reviewed and said that the outcome of Volodimyr’s Seylensky, Ukraine’s vice president, was to reflect in real action.”
On the other hand, Seylensky focused on the need to take action to liberate the Ukrainians who are prisoners of the rebels in Eastern Ukraine, in the Muslim Crimea and in Russia, according to the statement of the president.
According to the 2015 agreement, Ukraine can only receive a cross-border crossing of Russia in the areas in which the secessionists have power when they have gained widespread self-governance rights and when elections have been held in the countryside.
The invasion took place, but Ukraine and the rebels have continued to strike.
When the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris in December to have other talks, there was a clear support for the Minsk Agreement and agreed to restart the peace process.
Seylensky, who won the elections in 2019 with a promise to end the conflict, wanted Ukraine to get over borders for the first regional elections, but the government of the Kremlin demanded that the agreement be implemented without any change.
The new ceasefire agreement was reached on Wednesday for a three-way cooperation group, which was commissioned by Russia and Ukraine as well as the Security and Cooperation Agency of Europe, and was therefore celebrated by EU officials.
At the traditional Sunday meeting at St. Peter’s Basilica, Francis also reminded Pope Francis of the armed forces, saying that it needed “build trust and lay the foundations for very necessary and long-term harmony with the people.”
Police: A man shot dead in protests in Texas
AUSSTIN, Texas (AP) - A man was shot dead in protests in Texas when he approached a car and the driver in the car rushed off his weapon, according to police.
Katrina Ratfiff, a police spokesperson, told reporters early Sunday that the shooting took place just before 22:00 a.m. on protests in Austin.
The man was taken to a hospital where he was later killed.
The car had flown down the road, and since then the speed of travel towards protesters, Michael Capochiano testified to the newspaper Austin American-Statesman.
The man, who had a rifle, said Capochiano, approached the vehicle and was shot by the driver.
The driver then went to the crime, Capochiano said.
Ratfiff told reporters that the first rainy day indicates that “the victim’s sacrifice could have been a rifle,” and added that the suspect was in custody and would be happy to cooperate with the police.
According to news reports, the group had gathered together because of the Black Lives Matter allegations on Saturday.
The audience was streamed on Facebook and could hear in the whistle of the car and a few shots that were dropped off.
Markasúpa for the first win in July
Breiablik won the first division title from 29 June, the team headed IA to strike, 5-3, in Pepsi Max's division of men at Kopóvogsvelli this evening.
Players lose their third game in a row in the division.
After winning his first three games in the division, Brenetablik played five games without celebrating a victory and had lost three in a row for the game at IA tonight.
It was due to be killed or killed for Bluk, who met with a lot of power into the game.
Alexander Helgi Sigurðurson led the team in the lead by a team of law enforcement in the 11th minute after Kristin Steindórsson had sent him through the IA.
Six minutes later, Kristin doubled his lead after a single-legged preparation of Gísla Eyjólfsson's left edge.
There were no countries or beaches in the first half where high-pressure homes made them difficult for connecting shipments together.
Blkar had all the power of the well-being and the third goal of the 36th minute when Dann Thomas Mikkelsen struck the Horcruxes of Gunnlaugsson.
Then Kristin Steindórsson scored his second goal and fourth mark Blaka just three minutes later.
The first half didn’t end there.
Prosecutors were disappointed for the latter when Tryggv Hrafn Haraldsson scored out of the hospital’s pacifier’s shame for the playoffs, but Kwame Quee had then broken the cleric of Viktori Jónsyn before the teigs Blika.
4-1 was the location of the Breiablik when the half-sleeved gall.
Only three minutes were left with the second half when Skagamen scored again.
Hlynur Snarður Jónsson was then alone and unelected on the groundbreaking Blika and knocked the ball easily into the net by the horny shield Tryggn Hrafns Haraldsson.
However, Hlynur became a broken one within teny IA just three minutes later when he broke up at Alexander Helga.
The Vítsyrenes were convicted and Thomas Mikkelsen scored the safety to bring Breinablinki 5-2 over when only seven minutes were teamed up by the latter half.
Five minutes after the mark of Mikkelsen, Skagagers scored again.
Anton Ari Einarsson, the mark guard Blika, landed under pressure from Viktori Jónssyni, gave the ball to Viktor's where the ball was rejected in the net.
An amazing 5 to 3 was the most difficult time when less than ten minutes were the team of the second half, but it slowed down the field challenge after that.
Despite the fine lead of both teams to add to the dark, including two death opportunities Kwame Quee of the Breakin Bible, they did not become more and 5 to 3 wins the Brexit match.
Breiablik won with the first victory for a month, from 29 June, and is the team after the victory with 14 points in the third place, two points from Val, which is the seat of too much and three from the top KR.
KR and Val have both games in Blåka.
The team has to accept the third loss in a row, but the team has 10 points in the eighth place, five points from the fall.
Despite the White House’s discussion
The producers of the Hvolpa group’s right yesterday did not stop showing the child’s interest in the near future.
According to Kayleigh McEnany, the White House’s media representative, Kayleigh McEnany, said that the elements, including the law enforcement dogs, were victims of “exhibitions” (e.g. cancel culture).
Canadian producers were quick to respond to McEnany’s words and published that their fans did not need to worry about the future of the Hvolpas.
A number of television enthusiasts who are concerned about the work police have been expelled from the show in the United States following protests against police abuse.
It is not among them, despite the fact that it has been applied to social media.
On Friday’s White House press conference, McEnany said that Trump’s U.S. President was “excellent” and especially when it came to the police.
The term refers to whether or not individuals or businesses raise a strong response to social media, and it is called after the party is the format of protest.
“We saw it a few weeks ago that the show at the Hvolpasvík, the children’s topic of police, was stopped.
"As with the Cops and Live PD," McEnany said on Friday.
Then she added that Danish player Lego has taken legal care of the sale, but no foot is for the claim of defenders Lego.
However, it is true that Cops and Live PD have recently been released from the show where the West Sea is located.
Both parties include representatives for showing images of real police officers without getting permission from individuals who appear there.
For 29 years, sometimes it comes up with scarcity and scarcity.
Kristín Tómsdóttir’s family therapist answers questions the reader’s questions about issues are the family, the children and the love of the families of DV.
This time, she answers readers who have never been single.
We have been together since we were 15 years old, have been together for 29 years and have two children.
We know nothing but being together and we feel good, but we both have the same team as we are going to be wrong with something.
We have never been with other people and have no relationship with how this could be different.
This has sometimes caused confusion and lack of sense in relation to whether the other party is looking around itself, thinking about endurance or even divorce and changing.
When we talk about it, we agree to cultivate our relationship, but this is the kind of nightmare that always hangs over us.
Do you have any advice?
Thank you very much for the great question and I am glad you have such an open communication that you can talk about your complex feelings in connection with your relationship.
What would scare me would be if you were thinking about it in either corner, couldn’t talk about it and even climb some steps that you could see later.
At the top of the table, isn’t it always best?
Strong self-image has the most predictive value of happiness in the future and the stronger self-image you live across, the more likely you are to own a partner with a strong self-image.
The reason that relationships that begin in teens are not only always life, is often the fact that people grow in each direction, but in the cases where interactions can become more consistent, individuals can become stronger overall than many others.
Since your relationship begins to form on your most important forms of formation, you can draw a conclusion that you have grown together and have a positive impact on the self-image of each other.
We’re talking about the relationships we’re in.
How I speak, it’s about how you listen.
How I show myself depends on how you see me.
Relationships between who we are.
Ask yourself what others have not?
What does this year’s experience give us?
I promise that the benefits can be much more than the flaws.
You’ve met each other for years and you can tell that you’re customized to each other.
There are more than many people can say.
Is that worth it?
You’re talking about experiencing that you’ve lost something, but it’s important to remember that big changes such as divorce and new relationship also follow the follow-up fish you’re not necessarily excited about.
You may be missed by starting a new one, learning to be one again, getting to know new people and putting together families.
This follows new challenges, different problems, and possibly something new and exciting.
But this doesn’t just follow a pale cloud and a hammer, unlucky, at your age, this can become a drooling task, which can never be smeared as well as you have already done each other.
Is it worth it?
Wouldn’t it be possible to put the focus on what you can do to increase tension, unforeseenity and innovation in your relationship?
You haven’t put your shoes on the shelf.
There are so many things you can do to make your long relationship even deeper.
What experiments can you do in connection with it?
What do you need from your partner you are not getting?
What can you give to your spouse you’ve never done before?
You may need to sit down and rediscover your relationship.
Do you want to spend more time alone or together?
Do you want to try something new?
Today, much more tolerance towards various forms of communication and couples is being made to define their relationships in various ways, such as open connections, multiples, or decides to stop temporarily together.
I’m not telling you what you have to do, yet no expert in your solutions, but possibly it would ease this heavy noise that surrounds you, if you look at it and think in solutions.
What do you need so much to feel and to fear each other?
You’ve been together for 29 years, so it’s important that you can do things together.
Use it as strength and stay in your hands towards your solution.

Coleen Rooney directs lawyer Johnny Depp in "Wagatha Christie" rhyme with Rebekah Vardy
Coleen Rooney has asked David Sherborne to defend against the charges against Rebekah Vardy
After discussions between the spouses of the footballers came out about you expect their acquaintances with the dramatist settlement
Coleen Rooney has counseled the Star Lawyer in the talk of Johnny Depp to defend himself in the so-called "Wagatha Christie" teammate with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday claims that Rooney was hiding from David Sherborne's attempts to defend himself against Vardy's injuries, stating that personal data had been leaked to the media by its closed Instagram access.
The news took place a few days after data was passed to the Supreme Court, where it is reported that Rebekah Vardy, who is married to Jamie Vardy in the Leicester City football team, suffered physical and mental post-conceptions Coleen Rooney.
In the paper, the five children’s mother, aged 38, said, “A serious misconception and anxiety attack so she was afraid to go out of the house” and that Vardy, who had been seven months on the way, “have three been admitted to a hospital ... because of the anxiety disorder that can be traced to the passing and its consequences.”
In addition to being a lawyer Depp in his trial against The Sun, due to the claim that the actor had carried his wife, Sherborne, 50 years old, with the case of the Duke and the Duchess of Sussex in their private affairs against Associated Newspapers, the publisher The Mail on Sunday.
After a dispute between the two footballers, expect those familiar with the drama settlement in the courtroom.
“If you found the Depp trial, don’t underestimate the potential war of the football elite friends,” said an official.
"Now this is a real war. Coleen doesn't give any attention, and not Becky either. This will be emotional."
Coleen Rooney claimed that someone who used Instagram access Rebekah Vardy had leaked stories about her for journals.
She was nominated “Wagatha Christie” after realizing how she lasted five months to limit gradually the number of friends who could see updates to Instagram stories in her, until only the account Vardy was left.
Coleen says he’s seen a story on Instagram, which has since appeared in a newspaper.
In Vardy’s case, which refuses to represent the case, she argues that she has been made a baffle after Rooney published the allegations, “in order to cause a great injury and a terrible suffering.”
Lawyers Coleen has drawn these words into doubt and said that the recommendations of her suffering are just presented to the media and drew attention from the facts of the case.
He said, “The noise from Becky is a diversion, this is all the way up.”
It is the lawyer Paul Lunt of the law firm Brabners in Liverpool, which carries the case of Coleen Rooney, who has four sons with former England champion Wayne Rooney.
Vardy is in the law firm Kingsley Napley in London, it is unclear whether she has counseled a lawyer yet.

"Fox News Sunday" on interview one week after interview Chris Wallace with Trump
In a tweet with Chris Wallace last week, Trump said Trump was expecting President Trump’s next presidential candidate, Joe Biden, to attack the question of Wallace’s decision to fall on Trump.
If we don’t want to answer that question, at least not in a car.
On Sunday, Wallace informed the viewers that Bidens would have told Fox News that he was “not free” in the interview.
"In our interview with Trump last week, he was doubting that his opponent in the Democratic Party, Joe Biden, would be in similar circumstances," Wallace said.
“At the end of the week, both of Biden’s election and they said that the former vice president was not free.”
“We continue to ask each week,” he added.
Trump’s election team has been investigating Biden for avoiding election meetings and news meetings while attending interviews during the coronavirus epidemic.
Although Biden has recently had his new election campaign, Trump and his associates have continued to be the former vice president of Delaware for “feeling” their home in Delaware.
However, the trained Bidens to attend public events has not had any fun for his offer, since the latest polls show that Biden has a good reputation for Trump both at national and in major battles.
Real Clear Politics reported that the president was 7 percent below in Florida, 6.7 percent in Pennsylvania, 8.2 in Michigan and 6.4 in Wisconsin.
Trump won in all four states in 2016 and he is turning them over to the Republican Party when he won the fight for the White House.
In the latest Fox News Poll survey, Biden is inducted into Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, with no damage in all cases.
The researchers also point out that Biden had a slight advance in Ohio, North Carolina and Arizona, three other important struggles in this election.
And the Canadians point out that the kingdom that was previously trusted by the Repúblicas, such as Texas and Georgia, is now changing between Trump and the former Vice President.
Elections in which the President of the House of Commons has been held during the second term of the White House are often voting for that president - and it seems to be the case now in 2020 in the fight between Trump and Bidens.
The most important issues have been the coroner and economics that are subject to the epidemic — and the performance and history of the president in both cases.
Kanye West and his struggle with mental health
Kanye West today asked his wife, Kim Kardashian, apologized for the accusations he had caused to fall into jealousy.
He believes he is taking his creative power in mental health, but psychologists say it is important that people take a medicine to keep the disease in a spoon.
Kanye West is not only one of the most original and influential musician of the time, but he is not known as the real-life star Kim Kardashian.
His personal life has largely gone through open tents.
It sparked a great deal of attention when he announced earlier this month that he was preparing for president in the United States, and held emotional and broken speech.
Later, some special things were reported from him on Twitter, including his wife trying to put him into the hospital.
Kim Kardashian later published a statement on Instagram asking people to show their husband and family understanding; he was with a psychotherapist, and it would be difficult for his loved ones to help him if he did not want to seek help himself.
He has since apologized to her publicly.
This famous family is not alone in dealing with this problem.
It is estimated that about one percent of people have a mental health problem.
Ferdinand Jónsson is a dentist at the hospital in London, and knows the disease well.
“This disease can cause such a tremendous shock for individuals and especially their families and loved ones.
This overwhelming or mania can ruin relationships and work and cause inconceivable sadness.
And then the other side, depression, it is often dangerous, because it is a high frequency of suicide in that group.
So I thought it was nice that she should say it.
“It’s just human and human,” says Ferdinand.
The son of Unnsteinsson, the chairman of Gádjáljár, has himself struggled with mental health — and is a fan of Kanye West: “He seems to be with a very strong imagination.
If we are four strict ground bases, then he is one hundred string heavenly harps.
And he is so very creative, extremely powerful and smart in his difficult relationship interest, because one must be with this relationship interest that we have had to try it to go into a state of despair so well."
Kanye West does not want to take psychiatric drugs, because he thinks they pull out of his creativity.
He has discussed the mental health issues, including the album Ye.
The doctor says that it is his choice to not take a medicine.
“Most people find it hard to embrace this creative element that lies in this unremarkable relationship-thinking and the excess creative power of the fire that he has, but so are the natural flaws of the great suffering, and the cold valleys and dark chandeliers and darkness.”
Ferdinand says, however, it is important that people with schizophrenia receive treatment.
“If you have a lot of embarrassment or mania, you’re nothing to create great things, you’re just on the side.
And as people go into severe depression, people are completely paralyzed by that condition," he says.
Would you recommend Kanye West to take medication?
“Of course,” says Ferdinand.
“And especially to work with someone to find the right dosages and this way to ensure that the medication helps him as the most, and destroys the least for him and his abilities and his creativity.”

“A woman’s nurse” said the ambassador wants a gun, a broken car, and a cutting vest - said undermen would be recalled “the slave”
U.S. Ambassador Jeffrey Ross Gunter is quoted as saying he wants a gun on CBS news today.
CBS said: “For being located in one of the safest states in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter is “worsely sick” about his safety since he came to Reykjavík last year.
Displays CBS in 12 diplomats, directors and former representatives as well as individuals familiar with the case.
Gunters was required by the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs that they wish for a permit before the ambassador armedly to take action on the armed territory of the country.
He also wants to have a car that travelled with him between places in Iceland and the Lower East.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs refused to express itself as to whether some threat was caused by the security of the ambassador, but representatives of the U.S. government said that the ambassador had been told that Iceland was a safe country and that he was safe here.
Although it had been announced after the lives of the Icelandic newspapers, CBS says, and it is a team to become the ambassador’s demands.
CBS said the Icelandic Foreign Ministry did not want to talk about CBS.
However, the U.S. news agency has since its sources in the country that no one has been living in the territory of the government.
In addition, CBS says Gunter has been spoken of by armed forces in which it would insult the country's territory, Iceland.
The Prime Minister announced his tenure in order to have a short deal with President Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.
He had previously been a medical surgeon in California.
Since Gunter took part in Maí, he said he has created a “possible” working environment in the embassy and has already had seven sub-committees, so-called Deputy Chief of Mission, the ambassador who is also exiled diplomas.
It was all of us who tried to dissipate from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.

The ambassador of South Africa has also signed a petition for the operation of the number two men and tried to ship her son in the job.

Poland will tell you about the European Convention on the Prevention of Violence against Women
Poland’s government says that the country will withdraw from the European Union’s agreement to prevent violence against women.
The Istanbul Agreement is the first binding legal act in the world that aims to prevent violence against women, but the Minister of Justice of Poland, Zbigniew Ziobro, describes the text as “legal” in which he claims that schools teach children about gender from a social perspective.
Ziobro said this weekend that on Monday, he would begin to prepare the formal process for the country to resign from the deal.
“This conceptual aspect is related to experiments to change education in schools and leisure activities, that it is for study, attitude and conviction of young generations of Poles, based on the conclusion that our belief is wrong, that biological gender is old and that it is all about social gender.”
Ziobro believes that the provisions of the agreement on education for children and young people, as well as family relations in the context of LGBT people, are indispensable.
“We also have the LGBT series in the discussion on family affairs, because this is an opinion held in the air by left prosecutors or groups of homosexuals who want their opinions to be binding law,” he said.
The European Council said on Sunday that it was “suggest” because Poland was dissipating from the deal.
In Warsaw, on Friday, about 2,000 people protested, including women’s groups and other groups of rightholders, outside the offices of Ordo Luris, who support the country from the agreement.
“We won’t be victims,” they called.
It also appeared in other cities in Poland.
Poland signed the Istanbul Agreement on the Prevention and Combating Violence against Women and Home Violence in December 2012 and completed it in 2015.
Maurice Petty, a mechanical engineer at the Heiður Palace, died 81 years ago
KANSAS CITY, Kansas (AP) - Maurice Petty, who was part of the quarter-mile-accuracy campaign that includes his father Lee and his brother Richard, who was the first machine engineer to be taken into the Heiður Palace of Nascar, died on Saturday.
He was 81 years old.
Petty's family didn't give up his murder attempt.
It has not been reported to him.
While his other family members were quiet for their talents behind the steering wheel, Maurice Petty took the nickname “Snow” for his skills with the screw-flyer.
He helped his family win 198 racing and seven titles in the NASCAR, and also built machines that ensured the Healing Hall Company Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal and Pete Hamilton win.
“The stage was one of the most powerful engines in the history of NASCAR,” said Chairman and CEO Jim France.
“He came with the power that helped Petty Enterprises achieve their achievements in the field of sports.
Although Maurice was known for his work under the hood, he also enjoyed various roles behind the tents and did what needed to bring his car on the trail.”
Maurice Petty was born on March 27, 1939 in Level Cross, North Carolina.
He followed his father on the race track when he was small and his knowledge in the engine engine machine began to become a fast-paced participant in the landing of Lee Petty in 54 competitions and three championships.
He competed 26 times in the NASCAR Cups from 1960 to 1964, was seven times in the top five and 16 times in the top 10.
However, he quickly decided to focus on what happens under the machine life rather than behind the steering wheel, which proved a complete track for his older brother, who sat on his engines on his tour.
Richard, who was then called the "King", won the first championship with the Styra in 1964 with the Plymouth bifre.
They won again in 1967, so two years in 1970 and 1971, reaching three titles in addition to the decade before the end of the decade.
With these seven titles on the back, they split into the most numerous titles with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson.
“Maurice Petty was one of the design pioneers of NASCAR and was in his career at Petty Enterprises in building one of the top teams in NASCAR,” Winston Kelley said in a statement.
Petty’s winning score is recorded as 212 the number of his calls to over 250 wins, if taken with all the machines he designed for his competitors.
The horse will be remembered forever as the best machine in the history of NASCAR.”
Lee Petty died in 2000 and Patricia, wife of Maurice Petty, aged 52, died in 2014.
He was also a cousin of former driver and journalist Kyle Petty and Trent Owens, the team manager of the car competition.
“We now say Maurice Petty, one of the other designers and huge pioneers and heroes of NASCAR, will be his legacy and name stored in our memories, kept in the air and kept for all the future,” Kelley said.
“We send our deepest condolences to the Petty family.”

I want to thank every single fan for the support over the years, the club to give me the opportunity to be blue-dressed, and my teammates.
You will always have a place in my heart.

When he was released this morning, he refused to leave and reportedly returned to the police.

Military forces destroy camps and trap troops in Zamfara
Air forces such as the HADARIN DAJI operation were facing a thunderstorm of new military forces under the command of the so-called "Dangote" of the Doumborou Forest in Zamfara State.
John Enenche, a sub-committee and a representative of the defences, said that the air raid, which also fell several soldiers, had been carried out following the HUMINT investigation and the number of air-air traffic to confirm.
Enenche's chief executive said that the snow data had led to the fact that members of the band had been flying with a vista, a motorcycle, and hundreds of stolen cages of their previous residence on the new site of a rocky mountain inland inside the forest.
Enenche said that in the aftermath the air force had sent a special-strength band of fighters and armed helicopters from the Nigerian army to attack the area.

Serbia wants to increase the number of military aircraft in the Baltic Sea
BELGRAD, Serbia (AP) - Serbia will strengthen its army and seek to buy more aircraft for what the tensions are in the Balkans, said President Serbia on Sunday.
Aleksandra Vucic, president of the United States, said that “certain negotiations” were underway to purchase fleets of missiles, and the United States and other Western states accused the armed neighbouring states of Serbia that are in NATO, as well as Kasovó, who was previously here in Serbia.
“Bad soldiers, Turks and Germans think well about their love-loving explosion,” said Vucic, referring to Kósovó.
He said the U.S. had recently delivered a security team of Kósovó's numerous armored cars.
In a survey of the Serbian military, Vucic said his nation cannot compete with “produce NATO” to armed neighbors, and that “that’s why we’re up to ourselves.”
Vucic did not specify the type of military aircraft Serbia had to buy, but the media sidehole government says his government has publicly requested the delivery of 20 aircraft from the United States.
As a result, Washington’s response to the request from Belgrade is not confirmed and it is likely that it will be purchased as an attacker by the type of Sukhoi-25 from Russia.
Serbia, which continues a neutral policy in military policy, has recently obtained a sophisticated air-conditioning system from Russia, which has also provided anti-aircraft, attack helicopters and armor trucks.
China, which is also a federation of Serbia, has passed the kingdom's drones to be used in military operations.
U.S. officials have been discussing open-label sanctions against Serbia if more weapons are carried to the country from Moscow, especially weapons that could lead to security of neighboring NATO forces at risk.
In the West and the neighbouring countries of Serbia, people are looking at the threat of armed conflict between Russia and China in Serbia.
The tension now increases in the Balkans, but there was a human war in the 1990s.
The Atlantic Coast Guard had a transfer of Serbia to stop blood clotting operations of Serbia against Kósovó-Albana in 1999.
Despite formally seeking to go to the European Union, the pop-list of Serbia has strengthened even more political and military ties with the Kremlin and Beijing.
Serbia, as well as Russia and China, do not recognize the independence of Russia, which the United States and most Western countries have recognized.
Heart failure: The body of this deadly disease can decrease by eating chocolate once a week
A new study suggests that certain good qualities may be good for the heart muscle.
What is it? And how could it reduce the likelihood of a heart attack?
Scientists have made an analysis of coronary artery disease that covers more than five decades.
The main symptoms of coronary artery disease (also referred to as myocardial artery disease in the heart) are three: chest pain (heart tunnel), heart attack and heart failure.
Other symptoms may be heart palpitations and severe shortness of breath.
“The chocolate contains nutrients that are good for the heart, such as flavonide, methylxantine, polyphenol and sterinic acid, which can reduce inflammation and increase good cholesterol.”
Good cholesterol, which is also called high-density protein, accumulates ‘bad’ cholesterol — the type of cholesterol that slows the arteries of the heart — and flows it into the liver.
The cholesterol (low concentration protein) is broken down into the liver and then it is excreted from the body.
However, the new study does not determine the dosage or type of chocolate that is consumed.
It is not clear whether participants were eating dark chocolate, milk chocolate or any other chocolate.
The results were based on an older study that found that consumption of cocoa (which is found in chocolate) reduced the risk of heart attack.
Scientists believe that flavonide found in chocolate lower blood pressure and hypertension.
With vascular function, it refers to how well the blood distributes oxygen and nutrients to the body and flows waste from crime.
There was no evidence of lifestyle in the results of the new study.
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein said that those who had actually recognized that eating chocolates were more likely to be with a healthy body weight.
She added that they could exercise regularly and feel for less stress.
“Each of these factors could have an independent impact on the healthy heart and vascular system,” she added.
Coles is making plastic toys for books in a new collection campaign.
“We’ve really listened and that’s the key to the preparation of the project,” Ronson said.
“We don’t believe that people want to recycle books — we think it will have them, but it can reunite them at home if they want to.”
Ronson said the new campaign has been in operation long before COVID-19 came to the story and despite the danger, she believes that the timing of the new campaign has been “good” because of how much time parents are now defending with their children.
According to researchers, concerns have been raised as to the fact that consumers are tired of the continuous play collection campaigns of the biggest major markets, but Ronson says no sign of fatigue yet reached.
“We haven’t seen anything like this yet, but we’ve always got our eyes open,” she said.
“We have a lot of data, from week to week, month to month, to ensure that what we make from our customers is consistent.
It was Cloes who ran the track for collection campaigns on board the Little Shop in Australia, but the first of my year 2018 was the driving force behind the best annual sales market from the beginning.
Woolworths followed with Lion King Oosheis, who also helped his large-scale sales, and now the latest offers environmentally friendly promotional adventure Discovery Garden customers up to free herbs and flowers for planting.
However, the new collection campaign could have less impact this time as UBS branches forecast increased sales in large-scale Australia in the largest part of the 2021 financial year.
Ronson said customers can expect a variety of collection campaigns in the future and that campaigns such as Little Shop must all be rare.
“There’s a lot of gathering campaigns around the world that we look forward to and we’re constantly looking for inspiration from other countries,” she said.
“We need to do it to ensure that we make our customers better.”
I’ve been going to 5 circles around the country this summer.
The photographer and material producer Jón Ragnar Jónsson, often known as Jon From Iceland, has been more and less on the flag of Iceland since the World Heritage site.
Jón completed a thorough examination in business science at the University of Reykjavík a few years ago, but now he works to travel and produce marketing material for individuals and businesses.
The summer started early at Jóni, or in April, when he traveled across all the Westfjords and accommodations in his car.
It’s been about five or six calls around the country.
In addition, he has been on a busy day trip here and there.
What journey has gone out of?
“Somebody like me is always on the move and seeing everything, it’s hard to name a favorite place.
It’s more weather and the company that matters all the time.
I’ve recently had a lot of excitement since they opened in June.
They always stand up because there is so much adventure to get to the destination.
The last trip there is a possible favorite trip of the year, but we went 25 together in 5 large cars up in Fljótshlíð and the river Álftavnóttir.”
What’s ahead of you this summer?
“It’s very exciting for me in the next few years, but I’ve finished a training course with DIVE and now we’re taking the cruises here and around Iceland.
I had to add a tablet to my “detress” so I’d be more into the sea than before.
I’m going on a 10-day “solo” journey with everything I need behind it, but it comes in light later this summer.
Otherwise, I’ll be able to see the area all year round.”
What is your favorite place in Iceland?
“It’s always hard to choose one place, but the Christmas tree has been a part of my life since I remember.
The family went to every place in the area of Breiðamarksjökull, and then I’ve always been well in that area.
I think I can say that I’ve been there over 100 times.”
What place in Iceland do you recommend that people visit?
“I’m going to bring one pearl from each part of the country, but it’s: Málaga in the south, Stálagur in East Iceland, Aldjarfoss in northern Iceland, Rastaðasur in the Westfjords, Snæfellsjökull in West Iceland, and last but not last time...
What's wrong with the trip?
“I don’t go out on land unless I’m with the following in the car: Good flashlight, hanger, lopapysa, fishing jigsaws, annubs, refrigeratorbox and Æbits... those who know me know what I’m talking about.”
Search for 24 roses afraid of drowning from an island in Malaysia
KÚALA LÚMPÚR, Malaysia (AP) — The government of Malaysia said on Sunday that it was looking for 25 robbers who are afraid to have drowned after jumping off the boat from Langkawi, which is northern Malaysia.
Zawawi Abdullah, a senior official at the Malaysian Coast Guard, said the first information police showed that only one of the rebels 25 who had been killed by the boat had managed to swim to land.
The man who came to life sought help from police late on Saturday and has been detained while the matter has been investigated further, Zawawi said.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslims have fled Mjanmar because of military operations and many of them live in complex refugee camps in Banglades.
Muslims are the majority of people in Malaysia, who have been a long-standing destination of boats that promise refugees better life in another country.
Zawawi said two ships and aircraft were used in the search.
He said that the National Guard also remembers to make sailors in the area and the authorities in the neighbouring country of Thailand warned them that they can help with the search.
He did not provide any further information about the boat.
In the last month, the authorities of Malaysia pushed 269 sailors into custody and found bodies on board a boat that is suspected of being used for smuggling from the shores of Langkawi, but they asked him if he could not return to sea.
Malaysian authorities later said that individuals 269 had been transferred from larger ships with dozens of people thought to have died and that their bodies had been thrown into the sea.
The Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said that Malaysia could not accept any more robbers, as it violates the economic situation due to the coronavirus epidemic.
He said that those who are already in the country would not be sent back to sea.
In Malaysia, more than 2 million illegal immigrants live as well as more than 180,000 refugees and asylum seekers, including 101,000 refugees, who are registered at the United Nations Refugee Agency.
inhabitants of Aswan collect, guard, and return the farm of chocolate to Sudan by car
The ferry service on the way to Súdan with many tons of chocolate selected on the international road between Aswan and Abu Simple on Sunday, at the streetside of the village of Wadi Karkar, when the driver fell dead due to heat.
The villagers were grouped to help the driver where he borrowed and saved the warning that had been lost.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, described his position so that the driver had been “moving along the way to our village; we couldn’t just stand by.
We need to help people in need, no matter where it comes from.”
He added that the villagers had come to a ambulance to download the driver and then tried to save the cargo of the vehicle, which was rated at three million pounds.
Bahr said the villagers had been on the scene from the morning to the evening and saved as much of the cattle they could.
“What we found most important was to save the life of the driver, protect the father and open the international road again,” he said.
The villagers were willing to provide the slassed driver’s water and housewash, Bahr said, adding that they wanted only to make sure he came to and from the village unhappiness.
There was already a burglary in the Senate, but the Kurón road could make them worse.
“The world-famous one, and call upon our elected representative of the leadership and vision we are living in difficulties,” says a report released by Leonard Steinhorn, Professor of Communications at American University, and Mark Sobol, author and expert in planning and management.
“But we also stand before other liabilities that turn around our genetic nation and the racial heritage that has devastated our country from its establishment.”
In the study, knowledgeable content is passed in relation to the impeccable state of the Senate: a lack of real association between categories, a schedule that limits the opportunity for communication, too much coordination elected in leadership positions, a continuous demand for finance, a dispute between categories, negative impact media that is active throughout the day, the most important fact of the fact is the fact that the parties involved are often the most important parties to the meetings.
It is also noted that the Senate is getting more into the net world because of the world’s epidemic, where such a system, which allows elections with help from local representatives without the senators having to travel to Washington, could increase even the problems that exist.
If the idea of a remote meeting close to a foothold, it would be a serious backlash for experiments to increase communication between categories, that is, the report says.
“The World War II is forced to move most of its activities across the network and we certainly understand why,” the report said.
“But despite the need, it should not be interpreted as a virtue.”
The document states that the Senate needs “more than not less communication between the senators, face to face.”
They need to present an understanding of each other better, have courteous conversations to find a common flair and build a relationship based on trust that can lead to increased understanding and solutions."
This week, when Ted Yoho, a Republican from Florida, attacked Alexandriu Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, with his fellow Republicans and his associates in the Rebíblika group joining him to overthrow Liz Cheney.
President Val Demings is talking about the Vice Presidential Assembly, Trump is hearing it for grace.
The House of Demings (democrats, Florida) was not ashamed to discuss their interest in the opposition to the office of Vice-President Joe Biden and express sincere gratitude for being taken to the branch of office.
This respected member of the parliament group was interviewed by BlackPressUSA in a broadcast due to the #FIYAH! Live episode and told from his story, the orchestra and the commitment that has brought her to the place she is today, and started on the words - "You know all my story."
Demings was one of four U.S. Senators in the Criminal Court over Donald Trump in the Senate in January.
I wonder if President Trump will be listed in the story that he is the fourth president to be charged.
In an interview with the NPR of his office at Capitol Hill, after this former attorney-in-chief of the House of Representatives, he said, "Is this worth it? This has been worth every day."
She added that, despite the disappointments, they would have been required to follow the case regardless of their outcome.
In the interview, Demings made clear that she is opposed to Trump in the prison sentence of Rogers Stone, convicted of lying before the Senate (out of other crimes) who reached his presence on other criminals convicted of a similar crime, she said, “The lack of innocence to reach your friends, those who have lied and cheated.”
Deamings is at the top of Joe Biden's list of potential candidates for the Vice President, who also holds Karen Bass Chairman CBC (democrats, California), Stacey Abrams' former Speaker of Georgia, Kamölu Harris (democrats, California), and Tammy Duckworth (demótarakis)
However, she decided that only one person would decide who was going on with Joe Biden in the fall.
“That’s Joe Biden.”
Then she put her hand on her mouth while she laughed and wondered that those who looked at the direct broadcast and added, “If you want to call, you can do it for me.”
There is no doubt that regardless of the political statements of what will become in the history books, this period is considered as a time when the development of American politics and attitudes.
This did not happen with Demings.
It reminded us that how many women come to the branch for the offer of the United States of America is the opportunity to break through what is left of the "grey" - especially for women of African origin.
“It’s exactly this opportunity I win so hard that I have my whole life to create for young boys and girls who have heard that their color is wrong, that they don’t have enough money or that they’re out of wrong sex,” she said.
The House of Representatives is committed to ensuring that the Democratic Party and the National Assembly of Biden would advertise and work with the Black Press of America to get as many people to vote as possible.
“I’ll call Tom Perez (president of the Democratic Party) and I’ll put this at the top of the list with me,” Demings said.
She agreed that this had to happen more than later in the election.
When she answered former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that Trump could refuse to leave the White House, he lost the election, and another editor, who says the president is preparing to reach himself, suffered from Demings: “As much as stinging up on reaching himself, let me be left unbelievably.”
“But who would ever do it other than Trump?
I think he hated this job.
It should not be possible to break the law and ignore the Constitution in this work.
I think he hated the job, but he doesn’t like to lose.
I can honestly believe that the president will not want to leave the White House, but we have our ways to see about it, and if that happens, I just want to be with those in the team who make it happen.”
Obesity in the foot for children
There are girls for the children who want to cook with their parents from a young age in bottles that fit the table in better days.
There are probably some parents who celebrate — or the parents who have been given a way to the children’s girls with decorations.
However, there are not the children who are being brought to their parents, because they are more excited to see their feet.
We are talking about this inflatable ripple on the modernhouseessentials.com website that stores various gold molars.
The bottles have good legs, stable feet and resistant well-heated heat - so kids can enjoy the pans whether it is hot or cold.
Each glass is about 150 ml.
Those who want to look at the bottle further can check in to the HÉR website, but the bottles are available these days on small 3,400 crowns of Icelandic.

New York City’s full-fledged New York citizen says it’s “reasonable” to separate a white firefighter from an honorary award.
A full-fledged author of the New York City television series said it would be “reasonable” to keep white firefighters from honorary price to get immigrants can all be black, according to new news.
White firefighter Daniel McWilliams has appealed for discrimination because of racial discrimination after he was taken from a group of small mobs in November 2017 to commemorate the fall of members of the Vulcan Society, who are brothers of black firefighters.
The main representative of the ceasefire in the field of diversity and accessibility, lawyer Cecilia Loving, was still the decision of the New York City Human Rights Court.
McWilliams is one of the three firefighters of the department, who, on a historical picture, sees the U.S. flags at Ground Zero on the scenes after the September 11 attacks.
According to McWilliams, the crew of the firefighter had chosen him to be one of the few in honor of the memorial crew.
Being a prisoner at this event was “a great honor and privilege” for McWilliams, because it is presented in the legal application under CNN.
However, when he was able to attend the event, he was meant to participate in the honorary award of the then President of the Vulcan Society, Regin Wilson, because she had been told that all the prisoners of the Mass would be black.
She then asked McWilliams, a 29-year-old employee of the New York City Fire Department, to help in a different way.
Amongst the things she has asked him to do is to provide unbeaten cities accompanied and adjust the characteristics of the veiled firefighters up the distance from the brass.
McWilliam's statement in his legal application that he asked Wilson whether he was taking him out of the honor because he was not black.
She confirmed that it was so, he said.
Wilson, who has been working on the firearm of New York City for 21 years and who also participated in the September 11 rescue work, will have replaced McWilliams for one of the members of the Vulcan Society.
McWilliam’s statement that he has left the memorial port “to guard for further shame, humiliation and a little bit,” is friends and colleagues heard what went between them, according to the New York Daily News.
When the Law, which is black, testified before the court, asked lawyer McWilliams, Keith Sullivan, that the following: “So that asking everyone to be black in honor is not a difference?”
“No, it’s not,” said Lawing, according to the New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Loving if it would be okay to ask everyone to be black in honor, which she replied: “Of course.”
Law explained that it would be okay to replace a white person out for a black person to “reveal our specialty and different origins to create proud, cohesive and support for each other.”
McWilliams first presented a love of discrimination from a gang of the New York City firefighters in January 2018.
He then made a lawsuit against Wilson, the New York City, New York City, and unelected individuals in May 2019.
Sullivan said that after McWilliams put forward his boyfriend, supporters Wilson had revenged him and threatened him.
At one point, one of her supporters will have laid hands on McWilliams and said, "I've heard of you, they told me you'd profit you like this, and now you know who I am."
Meanwhile, Sullivan wrote that it would have been “surprising” to exclude McWilliams from the honors of the princess and sign that one didn’t care about all of the firearms.
“If you’re a black person and you don’t have a white person at work, you’ll get the best reminder,” Sullivan said.
Wilson received the law “advocation for one hour” because of her treatment at McWilliams.
Meanwhile, a white person who misunderstands a black person’s “harmful punishment,” wrote Sullivan.
“The love of New York City has created a strategy and process designed to please members of the Vulcan Society, who behave with racial means, excuse their actions, and their teammates ... and this has to stop,” wrote Sullivan.

Thousands of people in Khabarovsk demand the release of Putín
Thousands of citizens clashed with the Russian city of Khabarovsk yesterday, protesting the arrest of the governor of the province in the North East of Russia and his inauguration, which has never lived in the province.
Former governor Sergei Furgal, a new great popular and dozens of thousands of citizens protested when he was arrested and taken to prison in Moscow earlier this month, charged with the murder of three merchants five years ago.
In the new week, Furgal was formally appointed as the governor and 39-year-old of his classmates, Mikhail Degtyarev, appointed in his place, with little interest in the home.
Is Degtaryev said unfavorable and, what is worse, without any links with Khabarovsk and called citizens after his resignation as soon as possible.
They call it Degtaryev as wind of ears.
Yesterday's respondents were small fewer than in the first protests, or fifteen to twenty thousand, and the demands were the same as before: Freedom of Furgals and the resignation of Vladimir Putin, Russia's president.
"We want the governor to be released, because we think his arrest is likely to be illegal," the AFP court said after a half-hour protester, Alin Slepovu.
She stated that the representatives of the Kremlin had left Furgal to defend their own interests, but not the interests of the region."
The police in Khabarovsk left protests unharmed despite the imminent violation of the law by the Kóravirus epidemic.
In Moscow, the police arrested at least ten people who came together at Pushkin Square to show protesters in Khabarovsk support for work, according to the Guardian news.
The category Furgals, the Free radical democracy of Russia, is a party of the nationalists, and is of the political figures of the Kremlin government in most cases.
The BBC also informed the BBC, however, that the victory of Furgals in the presidential elections two years ago — which was a great and unconformity — had been a significant fall for Putin and the united Russia, and although it points out that the conflict between the Kremlins in the eastern region was to be weakened.
Furgal was arrested on July 9 and moved to Moscow where he was awaiting trial.
He has been charged with three murders in 2004 and 2005.
Two of them were in front, but the third one went out about you.
Sarah Rainsford, a BBC reporter in Moscow, says followers of Furgals, who enjoy great popularity at home, convinced that the prosecutor and the arrest have no political roots.
They want to know why the government had asked him to arrest him until now, says Rainsford, 15 years after his intended break.
Three branches made their way over South Texas.
The filibly Hanna fell down into strength heatlift storms after he landed on the south coast of Texas on Saturday, July 25, but the government warned that the storm could still cause human casualties.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture said the huge drop would be the greatest threat in southern Texas and the northeastern Mexico after what was left to the west coast on Sunday.
Jorge Castillo shared this video on Twitter and told Storyful that he had taken it outside his home in Combes, Texas on Sunday morning.
Homeless women with clothing participate in the fight against COVID-19 in Chennai
Shanthi, a dressed woman who is educated as a dresser, visits 250 homes every day to identify people with symptoms in Koambakkam, much Covid territory in Chennai, where about 10,000 cases have been reported.
The working day starts early at 7:30 p.m. and ends at 16 p.m.
She recommends the temperature of the inhabitants, asks for signs and physics about the importance of using masks, wash her hands regularly and keep away from others.
Her work has more to say to diagnose and treat infection in a timely manner in four positive individuals.
Shanthi is one of 16,000 Chennai citizens who own their homes but are not health professionals.
The project has reportedly led to a reduction in positive cases by 50 percent, in today's population of Chennai, while increasing in other provinces of Tamil Nadu.
Shanthi says that not all people are co-operating.
She added: “People are co-operative when a woman with a baby is approaching them.
Some people will be pissed off.
This is not to worry about.
I think people should be safe.
When I come back the next day, the people are cured.
It helps build a good relationship.”
And there are more women like Shanthi who dwell in the gistyl city for women with clothing and put the fight against the Covid-19 team.
Not far from Komambakkam, Kavitha, who also has a clotheswear, also participates in the action of a manager.
Although Kavitha doesn’t have a bike, she’s going to meet people and keeps on her heels.
“I’m happy,” she says about the decrease in infection, but adds: “I want to see them go down to maybe 100 a day.
I'm sure we can get it."
At the first floor of the glisty where the two live are Matilda Funceca, a basketball woman who uses a wheelchair, and Manimekalai who is a teacher, and they send all the data from about 40 women into a web server Chennai citizen.
Matilda is not afraid to be infected by the coronavirus.
“When we help others protect us,” she adds.
When Manimekalai is asked what measures she does, she says: “I use a mask, hold away and wash my hands often.
I also drink Kabbasura Kudineer, siddha-dicking that promotes the immune system."
A few months ago, when the coroner fought first to Chennai, these dressed women cared for their time and skills in sage monsters for health professionals in the city.
Aishwarya Rao doctor and controller of the glistin, as well as the Dorcas Research Center operating the cloud, says: “They are designed to meet every moment.
Before they needed a mask and they didn’t leave behind.
Now they come to the community and they answered the call.”
The virus virus target in Tamil Nadu has now become 200,000 after 6989 new cases in the past 24 hours, but it is also the largest number of infections detected in one day, according to official data.
Eighty-nine people have died and 7758 have been in the team for 24 hours.
The total number of infections in the state is 206,737.
Police are trying to get to the last trip of a teenager in Helensburgh
Researchers investigating the death of a teenager in Helensburgh are now trying to put together a timeline over his last trip.
Like the 19-year-old Kirk Allan was found at Johnson Court at 06:25 on Saturday.
A 30-year-old man was arrested and the police confirmed on Sunday that he had been charged with the death.
He will be right in Dumbarton on Monday.

Police will continue to work with society and provide support.
Our research continues to get a full picture of what took place, especially the visits of the Church in the last days of his death, but we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the death sentence.”
South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox say their experience of discrimination
The last few weeks have become clear that many bones are still in the closet in connection with racial sports in South Africa.
Building conversations need to take place and take action to ensure that everyone is welcome in sports.
Ashwell Prince, the former prominent star of Proteas, allowed his white former team members to hear it and then sued them for racialism by saying he and other black players to be “women.”
Prince said Black players Proteas has been officially called “women” by their white team members.
He added that it would be sad that even though black players like Makhaya Ntini and now Kassso Rabada got the top goals in the sport associated with some people even with the polls.
Prince, who is now a coach of the Cape Cobras team, allowed this bill to fall on the United Coalition for Sport and Community Based Organizations (UCSCBO) on Thursday night.
The goal of the talks is to continue the ancient debate on the historical racial rights of South African sports.
“As well as I said when I eased myself on social media, it’s not my intention to come and draw people’s names down to sleep, but these are real events.
“You’re doing everything right as well.”
Paul Roberts, a former musician, and a publisher who became a NASA programmer, is now working on a software company.
He and his wife, a former nurse at the Methodist Hospital who looks at himself as a visionary, held an outdoor interest in the online casino and attended Comic Con events earlier in years.
Once a week, they pounce with their two daughters, connected vision and 7-year-old grandchildren and play the Uno games.
“They are incredibly nerdy,” says Roman, 38 years old, about her parents.
Sheryl Roberts, aged 65, is aware of the dangers of the world’s disease — she has diabetes, asthma and heart disease that can put her at an increased risk.
Her husband has a chronic lung disease and a stint that keeps her before a rigid skull open.
"We've been so careful, very careful, and keep us away from people," Sheryl Roberts said.
Her husband started working at home in spring, when the farm ravaged Washington, New York, and other areas around the country.
Paul has repeatedly been on the market for “old-males” and their only real date of dating over the past month was according to Sheryl when they went to see wild whales through the car window.
Her younger daughter was also very careful.
Then she came home from work one day in mid-June and thought she was allergic.
Soon she got cough, fever, headache and diarrhoea, and lost all taste and smell, which is a typical symptom of the coronavirus.
“She said, ‘I don’t know what’s going on, Mom, but I had a mask, was wearing gloves, washing my hands,’ Sheryl said.
“You’re doing everything right as well.”
Elaine Roberts, who was diagnosed with a positive coronavirus infection, did not become seriously ill.
The situation was worse with her parents.
Paul Roberts and his wife started to lean and then the next cough, just like their daughter, and got so much heat and great pain in the body.
Then he became “a very weak, quite quickly,” Sheryl Roberts said.
On 22 June he was ringed.
She was worried about the oxygen level.
It was low, and she asked her older daughter to go with him on an emergency, for the second time in two days.
The Royal couple earlier found it to be “humid” in the Queen’s Christmas speech, according to a new book
MEGHAN Markle and Harry Bretaprins found his grandmother, Bretadrotling, have “hunged” them in his Christmas speech.
In a new life story of the couple, “Finding Freedom,” it appears that they were seen in the library that saw power in the Christmas talk.
Photos on the desk of the queen, including William Bretaprins, Kate Middleton, and their three children, Charles Bretaprins and his wife Kamillu, as well as Philip Prince.
But Meghan and Harry were nowhere to see despite Archie's birth in May, although it was mentioned by the boy as "the youngest child" of her Majesty.
In the new book, which comes out in August, Meghan and Kate Middleton also appear to “never be friends” where they “do hard to get over the superficial cure” and met only a few times.
Yesterday, Harry and William's brother had died a few years before his relationship and Meghan began, but it reached a peak due to the marriage of William and Kate Middleton.
The Duke of Sussex found him to be “varicious” at events with his brother and Kate Middleton, and it is believed that “he wanted to change the things long before Meghan came to the story.”
The Senators of the National Assembly will take the lead in wanting to keep public employees “home for ever.”
The Senators of the National Assembly will take action to want public employees to be “home forever,” after the leaders protested Boris Johnson that people returned to work.
The job leaders were accused of wanting employees to “at home forever” after they protested Boris Johnson’s call for people to return to work.
The members of the General Assembly were forced to return to their workplace when the workers’ public and public employees said their associates were asking their feet when their superiors ordered them to return to their workplace.
Andrew Percy, former prime minister, said it “unsustainable” that the necessary public service as a version of passports would stop while employees in the public market had worked hard to keep the community moving into the coronavirus age.
“It is impossible for people to return to work while workers in warehouses and factories around the country have continued to work to make public employees eat while at this stage,” he said.
“Many of these employees now want to go on holiday but can’t because of the people who refuse to go back to their workplace, even if it’s safe.
Realizing leaders cannot maintain this policy to stay home forever - especially now when we know that people can return to work with a safe way."
After calling for the Prime Minister last week, Alex Chisholm, a newly appointed official official service, announced that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should “resource employees in public service from their homes and accelerate their return to their workplace until August 1st.”
The company’s public and public employees expressed their associates, who count about 200,000 people, that they would not have to face this requirement, and said this is about policing.
The spokesperson of the public and public employees, the largest public sector official in the UK, said that the claim to return to work was “not seen with the health and safety of our members in front of us, or to strengthen the economy.”
This is the only decision made because of political pressure from the members of the General Assembly that requires public service to be used as an example to get others back to work.
Our advice to members is clear: if you do your jobs at home and someone in your department asks you to come back to work, do not take what you need to do.”
Deiluna can be traced to a growing inconvenience with delayed issuance of passports because employees work at home, but about 40,000 people are now waiting for their application.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now announced that it will “research” applications from the UK due to travel in the next two weeks, and from those who have been waiting for a visa release for more than four weeks.
Public and public employees have acknowledged that some have had to wait for up to 143 days after passports, but they insist that “liter and often narrow offices” make 4,000 employees of the passport service difficult to maintain a necessary distance.
Former Prime Minister David Davis, urged the leaders of the working community to “have reasonable” and seek guidance in cooperation with the government to bring people back to their workplace.
He added that if he were in the government, he would ask a lawyer: “What do you want people to be at home all summer?”
However, the UK’s largest company has also attracted Johnson to people’s return to work.
Research into larger workplaces with a total of 40,000 employees revealed that only 40,000 of them have returned to their workplace.
The importance of the story can play an important role.
The grass has spread, but understanding and sweetness should be the goal.
The school system is part of learning about this knowledge and understanding card.
Too little is taught by Australian history.
The fact is that without radical action, the only teaching branch that specifically deals with our story — “Saga Australia” for the 12th grade — will die out within the next five years or even sooner.
In the last year only 628 students in the Victorian State met in the history of Australia at a total of 49,324 as a luku primary school, or only 1%.
Over the last six years, this number has almost decreased by half, but nearly 100 fewer students are enrolled in the course each year.
The main reason why so few students choose to learn about the history of Australia in the 12th grade is that little has been done in previous years to interest them.
History is not even a unique field of study, but it falls under the wider “scientific.”
Therefore, students in 7th and 8th grade only complete one short unit of “space building and island biking on Torres Sound and their culture.”
9th and 10th year is another unit of Australia in the world.
For many students in Victoria, this is all that is taught about the history of Australia at the elementary schools.
In 9th and 10th year, another optional unit is in the period 1750-1918.
There are three actions to save Australian history in the schools of Victoria.
First of all, it needs to be said that independent science such as English, mathematics, and science must be developed.
Since history is only known as part of the mindset, it has little space in the textbook.
She is usually taught by people who have general education within the mind, but have not studied in science.
A theoretical approach to the analysis of information is complex.
We need to employ more specialized scientists to ensure that such skills are characterized in an accessible and exciting way.
Third, the history of Australia from 1788 to 1914 is to be a matter of urgency.
Students can appreciate what they know.
So many of my former students chose not to learn the history of Australia in the 12th year of study because they had to learn the material from reason.
Knowledge of the story is one and does not make a deep difference between race.
But without her, as clearly seen in the Victorian language, the project is hopeless.

Aron Elís in a review of the European Court of Justice - Isaac divided by a field in half
Aron Elís Tvernson has come to an end to the European Football Championships.
Isaac Bergmann Johnson played only the first half with the top team Norrköping against Falkenberg in Sweden.
Aaron Elís was a team member of the OB in Denmark when the team went on to win the European Championship.
OB will meet AGF or FC Köbenhavn at the final stage, but it depends on whether the teams end after the final round of the top part of the Danish election later today.
Aaron Elís played the whole game in a 1 to 1 equal match with Horsens at the outdoors today, but OB had won the first game of the team at home, 3-1, and won a total of 4-2.
Isaac was at the start of Norrköping, which was unexpected 2-1 after the first half against Falkenberg in the Swedish Premier League.
Norrköping made a triple split at the beginning of the second half and was Isaac one of those who had to go.
Norrköping achieved a total of 3 to 2 in 89 minutes.
However, it was time for Norrköping to recover from the scene at the last moment, 3-3.
Norrköping is on the top, with 24 points, four points ahead of Elfsborg and five points ahead of Malmö which play well later today.
The ladder turned Falkenberg to get off the bottom of the car, but the team is level above Helsingborg and Kalmar who have a game for good.
Collecting the National Day of the Co-Corrovirus
Anna Lilja Sigurdóttir founded the Facebook group “My 2020 festival” to gather sources of the national festival that the Eyjaans are going to hold next weekend.
Many are going to camp in their tents and rejoice with friends and relatives.
Anna Lilja was talking to the Whale in the episode Helgi on the Byljugn.
“There’s nothing going on yet that’s very exciting as well because there are 600 people coming to the group so that men are clearly going to do something,” Anna Lilja said.
There’s something to be done with a campground at home in the garden.
“But we’ve talked about being with our own people, sitting in the garden and meeting the family as men always do at this time,” says Anna.
“I think people will spend time with their people.
It is likely that many people will not be in the place, but to hold some national celebration somewhere else.”
The National Committee is now working hard to repay the tickets purchased, but Anna thinks many homeowners are going to rather secure tickets at the festival next year.
“It’s even worth investing in the tickets and allowing for 2021.”
“I’m a great nationalist, love the preparation and everything about this, but sometimes something comes into life that you don’t control the road and that’s just that,” says Anna, who says a little bit about people asking if they can’t let the National holiday “even once.”
Anna Lilja says he has not established the group for himself or to encourage people to celebrate his own National Festival, but to gather sources of the World Heritage Festivals in Eyum this year.
“What did people do in this strange time?
I’m not going to use this for one thing or anything, but I’m going to tell anyone who uses such sources in something but I was just creating something where people can put in what it’s doing.”
It has also been re-loaded on a Christmas tree that has been turned off every year.
“I think many people are excited to burn on Friday night.
The only thing that is, of course, in the account is that the prediction is not a matter.
“There will be a fire in this fire, but it just needs to be revealed how it will be,” Anna Lilja said.

Will André's Prince be named in a new case of sexual abuse?
The British royal family is now in a position to respond to possible new information in court discussions about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.
U.S. judges have ordered secret documents about Epstein and Maxwell to be made public
Among those found in these 80 pages of documents are parts with testimony Maxwell from the year 2016
Birting these times could also put a lot of pressure on Andrés Prince, where they find communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015
Virginia Roberts, an American actress, said in 2015 that she had been forced to co-operate with Andrés Prince.
Andrés Prince is now in charge of defending the possible publication of information this week with still harmful excuses for his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and his supposed scientist, Ghislaine Maxwell.
The American District Court judge Loretta Preska was appointed this week for the publication of 80 secret legal documents in connection with Maxwell and Epstein, which count hundreds of journals.
Birding these enormously extensive documents would be the case for the 58-year-old Maxwell, where they have kept a large part of her testimony in front of lawyers in 2016, including what her lawyers have said to be “a frequent question” about her sex story.
They could also put a great deal of pressure on Andrés Prince, where one document contains communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts, a relatively small American financial officer, claimed in 2015 that she had been three times forced to co-operate with Andrés.
Andrés has repeatedly rejected this statement.
Emails from the year 2015 that have been leaked and the BBC published last year seem to indicate that Andrés had asked Maxwell for help in responding to Roberts’ claims.
We have no doubt that the military will have a rebellion.
He said: “Let me know when we can talk. Is there a specific question I need to ask you about Virgini Roberts.”
Maxwell replied, “I have information. Call me when you have a free time.”
Andrési said last night: “The hero of Jórvík has done nothing wrong, and therefore we do not worry about the opening of the courthouse.
As the U.S. courts have pointed out, this does not mean that the excuse is true, even if it comes to justice.
U.S. courts have encouraged media and public authorities to take care of the utmost precautions to be taken in the treatment of cases that occur in the courts.
We totally agree.
We have no doubt that the military will have a full revolt over the next few weeks.”
Maxwell is now in custody in Manhattan and is awaiting trial for finding and counting some of the victims of Epstein who were under the law from 1994 to 1997.
She is also accused of denying testimony about her abuse.
She rejects all the excuses.
Maxwell last spoke to lawyers in April and July 2016 in connection with the death sentence of Roberts, who is now under the surname of Giufre, who she retired after marriage.
About 40 pages of all 418 with the testimony were made public last year, but after the resignation of Presna in New York last week, more parts could be opened in the first place on Thursday.
Maxwell’s lawyers had one week to submit a petition.
Epstein was found dead in his prison room in New York City last year, he was accused of sexual offences.
Police search for crime by violent attack on streets of Edinburgh
Three men in Edinburgh attacked a man who could prove permanent.
The victim, who was 29 years old, was at Drum Street in Gilmerton, between 23:00 and 23:30 on Saturday.
The Scottish police reported that he had been taken to the Royal Hospital with serious injury.
Police spokesman Dale Miles, who controlled the study, said: “This was a violent and extraordinary attack.”
The others suspected of flying to Newtoft Street.
One of them was counted on the river age, about 180 cm on the floor and strong wax.
He was short-cut and dark-haired in white balls, dark pants and dark shoes.
The Miles investigation officer said: “I ask everyone who was in this area when the attack was done and saw something suspicious about giving up.”
The ambassador wants to carry a gun in Iceland
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, the U.S. ambassador to Iceland, wants to carry a gun in the country and want to increase security care.
He was said to have been “worst” about his safety since he came to the country last year.
This is reflected in CBS, which also says that it wants Gunter, despite the fact that he works in “the safest state of the world.”
Gunter is said to have asked the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs to get rid of the Icelandic government that he may carry a gun.
He has asked for a broken car and a vest that will guard him against a knife knife.
CBS’s officials have reported that Gunter is not at risk in Iceland.
According to CBS, the Foreign Ministry of Iceland has not provided information on whether the request has been drilled from the United States for possible Gunter weapons, because the authorities do not comment on the security of foreign nationals.
Officials say that no request has been made.
In addition, CBS has also said that Gunter had said that he should not be sought to carry weapons, because it would be taken as an insult to this country.
Gunter is an experienced scientist, but he has been a skin surgeon in California for over a year.
He is a former Vice President of the United States and a major supporter of Donald Trump.
He drew attention on this land when he was referring to the “Co-Australian People’s Republic of China.”
CBS officials also said Gunter had been seriously down on the U.S. Embassy in Reykjavík.
He has already had seven other employees in the embassy since May of last year.
He has, among other things, accused them of belonging to the “Deep State” so-called, who must be a network of U.S. officials working against Trump, and failed to get angry that one wore snow into his office.
The ambassador went to Washington DC in February and refused to return to Iceland for a few months, according to CBS.
Gunter is said to have wanted to work from California but to end, Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State, had to ship him back and did so in May.
The game form is key to Jose Mourinho, who says Tottenham has a simpler game in the future when supporters get to meet back on games
With the help of Jose Mourinho, Tottenham Hotspur has not lost a game at home since the election team returned, but he says that it will be easier to maintain a good exchange at home for if viewers were at stake.
Spurs has won 12 wins at home at this time, but lost four times — only one of the six teams above them has lost more at home.
The coach Portuguese said that although such a victory was possible without the fans, it would be easier to maintain it if they were in the place.
“We have to do this with the fans. Without them, you can build some kind of work, where the game plan is in the foreground,” he said.
“But I think it would be more powerful to do it with the fans, because then it was brought to the emotional side of the game, which is only next with the help of fans at the home stage.”
Mourinho believes that with stronger competitors, it will be increasingly difficult to maintain the long-running periods at home that he knows from Chelsea, or that Liverpool has built over the past three seasons.
But this is also key in determining whether the team achieves its goals at the end of the season, especially in the equation of games and neighbourhood laws, where the atmosphere of well-being can be divided into stages.
“I think the direction of the election is now becoming increasingly difficult to beat this inevitable goal, because what the team is doing is good.”
“Sometimes it’s important to be strong at home and at the end of the season, we’ve got a lot of points with wins in home games.”
“I’m happy with the results from home games last year, without the fans, but we need to get them back.
I'm looking forward to winning Arsenal with the area full of Tottenham fans.
“It’s a feeling that’s built small and small.”
Buyers are excited for the lifestyle benefits of Lovely Banks
“Greater is better,” is clearly the counter-terrorism of new owners of the huge property in the neighborhood of Lovely Banks, which sold at 1270 Australian dollars.
Interesting buyers in search of a lifestyle estate near the center of Geelong fled to explore this 1,35 hectares of landownership, where there can be a car accident for 14 cars, swimming pools and views of the Corio mountains.
Joe Grigic, a real estate agency in Harcourts, North Korea, said that offers in the country's territory that Cuddhy Court 1 had been approved within 10 days from the time it was placed on the market.
Broome Cottage in Ocean Grove Back to Sale
Home options for insulation
“We received a number of offers from various parties,” Grgic said.
“The company was sold to a homeowner who is very excited.”
The property comes with four rooms housed on two floors, including a private room that is large enough to accommodate sofas.
New owners have a choice of three living rooms and can enjoy a heated kitchen and heated outdoor area with views of the swimming pool.
“It was about how the property was combined, that it was three miles, and that it was in this place,” Grigic said.
“The city came interested buyers from Melbourne who were surprised at what the property was in the middle of the area, but also with a weld.
“I have people who lost and the buyers are still looking for.”
He said that the bedded storage area, which includes a double car garage and a free-standing cloud that accommodates 10-12 vehicles, was perfect for industrials or to store caravans and trailers.
Telji's security threat in Iceland
“It’s been named as the safest country in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been armed with his safety since he came to Reykjavík last year.”
This is how CBS News discusses U.S. ambassadors in Iceland, but this army has numerous sources of CBS from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
In CBS, it is announced that Gunter had requested the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs that he would be offered a special license to the Icelandic government to carry a gun.
He also wants to have a broken car, as well as the idea of the West that could warn him of a knife attack.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs refused to publicly state whether the security of Gunters is truly threatened in Iceland, but according to information from officials, Gunter has been told that he is in no particular danger.
Despite the recent U.S. embassy in Iceland after life warnings in full employment, including in the morning paper on 18 July, CBS announced it was made to see concerns Gunter.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs does not express its views on the safety measures associated with its embassy, but it always says that safety is safe by means of preventive measures.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs does not answer questions asked by the Foreign Affairs Council that the armed forces and the Icelandic Foreign Ministry do not want to say whether the U.S. has formally requested that the ambassador be able to carry a firearm, and is not usually expressed as a security issue.
CBS, however, has announced that its request for the material had never been made, and according to three U.S. officials, Gunter was imprisoned above this plan, where they could be insulting homeowners in Iceland.
CBS has also discussed the various issues of the US Embassy in Iceland since Gunter was sent to the ambassador last year, but he will have already replaced his deputy seven times.
Thus, the first vice-president has been preparing for a long time for his work and taught Icelandic only to have been denied the status of the last moments because Gunter “does not meet on him” at their first meeting.
His followers have not gone much better under Gunters' control.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs is aware of the status of the embassy in Iceland, but three are required to intervene in matters related to the president’s close prayer.
In addition to all of this, Gunter is asked to follow the various rules of the Foreign Service and respect the election order.
Gutner traveled to the United States in February to participate in a conference in Washington, and is said to have refused to return to Iceland after a while and let his local time go for his work so months, and that in the middle of the world.
Will Gunter even wanted to get his job in remote work and will not be told to return to Iceland unless the Minister of Foreign Affairs himself, Mike Pompeo, wanted to do so specifically.
According to information from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs, Gunter had decided to take a personal permit to close the conference and the crown virus virus virus probe for his rather than, but according to CBS, many people within the Council of Ministers will have asked Gunter to return to Iceland, but he did not make it until May, following Pompeo's return to contact and asked him to return to Iceland.
CBS has also reported enemies of Gunters in Iceland, especially in the context of which he calls the coronavirus — the anti-virus virus of China and has received great criticism.
Gunter is one of several, almost inexplicable in the field of foreign affairs ambassadors who have served as President of the United States Donald Trump.
The Sachin Pilot against Ashok Gehlot; Bharatiya Janata party says the board of directors of the state; the Congress Party wants to vote
Ashok Gehlot said that if it had to happen, the Congress would need to put a seat on the House of Representatives outside the Prime Minister's home.
On Saturday, the day after peaceful protests at Raj Bhawan in Jaipur, Ashok Gehlot, the prime minister of Rajasthan, said that if needed, the Senators of the Congress would meet the president and the chemical of the seat of the House of Representatives to bring the crown into the state to smell.
At the meeting of the Congressional Party, Gehlot announced that it was intended to hold a vote to check whether the majority of the members of the House and the members of the Senate were in the election.
"He said the government has a majority and wants to go to a vote," said Mahesh Joshi, the head of the congressional party after the meeting.
The meeting was held in a hotel where the senators who supported Gehlot have remained in the last few days.
“The Secretary of State asked us to stay in the hotel longer.
If so, he said, he would find the president and also hold peaceful protests outside the home Prime Minister's office," said the party leader.
The Prime Minister Rajasthan may call the parliament together and allow the Congress Party to show itself to its majority, said Rahul Gandhi's party leader on Friday, indicating that it had come up with the administration of the Bharatiya Janata Party to overthrow the government of Ashok Gehlot.
“The law is now governed by law and regulation.
Governments are filmed and worked with the people’s representatives.
Bharatiya Janata has come up with the government of Rajasthan.
This is an estimated $80 million in the population of Rajasthan.
The prime minister must call the parliament together to make the truth come out of the country," Gandhi said in a statement.
Ashok Gehlot, Prime Minister Rajasthan, said on Saturday that he was ready to attend the meeting of the President of India to ensure that what he calls “restricted Bharatiya Janata” is not a matter of trust.
Gehlot, who protested for many hours at the House of Governors Kalraj Mishra on Friday to press the meeting, meeting with the Congressional and Government of the Congress on Saturday and after the meeting, was a new proposal for a resolution and approved by the Government.
Mishra asked Gehlot last night to put the Senate back in and ran for six breaths.
The permit will be sent to the governor soon.
Gehlot has accused the governor of serving as the President of the House of Representatives, where he is “a pressure of pressure” to serve for the vote of the General Assembly, which is based on trust in his government.
When Gehlot met with the government, the Ambassador of Bharatiya Janata was appointed leader of Satish Poonia and leader of the cabinet of Gulab Chandra Kataria with the head of state to discuss the position of COVID-19 in the state.
Car crash right outside Borgarnes
He had to drive when he was driving in a car right above the golf course of Hamar at Borgarnes, right at 4 o'clock.
According to the fire in Borgarnes, the fire broke out in the car and is now waiting for him to be removed.
Two were in the car when the fire exploded because of the technology of car cars, both of which are full of hoods and completely inconvenient.
The control required traffic while the fire extinguisher was standing, but heavy traffic is in the area in both directions.
Actor Spencer Grammer given a cut outside Manhattan's restaurant
NEW YORK - Actor Spencer Grammar said he was trying to calm a man's arms and put his friend in the back outside the restaurant in New York City last Friday.
Grammer, aged 36, said US Weekly that she and her friend had done what everyone else had done in the same situation, and that they had been trying to prevent the situation from getting worse when they were told.
Grammar and her 32-year-old friend saw sneaking at the outdoor table at The Black Ant in East Village district Manhattan at 23:30
On Friday when a man went up to them and demanded to get a refund, but it was closed at the restaurant.
Grammar and her friend were injured when they tried to “disappear from a dispute between the unknown man and other guests in the place,” according to police.
The man ran away from the place after having injured his right arm Grammer and stabbed her friend in the box with unknown odds, the police said.
No one has been arrested.
Grammar, who speaks for Summer in the series “Rick and Morty” and previously played on ABC Family, is the daughter of the “Frasier” star Kelsey Grammar and the actress Doreen Alderman.
He said that both she and her friend were expecting to get her soon.
Neither of them suffered serious internal damage, she said.
In a statement to the US Weekly, Grammar thanked those who used the platform and staff of the Bellevue Hospital who were listening to them and reminded of the “a remarkable struggle” of this crew with the coronavirus epidemic.
“It’s very important to have the opportunity to thank them in their own personality,” said Gramer.
“I don’t want to be like McGregor and show my money.
I'm here to help people" - Chimaev after the story night at UFC Fight Island - RT Sport News
Khamzat Chimaev of Russia is now referred to as the next star UFC after signing up in the history of Fight Island, but he does not intend to flag his wealth on an insurmountable manner like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev wore the North Irish Rhys McKee Super Team in their battle in a well-known in Abu Dabí on Saturday night, he won his race when three minutes and 9 seconds were the team of the first batch by letting the bumps down on him in the floor.
The story recorded the name Chimaev in the history books UFC for the shortest time between the victory in the modern history of the race, where only 10 days were left from winning the British John Phillips with a similar result, then in between.
Chimaev, who has the winning ratio 8-0, received 50,000 US dollars for the performance of the evening against McKee and has captured the attention of the MMA world so fully that he is now referred to as "Khalib 2.0", which says that there is an inexplicable comparison due to the amount of similarities between Chima and UFCs in which he is born and at the moment of his death.
Despite the recent fame and financial benefit, Chimaev has said that he would not be reasonable to flag his wealth like the MMA Money Machine Conor McGregor or his peers in the boxing world, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
“I don’t just do this for me, I do it for anyone I can help.
“I don’t want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, show my money or something like that.
"I want to help people," Chimaev replied when asked about Fight Island how he would use the bonus.
He has, among other things, been following the follow-up team of Conor McGregor and working on Twitter-notandandans Dillon Danis, who wrote on the social media that he could "really" defeat Chimaev with a cashier.
It did not appear to have a toxic response from the battle squad that goes under the name “Borz,” or “wolf” in his native Czech language, who said he would “mala Danis with his eyes closed.”
Chimaev, who is now living in Stockholm, Sweden after moving to the country’s 19-year-old, leaves if he wants little to go for his financial power, but he is clearly unaware of his flaunting martial arts.
“I can paint anyone who is...

Israelis continue to protest the Prime Minister’s reaction to the world’s past
JERÚSALEM (AP) — Thousands of Israelis protested against the Prime Minister in the country on Saturday and were the largest protests outside the official headquarters of Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
The attack has lasted for a few weeks, but they began because of the criticisms that the government’s failure to respond to the coronavirus epidemic after having initially managed to keep the threat of the virus in shells.
Prosecutors on Netanyahu's hands due to corruption have continued to protest.
"Bibi, go home," said the protesters.
On the other hand, he said: “Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his clothes.”
Also, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the beach complex Netanyahu in the well-established town of Caesarea.
Last week, the police used a water pool to double groups in Jerusalem.
After what has been referred to as a fast-paced and illegal recovery of the economy in May, the number of new cases will be increased by 2000.
The economy of the country has been hit due to the limitations of the virus and the unemployment rate has increased by close to 20%.
Members say that the government’s financial assistance has hardly enough.
The bill took place in the shadow of a trial of corruption against Netanyahu, which began in the month.
The hearing will begin in January.
He is accused of fraud, intimidation, and bribery in a series of scandals.
Hundreds of protesters come together in downtown Los Angeles to show co-operation with protesters in Portland
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) — About 300 protesters came together in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon to support two-month old movements in Portland, Oregon, where attention is directed to the prosecutions of protesters.
In the United States, such as Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York, the United States had a large number of protests, including Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York.
The Los Angeles protests were organized by the Refuse Fascism and Youth Liberation Front groups.
The group went to the headquarters of the Los Angeles police station at First Street and Main Street, and then to the city centre.
The participants were also transferred to the Alameda Affair at the National Road 101, but later handed over to it.
The part of the people was seen breaking windows in public buildings in the middle of the city, and the confugation was written on the whole markings.
At least one person was arrested in the protests.
50 people in mosques at Eid festival and no prayer gatherings in Eidgah, says the government of Karnataka
The duration of Eid-ul-Azha, or Bakrid, will expire July 31 and August 1.
The government of Karnataka has issued that only 50 people come together in mosques for prayer because of Eid-ul-Azha, and have banned prayer meetings at Eidgah and other places due to the coronavirus epidemic.
Visitors who want to pray for mosques must be with a mask and keep distance, according to the AB Ibrahim, the Minister of Foreign Affairs for Minority Groups and Wakf.
The General Assembly has decided that the Eid-ul-Azha festival, also called or Bakrid, will be held on 31 July in Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Kodagu, but on 1 August elsewhere in the state.
It is stated that although prayer meetings are one of the most important festivals of Muslims on the Bakrid festival, such events will be banned in Eidgah and other places because of the COVID-19 epidemic.
Prayers must be allowed in mosques, so that no more than 50 people will participate at a time.
More than that, the prayer services were replaced, the Council said in the directive.
Don’t keep prayer meetings anywhere else, such as meeting rooms, social centers or “Shadi Mahal”, because it comes out.
The Karnataka government allows temples, mosques and other farmers to be opened to those who wish to be prayed from 8 June, so that it is well considered that the infection is due to COVID-19.
The U.S. Ambassador Wants to Get a Armored Life Warning
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, the U.S. ambassador to Iceland, believes his life is threatening abroad and wants to go with weapons.
At the beginning of 2020, the U.S. Embassy announced a “bodyguard” in Icelandic newspapers and actually used the English word bodyguard in the advertisement.
According to the authorities of Klavís, the main reason why these jobs were advertised is that Jeffrey Ross Gunter, the ambassador, believes his life was threatened in Iceland.
In Iceland and abroad, the ambassador has been convinced that he is at a high risk and the reason is that he is of Jewish origin.
What the threat is, is not as clear, but the speakers of Klass said that Islamic terrorists had been called as a threat.
CBS’s television network discussed the issue on its web this morning and has after the Washington authorities that Gunter is too mad, demanding that he carry his own weapons, to get a bullet-held vest and armed escort as well as firefighters.
According to CBS, Gunter has repeatedly said that there is no threat and that the advertisement after "bodyguard" is only to serve Gunter.
According to the Klúðsvík authorities, it was not inaugurated in June, but the application deadline ran out in February.
According to the Knús, there has not been a formal issue from the U.S. embassy because of these changes.
There has been no formal request for increased custody or after the authorisation of life-saving weapons outside the embassy wall.
The Icelandic law is not permitted except by a special authority from the State Police.
The speakers of the system say no information is available about any kind of threat.
The most recent threat to the police officer is a bit of a threat to terrorism.
There are no examples of terrorist attacks in Iceland and there is no evidence that terrorist or extremist groups work here.
For the purpose of enabling an armed life of the foreign embassy on the streets to pay and pay in Iceland, according to the authorities of Klavís, not present.
Gunter raised an interest in this country when he was awarded the first U.S. President and called the COVID-19 China virus.
Since then, he had the American and Icelandic flag.
A Seattle radio official who claims Trump’s reaction to protests now needs to get a gun after Starbucks coffeehouse under his apartment was destroyed — RT USA News
Paul Gallant has received a new look at violent protests after Trump’s assassination in June to say anarchists were burning and stealing Seattle City.
The only thing I needed to do was to get a new home.
"I feel like I need to buy a gun because this will clearly continue to happen," said Gallant on Twitter on Saturday night after he saw that the rifles had "discovered" the Starbucks cafe on the top of his hilly hillhouse.
"Now it's a lot of time. It looks like a street party down the street from me. Very angry now."
The use was so much as when Trump complained about it last month that Mayor Seattle was allowing violent protesters to take over the city.
"These liberal Democrats are free," the president said.
“The terrorists burn and rob our cities, and they feel it just wonderful, even death.”
Gallant, a co-directed member of the show “Danny & Gallant” at ESPN in Seattle, responded with a reply: “Get there in front of scientists last night and saw neither burn, rob or death.”
Gallant said last night that the police had recommended residents to stay away from his apartment building where explosives could be found in the damaged Starbucks cafe.
He published pictures of the shells and said: “Well done, half whites,” and noted that he had also seen fire several houses of spring.
“I don’t know what’s going on, but we’re going to get it.”
The interview did not lead people who claimed to Gallant for his previous opinion and received messages such as “Let’s just look at laxi,” and “Yes, maybe Trump was right.”
Jason Rantz, another radio broadcaster in Seattle, said, “We’re not going to leave at the end of this tour we talked about.”
Gallant went to the cave: “I ran and saw that the pouring of people was at the top of ‘slapp on laxi’ to me.
He said he was standing with his previous statement where he had walked through the CHAZ control area anarchist and although it was not as bad as it would have been.
“So there was fire and rage after all,” he said.
White Lines star Laura Haddock, aged 34, in an apartment search with his 28-year-old lover, Tom Rhys Harries
Laura Haddock and her boyfriend, Tom Rhys Harries, started together at the White Lines scene, which discusses the sigh and gossip of Ibiza, but in the housing search of the team this week their tastes were different and quiet, far away from the cattle life of the part of the island.
The couple, who played the symphony in the Netflix series popular, saw a look at an elegant weld county in Oxfordshire, which is for sale of 1.2 million pounds.
They met in the Range Rover area as Laura, 34, naked, dressed in gallbladder pants and white bolts, and hit there the real estate that led them to the inspection of the five-bedroom house.
In the White Lines, which was released last autumn, Laura played the role of Zoe Walker, who appeared assassinated alongside Ibiza when she investigates the murder of her brother, Alex, who was played by Tom, 28 years old.
They didn’t come up with their relationship until earlier this month, before the end of the year, from six years of marriage to Lauri and Sam Claflin, but he is known for the Hunger Games movies.
Together they have four-year-old son Pip and daughter Margot, who is two years old.
When they announced the divorce in August last year, Claflin, 34, wrote on Instagram: “I have decided to understand the legal conditions. We understand in love, friendship and with a deep respect for each other, and will continue to work on our upbringing.
Laura and Sam first met in 2011 in the audience test, and Sam, who also played in the Peaky Blenders, declared their wedding in 2013 as “most of my life’s achievements.”
Before Laura got her role in the White Lines, she played in the first Inbetweeneers film, and in the crime drama The Capture from the BBC, which was shown in the previous year, where she played the lawyer Design Roberts.
Tom starred in the second Inbetweeneers film and in the television series Brittania from Sky.
It’s too early to take care of another wave here in the country.
A specialist in the field of medical care says too early to complete the second wave of the epidemic.
Three new domestic cases were identified in the Landspital Department yesterday, and dozens of people have arrived.
Two domestic attacks were reported on Thursday, second in a man's thirty-six-year-old man, but met in a man's double-six-year-old man.
There was no infection since the beginning of the month.
Yesterday, three domestic victims were reported to have been killed, one of which had been on the Rey Cup football team in Laugardal.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, a police detective, told a news agency that the ferry had to take a visa because of its infection, but was initially considered.
Another infection occurs in a person who came to the country from abroad on 15 July.
Then the rules of the so-called domestic law had been taken.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, a specialist at the medical clinic, says that the person has gone after the old process.
The vision of him was negative with the arrival of the country, and he was then ill, having come into isolation, and having six been put into exile.
They are all on their way to display, but two of them are beginning to show signs.
The third infection is associated with the older man who was diagnosed on Thursday, and twelve have been reported to be associated with it.
It has been revealed that there is a new variant of the coronavirus that has not been mentioned before in this country.
“We don’t know exactly where these viruses come from, but we haven’t seen it before.
The one who has been charged with the virus to the land had been in Israel, but also in other European countries.”
She thinks too early to realize that the so-called second-generation epidemic has gone out of this country, like other countries in Europe fear.
“In the meantime, it’s still difficult to do so.
But we're on our way and we're watching, think about ways to respond if something like that could happen."
Megan Fox is talking about his relationship.
Megan Fox says he has found his twins in the rapper Machine Gun Kelly.
“When I met him and looked in his eyes, I knew.
“I’m interested in stars and I knew at the time that my twins were talking about it,” Fox said.
“Triboral steel is when the soul has come to a sufficiently high level of viability to allow it to divide into two different bodies at the same time,” Fox explained.
“We’re two half of the same soul, I think.
I told him as soon as we met.
I found it right away.”
“When we had known for two days, I asked him to meet me at lunchtime and I told him about the star mark and asked him to go out into his life.
I decided to go to the bathroom right away.”
Machine Gun Kelly takes the same string, but they were introduced to film.
“I started to hang outside her bike and I was hoping to see her.
She has the most beautiful eyes I’ve ever seen.”
Only two months ago Fox left her husband for ten years, Brian Austin Green.
They have three sons together.
Kanye apologizes to Kim.
U.S. musician, an American composer, and President Kanye West have asked Kim Kardashian West's wife for an apology to the appeals he made publicly about his family's private family.
"I'd like to apologize to my wife Kim for talking about private affairs," he wrote on Twitter last night.
Mirkir vandalism has been about the status of their relationship, but Kanye has gone a great deal on social media and at a number of meetings that he held last Monday, he talked about, among other things, his daughter North West and said he almost killed her.
Kim stepped forward on Wednesday and published a message to her followers on Instagram, where she kidnapped her husband’s ill-injured husband’s illness, but he was diagnosed with psychiatric disorder (e. bipolar disorder).
Kardashian West has not previously expressed itself publicly on the condition of the husband’s illness, and says it, among other things, to be because of their children’s marriages and to the right of Kanye to privacy when he came to his health.

Increased violence in protests against racial discrimination in the United States
The media has gone through the streets of the United States to raise awareness of racial rights.
The attack has been held for two months in Portland, Oregon, since May 25, when George Floyd killed police in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Trump administration has sent federal police officers to Portland, and even under protests.
The police are also talking about the existence of the FBI in the city.
In Seattle on Saturday, police used blasts and tear gas and arrested 45 people, after protesting the protests in Portland sparked violence.
Police said more than 20 police officers were injured.
One died on Saturday night in Austin, Texas when a gun was thrown into Black Lives Matter's demand.
The media said that the man could have walked up to the car armed rifle before he was shot.
“The problem is that it’s terrible that someone should let life in protests,” said Steve Adler, mayor of Austin.
Adler is said to be "harmi snoring and without words."
In Lousville, Kentucky, a group of armed protesters filed justice in the case of Breonnu Taylor, a black woman who died in Louisville when police entered her home, with the authority to enter without knocking, and shot her.
Taylor had first shot to the police officers, because he thought they were burglars.
One police officer has been fired because of Taylor's death, but the other police officers have not been charged.
The NFAC group, a group of black rebels who have participated in the protests, calls for more transparency in a police investigation into Taylor's murder.
According to police, three members of the NFAC were killed on Saturday when a shot accidentally detonated a weapon in the rebel army.
Possible group infection in a suspension
Five people have reported Covid-19 infection this week without border discrimination.
Two of them were infected with previously undisturbed viral variants and appear to have emerged three out of five infections completely uninhabited.
It is unknown whether individuals have been infected by the most distant person who has left the country or the characteristic Icelanders, who have probably infected more.
A medical professional says that possible group infection may be associated with one infection.
Two people were diagnosed with Covid-19 on the country’s last Thursday, with their own type of virus.
The origin of the infection is still unclear.
Three were diagnosed with the virus yesterday; one of them has been infected by other people who were diagnosed on Thursday, another came to the country on July 15th, and was probably infected outside, but the third is also infected with uninhabited origins.
Following an analysis of Icelandic genetic diagnosis, the two individuals diagnosed with the virus and associated with their new variant have not been identified before this country.
Kamilla Josephsdóttir, a specialist in the field of veterinary medicine and a local medical professional, said that Icelandic genetic analysis is now going over which type of virus has occurred.
“The incident was similar to the virus that has been happening in Switzerland, but not the same.
“They’re going to look at this and try to map it out better and lead bodies that from which part of the world the infection comes,” she says.
“It seems to be here on the Atlantic Ocean.”
The two of them were infected at the beginning of July and were taken to the United States.
Do you know that this new type of species is out there rather than jumping in the country?
“Yes, that’s different from what has been found here before that there’s really no chance that this was something to paint here,” Kamilla replied.
“All the chances are that these individuals have somehow come to a person who is new somewhere outside, without knowing it themselves.”
She says that there is still no evidence of where this new path could have come to the country.
“It could naturally be a traveler who has gone out of the country again, but there may also be someone who does not get symptoms and does not realize that he has been infected and could naturally get more infections later.
We’ll be in the next few days to watch it.”
“Someone who has come here is not something that is a smart group infection.
However, there are individuals who took part in the incident in connection with one of the infections yesterday, who have characteristics and have been taken to the show," Kamilla continued.
“We haven’t got results from them yet.
This could be a group infection.”
Do you think it’s a social issue now?
“It is not excluded.
It has not been over the past, but it is not excluded because we do not know who has carried this infection into this person, who was otherwise identified on Tuesday and on the other hand yesterday.”
Is it possible to talk about the fact that we are now starting a new wreckage of the virus?
“No, not yet them.
However, we naturally need to be very well awake and we need to keep in mind that there are so certain limits to what we can take a lot of samples from people.
We don’t take samples in the signs of people, but first we’re getting infections that seem to be inexplicably need us to be given a little more loose hands by taking samples from people with symptoms,” she says.
In this way, it is expected that the Landspitalet virus epidemics will be given in the show in the next few days to try to map the status of the domestic region better.
Does the hospital have the ability to increase domestic screening and to see the boundaries of the border?
“Not a bad thing, no.
Therefore, there must be some basis for taking samples in individuals who are not in the skirmishes; the person must be in accompaniment and show characteristics or then have symptoms and suspicions of getting into contact with someone who is new to the country or something like that," says Kamilla.
She says that infection is still ongoing in the infections that were detected yesterday, and that now a lot of work is being done to deliver information about the journeys of the individual.
She says that the insider appears to be inconvenient, but does not exclude the fact that some people who have already been installed in the application may have evidence that ultimately lead to the infection attack to the original infection.
The restaurant that gets to know but is one of the best.
There are not everyone who has a clear where the Bjargarste restaurant is located, and of course he has more fans abroad than in the country if the land can be applied to him on TripAdvisor and other sites.
He has heard of people who have fled to the country to visit him no wonder.
Berglind Hreiðarsdóttir, food blogger and food magazine author, raised on Bjargarstein on the pedestals and held water of enthusiasm.
“I don’t know where to start because the Bjargarste restaurant at Grundfjordur is clean out a wonderful place.
The story of the house is one of the most expensive things I know, the food up to ten, the show not of the worse end and great fun servants!" says Berglind.
“Gunn, owner of Bjargarstein’s gallant every animal’s right to the feet of others ahead of us.
The couple saw along with our girls the whole evening to talk so it must be told how good the food was," Berglind added.
“The place in which the restaurant is located is an old apartment that was moved in a healthy way at Grundfjordur.
The current owners of the red eyes of this house for sale in Akranes, found the beautiful sea level on Grundarfjörður and died the dream fulfilled.
You can read more about the history of the house on Bjargarstein’s website.”
“All things and all things about Bjargarstein are unique.
The collection has been combined from the whole family, and it truly puts its interest in the house.
On the upper floor is a seating area and really a cook and home to enter this wonderful restaurant.
The food and the food industry are then not secreting and knowing that much has been put into the magic of tasty and beautiful restaurants," says Berglind, and is the mark of the pictures.

Mick Fleetwood praises Peter Green: “His music will live”
Mick Fleetwood praised Peter Green, co-founder Fleetwood Mac, who died at the age of 73.
Green was the founder of this historical rock band, along with former Mick and Jeremy Spencer.
Although Green has left the band in 1970, before reaching her high-profile album at Rumours, Mick has praised this former band member and assures fans that his "music will continue to live".
“For me and all former and current members of Fleetwood Mac, it’s losing Peter Green a lot of memories,” Fleetwood said in a statement to PA.
"Peter was the man who founded the band Fleetwood Mac with me, John McVie and Jeremy Spencer.
No one has ever joined Fleetwood Mac without having a deep respect for Peter Green and his talents, and the fact that the music should shine and be moved by an unpleasant passion.”
"Peter, I will miss you, but be sure your music will live," added the 73-year-old rock star.
“I thank you for asking if I wanted to be your drummer for all these years.
We stood well and ran a public musical route that so many people have enjoyed.
“God be with you, dear friend...with love and respect, Mick Fleetwood.”
Andrey Greens was confirmed in the statement of the lawyer Swan Turton: “Fearly Peters Green announces with great sadness that Peter died this weekend, peacefully in sleep.
More information will be published in the next few days."
Green leaves a daughter, Rosebud Samuels-Greenbaum, with his ex-wife Jane Samuels.
Green founded Fleetwood Mac with Mick Fleetwood and Jeremy Spencer, but the band was originally called "Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac Featuring Jeremy Spencer".
The song came out of the band in 1970, after four albums.
Fleetwood Mac was looking to get a lot of praise and enjoy the popularity around the world after more improvements in the group, including Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks on Rumours and Tusk.
The Prince of Joakim
Jakim Danaprins, younger son of Margrétar Þórhildar Danadrottner and Hinrik's name Danaprins, is still in the hospital in Toulouse, France, where he was in surgery for the next day due to blood clots in the brain.
The Danish government, DR, has, after the spokesman of the Danish Shepherd, said that it is uncertain how long the prince, 51 years old, will be in the hospital, but his feeling remains stable.
According to the DR, research has now been conducted on the effects of the blood clot on the Prince’s health.
It has been reported after the doctor Peter Qvortrup Geisling, who discusses health issues for DR, that the consequences of blood clots in the brain often do not occur until 24 hours after surgery.
“It can be anything from negligible symptoms to helms, memory problems or difficulties with expression,” Geisling said.
He said that the prince could wait a few months of retiring.
Joakim Danaprins, named full name Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian and is also a disciple of Monpezat, a resident of the vineyard family, Château de Cayx in southern France when he fell ill on Friday night.
He was first transferred to a hospital in the town of Cahors, which is a dose from the garden, but then transferred to the University Hospital in Toulouse where he underwent surgery due to blood clots in the brain.
Google Pixel 4 can image the galaxy
Double opportunization allows the enhancement of Pixel 4 to be seen in three-dimensional and with a better pattern in background with a face display than in previous Pixel phones, which rely on the alpha of software to achieve this so-called "bookh" effects.
In order to demonstrate the quality of the camera, Google received the famous photographer Annie Leibovz in a field to discuss his experience of photography with Pixel 4 over the past 12 months.
Machine learning is still in the forefront of all the new smartphones from Google and in this phone is “computer-controlled photography” used to improve HDR+ position by combining up to nine different images.
New dual-functional controls offer different tracks for brightness and shadow and enable users to preview HDR+ in real-time.
The phone also angers itself on machine resistance to offer a better automatic whitening and improved “Night Sight” performance, which is so sensitive that it can capture the Milky Way in the night sky.
In addition to the other camera lens, Pixel 4 Soli presents the “responsibles” on the front of the phone that realizes Motion Sense movements so that users can release OK, turn off timetime, put alarm on the blast or turn off the sound of the phone by weighing the hand.
Any calculation of Motion Sense takes place in the device instead of connecting to the Internet, and the same applies to the re-establishment of Google helmets, where the technology crisis is now focusing on shortening the taste time and improving the privacy of users.
The continued emphasis on Google’s use of its machine learning capabilities to the fullest has also led to a new voice recording app that reviews audio in the bean without sending data on the internet.
The app is available only in English but more languages are expected.
Pixel 4 will also be the first phone to support Google Stadia, the game platform in the cloud that will be launched on November 19 in the United States, but will still report on the date for Australia.
In addition to a new Pixel mobile, Google also introduced the new Pixelbook Go Chromebook computer and other generation Google Pixel Buds headphones.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart headphones, which are expected to be next year, are completely wireless and create over the sounding sound that listens to the environment and constantly adjusts the sound to it to make the clarity the most.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smartphone headphones are completely wireless and adjust the volume level according to the noise around you.
Google also announced an update on its connecting Wi-Fi homestay in the Nest WiFi line with special legs along with many basics working in the context of improving wireless connection within the home.
The new Wi-Fi system, which will record the Nest, doubles its compatibility and adds built-in microphones and speakers to use the Google cable in each home base.
It goes for sale in Australia on November 5 and costs 399 discounts for the leg and one Wi-Fi point or $549 for two Wi-Fi points.
Google Home Mini has also been updated, but new 79 dala Nest Mini improves sound quality by double bass accuracy and has acquired built-in wall fastener.
All Google chat speakers will receive a new call system manager for communication between devices in the home as well as the ability to call the Nest Mini without the home with the Google Home app.

"Woman's throw beer bottle in sell" in Devon
The gunman threw beer bottles in a sell when he interfered with the fishing line, according to a good review.
The images taken at Hope's Nose near Torquay appear to show a man on a dress that throws something into a beast.
Duncan Kenny, who took the pictures, said the grey sea has been fishing when the frivolator drained from a bottle and threw it into the back of the animal.
Kenny called it a “real and trusting behavior.”
He said he had been picking up trash in this beautiful place in Devon last Sunday morning along with other people in the Seal Project when he witnessed the attack.
“The guy tried to get to the fishing line,” he said.
“The gunman stretched the beer, drained the bottle, and threw it into the saddle.
“The man got his back and he looked at the crime.”
The teacher said that “the better the journey would be selling strong-built animals” than that the seller had simply been doing what was natural to him.
"Because throwing glass bottles into him, you stop him on his way," he said.
The Seal Project team said it was “not a unique case” and that it had received “a lot of notifications about this aggressive behavior.”
In Facebook’s Facebook post, the company says that its volunteers have collected 12 pieces of trash in the collection of Hope’s Nose on Sunday and that “a number of examples of social behavior” had been seen.
Everyone sells the protection under the laws of protection and people are asked to stay away from them.
Rising from Kristnapolli in Laxá
The first hundred-year-old was caught in Laxá in the second party today.
The work was done by Arnóttir Guðmundsson.
He had been in a cave in Kristnapolli this morning and was 89 centimetres.
After lunch, he was again at Kristnapolli, thinking about a story that he had heard that the slow device would have been fishing.
With this in mind, he went with Collie Dog king and threw over Kristnapoll.
Soon he got a shot as he says himself.
“After five seconds, he cleaned himself completely, and I realized that this was my goal.
I was stressed because I had a single pound of money.
I’m going to go to fish, but I’ve been with it for about 40 minutes.
He was really comfortable.
A few trips up and down the pole, but then I got to beach him and it was a great feeling.
I ran away from him and jumped on him.
He measured 102 meters and I doubled it," said a hedge hunter at the Tverðargil Zoo in Laxá, in a conversation with the Spork performances.
It’s like no one starts when they come to a hundredths.
It was his eighth.
He had such fish in the plant, Svartá, Hraunsfjörður, Kjarár, two in Langdalsá and one in Eystri Rangá.
The hunt is in Laxá, in the valleys, according to Arnórs.
The team that finishes at noon tomorrow has 35 laxas and our man has eighteen of them.
We expect a lot of trouble because of design.
Hanna, the first filibly Atlantic Ocean this year, landed in Texas in the United States last night.
Hanna quickly lost power and had to get worse, but despite the fact that there has been a lot of rain in the area and is expected to be massively complex.
It is expected that up to 30 centimetres of rain in one day, but in special places it could reach up to 46 centimetres, according to the AP news agency.
In particular, we are faced with a dangerous crash that could take place because of the rain.
The area where Hanna reached the country has been under attack to download due to the great distribution of the new coronavirus there.
In addition, the sea has gone on land and has caused damage.
At least 43,700 people without electricity have now been opened and a number of high-speed stations have been opened in the area.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, said it was important for people to listen to experts and follow instructions.
Below you can see a picture that the AP reporter caught this morning.
House burned, shops robbers and burglary damage
More than sixty people have been killed and sixty more injured after the attack in the village of Masteri in Darfur, Sudan yesterday.
The attack “was the latest in a series of serious safety incidents last week, where houses were burned, shops and markets robbed and domestic damage,” says a statement from the United Nations Human Rights Agency in the capital Kartúm, which was sent out today.
Abdalla Hamdok, Prime Minister of Sudan, has issued that security forces be sent to the war-free province to “the world of inhabitants and crops.”
Only two days ago, the unknown army in the area killed at least 20 people, including children, in another attack.
“The threat of violence in different parts of Darfur is to lead to an increase in global growth, it establishes the agricultural sector in danger and threatens the lives and livelihoods of people,” the United Nations said.
The conflict in Darfur, in the western part of Sudan, began in 2003 when rebels, who are Arabs, fought against the government of Kartúm.
Iraqi government and Arab troops, who tried to break the rebellion down, have been accused of widespread atrocities, but some 300,000 were killed in the attack according to the United Nations.
Oma's al-Bashir, who was cast by a chair as leader of Sudan, is the successor of the International Criminal Court for the purpose of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity in Darfur.
Meanwhile, the new government in Sudan is now trying to negotiate peace with the main rebel groups.
TV newswoman thanks the audience for taking after cancer spray
TAMPA, Florida (AP) - TV newswoman in Florida thanks the audience for having noticed a knot on her neck and sent her an email to check it out.
Victoria Price, a newswoman at WFLA in Tampa, went to this advice and diagnosed with cancer.
Price said on Twitter that she would go to surgery on Monday to remove the tumor, thyroid and several poisons.
“The doctor said it was spreading, but not too much, and we are hopeful that this will be my first and last action,” she said.
The viewer sent Price emails last month and said the knot reminded her of the knot she had had had.
Price, a 28-year-old research journalist, said this week that her television station’s slogan was “8 in a team with you.”
“But the role recently changed when the viewer was in a team with MÉR and I couldn’t be more grateful,” Price said.
“I have to forever thank the woman who made me send an e-mail, a completely ignorant woman.
She had no obligation to do so, but she did.
Talking about being with a man in a team.”
The district of Jeronimo Open Space temporarily closed after two attacks of sulfur — CBS Los Angeles
Two were bits of smooth wolves near the Oso Creek train line at Jeronimo Road in Mission Viejo on Saturday morning and the end needed the route temporarily.
Laura Wittmer says she sees a sleek wolf almost every morning and usually tries to avoid them just, but on Saturday morning one came straight to her and ran her in the foot.
The road has been closed while the attacks are being investigated.
Mission Viejo-borg published it as saying: “Today, two different parties announced that the slick wolf had bitten a person. The Mission Viejo mission is to work in the case of the division of fish and animal life, and part of the Jeronimo Open Space has been closed. The exhibition is to be considered and will be on when you are on a great trip there.”
Wittmer tried to beat the sulfur with a water bottle.
She called the emergency line to get her car, but could even drive on a emergency call.
The pregnant wolf disappeared in the trucks, but public workers are hoping to run it and test it for dog breeds.
Wittmer is treated with dogs as a precaution for the next two weeks.
She said that this awesome incident would not keep her from the morning race, but from now on she would choose another place.
The nature of the person who was bitten is not clear.
U.S. Nationalist racial hatreds deal with police in Seattle
The attacks in Seattle on Sunday between police and protesters against racial hatred ended by the arrest of a number of people, but uncompanies among the general public due to the plans of Donald Trump’s U.S. President to send a large number of public police officers into major cities.
A protest against racial hatred and police violence has been reported following the death of George Floyd, an unmistakable young man in Minneapolis in May.
