People are worried about “thinking like a refugee.”
Uggur is in some councillors because of the proposal to change their titles in the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, members of the Senate).
The question is, for a plan to change the name of the council in the election.
People from all over the world are worried that it could make them laugh.
One employee from the team said his party was worried that “it is about Twp and Pwp.”
For readers who live outside Wales: in English, twp is false and pwp means saur.
A committee member of the Plaid Cymru group said that the whole party was “unsatisfied” and had made other suggestions for the name.
The chairman of the council said that his party had “open mind” about the change of name, but pointed out that there was no big difference between the word MWP and Muppet (flón).
In this context, it can be noted that the well-crafted w is drilled similar to that of Icelandic.
The council, currently working on a legislative radio to present the name changes, said: “The decision of all the names of the members of the council will of course be taken by the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the council the power to change its name.
In June, the Council published the findings of the polls among the general public, which showed great support for calling the Council well.
With regard to ten councillors, the WMP (Welsh Parliament Members, electors of Parliament) elected MWP to the most support of the public in the polls.
According to the news, councillors are now proposing other proposals, but it may be difficult to reach an agreement for the Chairman of the Council, Elin Jones, who will present a preliminary report on the changes within a few weeks.
The debate on the regulations will also include other changes to how the Council works, including rules on the conduct of the Board of Directors and the organisation of the Committee.
Members will be able to pay the final vote on their title when the debate begins.
Macedonians are voting for a name change in the country.
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change the name of their country in the "Long North Macedonia."
This issue was signed in an attempt to solve a decade-long dispute with the neighboring country of Greece, which has its own territory with the name of Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that their neighbour’s name in the Norwegian equivalent requirement in its territory and has greatly protested their applications for membership of the EU and Nató.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, disagrees with the vote on the name change, has said he will not look at the elections that apply.
However, the members of the votes, including Zoran Zaev Prime Minister, have said that the name change is simply the price that needs to be paid to join the EU and Nató.
St. Martin's Church is a church in Harlem having difficulty
“The people I’ve spoken to said before could find a bar and church on every street,” said Mr. Adams.
"Today, it's not easy to find there."
He said it would be understandable that he would be able to get a foothold.
“People have other ways to meet,” he said.
“Children are no longer the center of the neighborhood where people come together regularly.”
As for the churches, he worries that the money that is transferred from the sale of property will not only last as long as the leaders are expected to, or sooner or later, they will be back at the beginning.
He added that it would be possible for a church to be replaced for residential buildings full of people who will not help to save the remaining streets of the vicinity.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and will, therefore, flee for this church to be closed for full and all, because it is unlikely that most people who move in these apartments will be members of this church.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the centre of black - the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and St. Martin's church decades later.
The beginning of the white mercenary movement was carried out in the 1960s.
A group of young people who had worked in the vicinity took over the building.
St. Martin’s Church under the guidance of John Howard Johnson, who had the initiative to address the shopping malls of 125th Street, the main shopping street Harlem, who wanted to employ the older employees or to provide them with the status risks.
The building was severely damaged in 1939, but members of the congregation special Johnsons made plans to rebuild it and also destroyed the clock.
Special David Johnson, son and successor Johnson called the clock proudly “the poor of the people.”
The expert who played the clock game in July called it a different name: “Education Fund” and “a unique historical instrument.”
The specialist, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first clock game in the world as a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, played on, but he moved on to a larger clock game in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had no one else in his place.
In the last few months, many architects and architects have laid their way to St. Martin, some of the councillors of the church and others of the bishops.
The Church Council - which oversees the application and is commissioned by the church leaders - wrote the bishopship in July and described its concern over the fact that the bishop's office "is looking to get the cost over" the church, even if it had not been involved in the advice of the architects and the works of the bishop's office.
Some members of the bishops complained of lack of resistance to the half of the bishop's territory.
Sharks have a 13-year-old boy who caught a shark in California.
According to the government, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him on Saturday when the boy was drinking after a hiatus in California during the first day of the summer.
The attack took place at seven o’clock in the morning near Beacon’s beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been drinking along with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and re-read the group of others to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that he had kept in the first place that this was only tense to have reached the hip, but then he said, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
"The whole thing about him was torn up," Hammel said about what he saw when he came to the boy.
“I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: ‘It’s a shark in the water!’ he added.
The boy was transferred with a helicopter to the Rady barnas Hospital in San Diego where he is seriously injured.
It is not known what kind of shark is attacking the boy.
Captain Larry Giles said in a media meeting that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks before, but he was not of a dangerous type of shark.
Giles added that the victim had suffered severe damage to the upper body.
The site closed beach access from Ponto Beach Beach Beach in Casablad to Swami’s beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, in research and safety.
Giles said that over 135 different species of shark were in the area, but most of them do not feel dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plan to take care of the UK’s cosmetic market
Sainsbury’s plan to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetics in the shopping mall and with specially trained helpers.
This is part of a plan to go into the cosmetic market of the UK, which is 2.8 billion pounds worth worth and is constantly growing during sales of fashion and home products goes down. The biggest cosmetic products will be tested in 11 stores all over the country and will be set up in more stores next year if successful.
Investments in cosmetics are part of the way large-scale to use a shelf that was previously used by telescopes, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury’s victory is to double its cosmetic selection for up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L’Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt’s Bees will also gain increased space with marked areas similar to those found in the shops like Boots.
The payment will also begin again sales on the Boutique-new product selection so that the majority of the goods are vegan-friendly, but younger consumers demand it in greater measure.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will test the defense in two verses Sainsbury’s, the first opened in Croydon in south London last week and the next will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Net commerce and increased availability of consumers to buy a small amount of food daily in the neighborhoods means that big markets need to add more to get people to come to theirs.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said that the shops would resemble shopping centers in more measure is the shopping mall trying to fight the low-cost Aldi and Lidl with more services and other products than food.
Sainsbury’s has seen Argos shops in hundreds of shops and has also introduced to the history of the number of Habitat stores since both chains were purchased two years ago.
The first attempt of the store to live up to its cosmetic and pharmaceutical facilities was not successful.
Sainsbury’s research partnered with Boots around 2000 but it ended due to the analysis of how to share the sales of pharmaceuticals in large-scale markets.
The new trend comes after Sainsbury’s sales of its pharmaceutical products, which were 281 numbers, to Celesio, the owner of Lloyd’s drug stores, in 125 million pounds three years ago.
According to the policy, Lloyds will have a role in these plans by adding a large range of luxury coating brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Marketing Director Sainsbury’s, said: “We have made the appearance of our cosmetic products to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in special training for employees who will be trained in the field of advice.
Our product collection is designed to meet all the needs. The health environment and convenient location make us an exciting cosmetic store that transforms old shopping habits.”
Peter Jones "the owner" after Holly Willoughby quits with $11 million deal
Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons Den, became the "returner" after the television star Holly Willoughby quits a $11 million deal with his company to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their home brand, Truly.
The company was similar to Goop, brand Gwyneth Paltrow.
Willoughby, aged 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby deserves Peter Jones, the star from Dragons’ The, after suffering pain, by stopping participating in popular lifestyle companies in the late hours to focus on new and profitable agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to Jones, Jones has been a “pregnant” meeting on Tuesday at its headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, when the TV show popularly recognized it did not have sufficient time for home product and follow-up brand Truly because of the new contracts worth up to £1.5 million.
The company has been similar to Goop, brand Gwyneth Paltrow, and was designed to double the assets of Willoughby, but their estimated value is 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was going to withdraw from Truly embarrassed Jones from the UK to live on one of many summer homes.
He said: “Truly was a long-time leader of Holly.
It would be her future work that would bring her back in the next two decades.
Her decision to quit was completely opened.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so short that the line went on the market.
It’s a full stock of products in Marlow headquarters that are ready to go for sale.”
Experts believe that the elimination of this Morning present, which is among the most popular stars in the UK, can cost the company millions because of the great product investment, ranging from pillows and stickers to clothing and home products, and possibly cause further damage to the product line.
This could also mean a long friendship.
Willoughby, three children's mother, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends Jones and Töru Capp, his wife, for decades.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined the board of directors in March.
The company spends its summer vacation together and Jones has a 40 percent share in the company Baldwin, which produces television material.
Willoughby will be the official representative of the M&S brand and will be in place of Ant McPartlin as the ITV series I'm a Celebrity.
Jones said last night, “We don’t want to say anything about his business.”
It’s hard to talk, and then we became lovers.”
He worked with the criticism he received from the media, for saying something many would consider inappropriate for the president, and for being so positive in the garden leader of North Korea.
Why did Trump have so much left?
Trump said he was fighting for the voice of a reporter.
“I haven’t given anything left.”
He noted that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called his first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards North Korea nuclear weapons.
However, we are talking about putting down nuclear weapons.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the main ambassador to North Korea, said on Saturday that North Korea had not been forced to have a "right answer" from the United States at the first steps of North Korea to nuclear weapons.
He said that instead, the United States continued to maintain business designs for the purpose of maintaining pressure.
Trump was all positive in his discussion.
“We have a big deal with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people had lost their lives.
Now our relationship is great.”
He said his attempts to improve Kim's relationship with Kim have returned positive results - fire tests had stopped, hostages had been let loose and earthly tenants of U.S. soldiers were returned home.
He also had an unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to enter the squad, only 200 people were standing there,” Trump said.
Floods and earthquakes in Indonesia caused a great damage to the island, hundreds have gone
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, the international human rights organizations were told that they were not needed.
Despite the fact that over 10 percent of the population of Lombok had to flee their home, emergency conditions were not mentioned, but it is the premise that international organizations can have assistance there.
“In many cases, they have reportedly stated that they are not going to ask for assistance from international organizations, so that this is difficult,” said Mr. Sumbung.
While the Save the Children’s Association is building a team to travel to Palu, it is still not certain when foreign aid workers can have jobs in the area.
Mr Sutototo, a spokesman for the country’s health care agency, said that Indonesian officials were considering the situation in Palu to see whether to allow international organisations to assist with the aid work.
As to how common earthquakes are in Indonesia, the country is badly prepared to protect nature.
Flood waves have been erected in Aceh, but they are rare in sight with other coastlines.
So it seems that flood wave waves in Palu have increased even though the warning has been issued.
Even in the best circumstances, it can be a challenge to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make planning even more complex.
A nurse who has been riding at the port of Lombok in order to speed up the victims of the earthquake is now on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to get to the new accident site.
Joko Widodo, President of the United States, made the main election of his campaign to restore the downhill transportation of Indonesia and has put a lot of money into roads and railways.
However, a short amount of money has been paid for by Mr Joko, but elections will be held next year.
Mr Joko also needs to struggle with persistent tension between the religious groups in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have dedicated themselves to the unity of religious practice.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes are the exchange of Christians and Muslims on the streets with beds, bows and eagles and other original weapons.

Voiced by the British Senate by Cromwell, the most recent note is the fact that “recognizing the story”
The line of the statue would be a sacred justice for the Tibetan destruction of his great pupitarian escorts on so many cultural and religious dingles of England.
The Cromwell company, however, said that adding Mr. Crick was “the bloating” and “the attempt to re-establish the story.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the discussion of removing the statues, it was impossible to shorten Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace.
And the English Civil War against cultural symbols was neither a decree nor the execution of Cromwells.
In the meantime, the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of Thomas his ancestors in the century before.
The final statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a mark of the 19th century era and is part of the history of a man who many believe to not deserve praise.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is spoken by many, perhaps rather late in the 19th century, but today, the protection of the parliament has been counter-restricted in his case of the Kingdom.
There is still a lot of historical evidence that this description is correct.
However, it is believed that the conflict that was in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the development of our nation and that Cromwell is a well-known individual who is a representative of one side of their efforts.
It is worth celebrating and remembering his achievements as the protector of the state.”
A pig is killed on the Chinese side and kills him.
Pigs attacked the Chinese people and killed him on the market in the southwest of China, according to news from the site.
The man, who is only named by his surname “Yuan,” was found dead with broken beats and the roof of blood near the high market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, according to news from the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
Sveinbodan is responsible for injecting a vaccine into pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He had travelled with his uncle from the neighboring neighborhood of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his uncle found him dead and saw that animals in the nearby pigs were opened.
He said that the inside of the wound would have been a big lump of blood with his mouth.
The trial confirmed that 250 kg of the computer had killed the person, according to the report.
“My cousin was bloody and wounded,” said the uncle, with the surname “Wu,” with Guiyang Evening News.
The recording of a security camera showed Yuan coming to the market at 4:40 a.m. in the morning to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The man who killed the man was not in the possession of Yuan or his uncle.
The owner of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked inside so that it did not attack anyone else while the police collected evidence on the scene.
According to news, the family of Yuan and the owners of the market in terms of the benefits of his death.
There are examples that pigs have attacked people, although they are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their place in Massachusetts and seriously injured the man.
Ten years ago, 300 kg of pigs hugged a pig with a tractor until his wife fell on the animal.
After the death of Oregon, one of his pigs in 2012, another victim from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that blood taste can wake up attacks on them.
“They’re just playing.
They want to be happy and they are curious, they don’t want to hurt anyone.
“You just have to show them respect,” he said.
The remnants of the filibly Russo carry great results over the southwest part of the United States
As predicted, the concentration of the filiblis of Rósou is decreasing, he passes over the cooler hips of the north coast of Mexico.
On the other hand, Rósa will carry great results that could lead to floods in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rósa became a filiblyl in category 1, with a wind force of up to 136 km per hour, at 5 o'clock in the morning to the east coast time on Sunday, and it was located about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is planned to go north on Sunday.
At the same time, it is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, and it will go east to the west coast of the United States. When Rósa arrives at Baja California Gulf on Monday as a hotspot storm, it will follow a great heat threat in the northwestern part of the United States.
Rose will follow up to 25 cm of the outcome in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the hot tub will be mixed with the nests approaching and forming a huge and widespread result over the southwest part of the next few days.
Close to 2.5 to 10 cm of waste can cause dangerous rapid lifts, moving on soils and possible flooding in the desert.
A huge heat heater rocket will cause up to 5 to 10 cm of the output in an hour in some places, especially in the southern part of Nevada and Arizona.
It is located up to 5 to 10 cm off the descent of some places in the southwest part, especially in the most important Arizona state.
The possibilities are in rapid weather conditions, due to the spread of heat.
People are encouraged to walk out into the desert when the danger is at a temperature change.
Heavy rains can change the waves in an impermeable fast and thunderstorms have brought with them whales and duststorms.
The hospital approaching will carry a local extinction site in certain areas of the South California coastline.
There is a capacity of about 1 cm of the output that could cause a slight movement on the soil and the noise on the roads.
This is the first of the rainy season.
A number of scattered hot summers will begin to approach Arizona in late Sunday and early Monday, before spreading across larger areas in late Monday and Tuesday.
A great deal will spread across four states on Tuesday and ended on Wednesday.
We expect a lot of temperature changes in October everywhere in the United States, depending on what the North Sea region is going to go to high school, but the temperature is still somewhat high.
Sometimes this can cause high temperature fluctuations over short distances.
See a good example of a lot of heat in the US on Sunday.
There is almost 7 degree heat between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
The next few days will continue summers trying to build up and spread back.
It is expected that a large part of the Middle and Eastern United States will get a warm start to October with temperatures around 25 degrees or more from the plains of the south to the north.
The temperature could rise to 25 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term forecast suggests that there is a high probability of rising temperatures above the average for the US in the previous month of October.
More than 20 million people followed over Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million people watched an exciting testimony Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court judge, on Tuesday and the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual offences that had occurred in the 9th century.
At the same time, politicist patrols continued and television stations took a break on a regular schedule to publish the latest news on Friday: Jeff Flake, a senior senator from Arizona, proposed an initial call for the FBI to investigate the allegations for a week.
Ford told the House of Representatives that she was confident Kavanaugh would have taken care of her drunk and tried to cut her off in school.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he was sure it would not have happened.
More people have looked at the trial, but the 20.4 million that Nielsen has said had been watching on Friday.
The company ranked among CBS's television channels, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Computers were not available immediately for other television shows showing the hearings, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen is usually in trouble with measuring people’s views in offices.
To put this together, this audience is similar to the size and for the level of football or the Oscars celebration.
According to Nielsen, most of the hearings that took place throughout the day, at Fox News Channel or 5.69 million. Their rating channels have a short introduction to Kavanaugh.
ABC was second-placed with 3,26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million NBC, with $94 million, MSNBC had 2.389 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
It was a great experience after the trial.
Flake was the center of the festival on Friday.
After writing this House of Representatives, the Republican Party issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh in favour of taking the CNN and CBS pictures of it when protesters made an appeal to him on Friday morning, he tried to go into a drug to find a meeting at the Court of Justice.
He went down for a few minutes while shamelessly raining over him at CNN.
A woman said, “I’m standing right in front of you.”
“Do you think he’s telling the people the truth?”
The people said to him, “You have chosen while so many women stand unelected.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the drug was finally found, he said he would express himself rather at the meeting of the committee.
The cable and television stations were all with direct broadcasts later when the judge’s committee asked whether to send Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Senate.
Flake said that he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the other candidates in the next week, but the majority of the Democrats have asked for it.
Flake was convinced in part by interviews with his friend, Chris Coons, the Senator of the Democratic Party.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and some other senators after that.
Votes Flake changed because it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the study.
President Trump has filed for an investigation into Kavanaugh's investigation.
May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, accuses critics of “warring in politics” because of Brexit

Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, is a conference held in Birmingham, United Kingdom, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, published next to her interview on the paper, Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, announced that the so-called Chequers plan on Brexit and said that the United Kingdom and the European Union should run two separate customs, which would otherwise be “unrealized.”

The government wanted to thank a special police officer in Louisiana, a criminal investigation laboratory police officer, the Southern University University police, and the cities of the area for the assistance of the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, the chairman of the LSU, thanked law enforcement officers for “the cost and the search for justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The high-growth two-metre forward jersey was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He scored 5.6 points on average and scored 2.6 points for each game in the last season.
Will Wade, a basketball coach LSU, said on Friday that the team was “harm tow” and “in case” because of the death penalty.
“It’s something you’re worried about at the time,” Wade said.
Mount Elfjall spanish over Mexico City
Assault from the Mount Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost capital of Mexico.
The Center for Disaster Prevention (National Center for Disaster Prevention) advised Mexico residents on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after its activity increased in the jungle and recorded 183 cases of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center was accompanied by a vibration and a shield from the volcano.
Photos on social media showed a thin layer of island in a car park in each of Mexico’s counties, such as Xochimilco.
Earth scientists have noticed an increased activity in the Milky Way, which is 72 miles southeast of the capital, since an earthquake of 7.1 on the Richter river across Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police in charge of the Catalan court's right to the anniversary of the independence of the party
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent protests took place at an unaccompanied police and thousands participated in protests for the first birthday of the presidential election in Catalonia to describe independence.
A group of monsters dressed in the separatist masked anesthetics with eggs and threw scents that shaped dark dust on the streets, which were usually otherwise full of tourists.
The conflict also erupted later that day and the police used cooling systems to keep the floods in the wetlands.
He said: “We don’t forget and forgive” for a few hours while their opponents resisted: “Let live Spain.”
Four people had to complain about minor injuries that they suffered in the protests, according to the media at the scene.
A large number of tensions continue in the independent region one year after the national referendum on 1 October was ruled illegal by the authorities in Madrid, but was celebrated by the Catalan authorities.
The majority of the voters were independent, but the participants were poor, as most of them were opposed to the election.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were killed last year when police tried to stop the elections in elections across the region, but it had a conflict with them.
The Independents had stayed outside overnight on Friday to prevent protests against the police of the country.
The message went out but was forced to go another way.
Narciss Termes, 68, participated in protests of the separation of his wife and said he was no longer expecting Catalonia to gain independence.
“In the past, we experienced some of our best moments.
“I saw my parents cry for joy because they can sing, but now we sit down,” he said.
Despite having reached the necessary end of the year, although na na na na na na naar sir in regional elections in December last year, independent Catalans have had difficulty keeping steam for years, since many of the known leaders are either independent or in detention after the trial due to their role in the planning of the Assembly and independent statements.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old machine worker who took the protests to the police's support on his phone, said that the politicians of both states had questioned the investigation.
“The tension is growing increasingly,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison and asked for justice from late last year, announced that he would offer himself to the European Parliament next year.
“My campaign in the European elections is the best way to condemn the return of democracy and the oppression we have seen in the Spanish government,” he said.

Menga scores in 1-0 win Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga
Ling Livingston, who came from the lower division, came the Rangers in open documents and Steven Gerrard had to endure his second loss in 18 games as director of the Ibrox team.
Mark Dolly Menga made the gypsy and team Gary Holt's is now in second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard has not yet worked in the field at this game and the game against Hearts, which are eight points ahead in the top spot, the next Sunday.
For this game, the Rangers will take the Rapid Vienna in the European Union on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston is still undefeated in the division with six wins, and Holt’s main coach has not yet had to experience a loss since he came to Kenny Miller in the last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against bitless guests
The route Holts should have been over a long time before it scored the mark, but their bone thickness caused Ranger's great trouble.
Scott Robinson was able to break through, but he tried to score, and Alan Lithgow then cut through the guard to counter the shell transmission from Graig Halkett on the ground.
Visitors killed Rangers playing in front of them in quietness, knowing they could cause gestures of trouble in the right places.
And that’s how the target was scored.
Rangers gained the extrapyrene and Livingston won in creating a market opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga in unity, which took the shipment and scored from the middle of the hostite.
At that stage, the Rangers had advised over the ball, but the defenses of the home workers were unstoppable and Liam Kelly, the market guard did not have to put much effort on it.
So it continued in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos had been able to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by the feet of Allan McGregor, the fieldman of Rangers, and Lithgow shot off the field after the application from Livingston.
Spyrn ran continuously in the court of Livingston, but was fired, and two demands for the vitaspyron - following the defense of the Halkett against Glenn Middleton, and one after hand - were dismissed.
"Great" by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland reporter at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Great performance and performance for Livingston.
For a normal man, they remained excellent and continued to move out of all their expectations.
Their playing style and team members have hardly changed anything since they came back in the top division, but Holt deserves a lot of compliments for having their pupated team together from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, the team was very good and led the full-ship defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worall all the time.
The Rangers lack inspiration.
As good as they have been under the control of Gerards, they played far below expectations.
They went badly to complete their applications and only once managed to open the valorhelming of the homers so this should be a wake for the Rangers who are currently sitting in the middle of the division.
Erdogan will be sent back to Cologne.
It was a smile and bright sky on Saturday (29 September), when leaders of Turkey and Germany met over breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the discussion of Erdogan’s visit to Germany, which has the purpose to improve relations between the two countries of the Nataro.
There has been a dispute between them because of these issues, such as human rights, media freedom and entry into Turkey in the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, giant mosque.
The city is home to most Turkish inhabitants without Turkey itself.
The police tried to prevent 25,000 people from gathering together in front of Moscow, but the number of supporters could be found in her vicinity to see her president.
Hundreds of protests against Erdogan - many of them Kurdar - also heard and denounced both Erdogan's policy and the decision of German government to offer him to the country.
The audiences two reflect how much this host is, but he is hailed as the hero of some Turks in Germany and hated as the protector of others.

The coral reef threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with fast-paced (surcharged areas could benefit from)
It’s rare that the heat heater is hit over Arizona, but it’s likely that it will be early next week when the remnants of the filibly Rósu are carried over the southwest part, with a risk of sudden failure.
The country’s weather facilities have already released warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and western Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rósa will go straight across Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive late on Monday with a departure.
The Phoenix weather agency said on Twitter that only "one-two trap firearms had reached the strength to be classified as heatlift storms or lowers in less than 320 km away from Phoenix from the 1950s!
Katrina (1967) was a filibly within 64 km of the border of Arizona.
The last predictions from the country's felibal center forecast 5-10 cm from the exit, with the capture of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
It is likely that 2.5 to 5 cm in other areas of the southwest part, including the central parts of the Kletttólla and the large (The Great Basin), with the possibility of unique outcomes up to 10 cm.
For those who are not at risk of landing in the hurrys, the arrival of Rosu could be a blessing because the great droughts are in the area.
While the flood can cause a lot of damage, some of this outcome will have a positive effect, since the drought is now in the southwest part.
According to the U.S. drought control, at least a great drought is over 40 percent of Arizona, but it is the second-highest party," according to the weather.com news.
The first will the California State of California catch up on the Gulf of Baja California in Mexico.

The storm passes over a cooler sea in the Pacific Ocean, and his power is decreasing.
He is expected to live in Mexico as a hotstorm on Monday or Monday night.
There is a high impact on some areas in Mexico, with a significant risk of flooding.
“Búist is expected to drop up to 7.5 to 15 cm in Baja California and into the northwestern part of Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 cm from the exit,” he said in a statement from the weather.com.
Rósa will then hold north over Mexico, as a hotspot storm, and then reach the borders of Arizona early on Tuesday morning as the hot tub. She will then continue through Arizona and come to the south of Utah in late Tuesday evening.
“The greatest risk expected to be from Russia or its lease is a great loss in Baja California, north-west Sonora, and in the southwest part of the U.S. desert area,” said the State Department.
It is believed that this death resulted in life-threatening thunderstorms and the movement of the soil in the deserts, and in the mountains.

Trump says Kavanaugh has "getting to find evil and anger" from the Democratic Party
“The vote for the support of Kavanaugh judges is a vote that rejects the mercyless and disgraceful methods of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in a meeting with supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "failure to find evil and anger" from the Democratic Party out all his nominations.
Kavanaugh carried testimony to the Senate on Thursday, where he tried the attempts from Christine Blasey Ford that he had been sexually assaulted a few decades ago when they were both incarcerated.
Ford also witnessed the committee's allegations.
The president said on Saturday that “The British would have seen genius and humanity and courage” Kavanaughs during the day.
“The vote for confirmation at Kavanaugh judges is a vote confirming one of our snowiest lawyers, a lawyer with an elegant career record as a public worker,” he told a group of his supporters in Western Virginia.
The president pointed out in favor of Kavanaughs when he talked about the importance of supporting Republicans involved in the mid-season talks.
“There are five weeks in one of the most important elections in our lives.
“I don’t make it up, but I do it really,” he said.

Trump claimed that Democrats were working to “keep and prevent.”
The first key decision on the school of the elderly’s nomination for Kavanaughs is to proceed no later than on Friday, according to the aid of the leader of the Republicans in the interview with CNN.
Hundreds of people died after earthquakes and floods in Indonesia, and probably the number of dead will rise
At least 384 people died and many schooled off is a huge century of skulls on the beaches, when a great earthquake and flood surge ride the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered together at the festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six meters of high waves of land on the shore of the sun, schooled a number of people on the sea and destroyed everything for them.
The storm was formed after an earthquake that was 7.5 points on Richter.
“When the flood wave was photographed yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn’t rush right away, so it allowed life,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s information society at Jakarta.
“The city was not alone, she took her cars, trees, houses, she shall be on all that was on the land,” Nugroho said, adding that the flood had traveled over the open sea at 800 kilometers faster than she was on the beach.
Some climbed into a tree to get out of the flood, and survived, he said.
Around 16700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Palu.
Photographs from the air, which the hamlet agency published, showed many ruined buildings and shops, cables and useless bridges and mosques surrounded water.
After the attacks, we continued to ride across the beach on Saturday.
The earthquake occurred in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia’s establishment of food and technology use, said in a statement that the hurricane, which was released from an earthquake on Friday, had been about 200 times more than from the atomic explosion that fell on the city of Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which lies at the end of long and narrow floods, could have increased the size of the flood wave, said the institution.
Nugroho said the damage would be "real" and that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Also, some of the victims were found trapped under a cliff of rough buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the assault and property damage could be more along the shoreline 300 km north of Pala in a region called Donggala that is close to the shooting of the earthquake.
"Communicating" - just below and no information is received from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“A total of 300,000 people live there,” said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their employees and volunteers were on their way to the desired areas.
“It’s already hard, but it could be much worse,” the Red Cross said.
The organization was critical of many on Saturday for not knowing that the refugee had a school at Palu, although the public representatives said that the centuries had come within the time the product was issued.
In a video that was published on social media, a man could hear shouting from the upper floor buildings to warn the people on the street below that the floods were approaching.
Only a few minutes later, the coastal city of the beach and takes off with its construction and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the video immediately.
The earthquake and the flood surge caused electrical insurgents that prevented communication about Palu and made the authorities difficult for organizing helpers.
The army is starting to send aircraft with help products from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but people who have been helped by the area still need pain in food and other necessities to keep.
The airport of the city has only been opened again for help operations and will be closed in October.
Joko Widododo, president, is going to visit a refugee centre in Palu on Sunday.
The number of dead is over 800 after a flood in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
The World Vision staff from Donggala have reached the whole and the camp to the city of Palu, where it seeks shelter in campgrounds that were set up in the garden outside of their offices. Gereyinging was among them on the way, according to Mr Doseba.
“People said they’ve seen a lot of houses,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Helpers have started hard helping, but some have complained that foreign helpers with great expertise would be hampered from travelling to Palu.
According to the Indonesian regulations, foreign financing, supplies and staff can only begin to arrive if the accident area is informed of the territory.
It hasn't been done yet.
"This is still a local accident area," said Alia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
When the government has declared that this is a hemp area, we can open for foreign aid, but no statement has yet been made.”
When the second night fell upon Palu after the earthquake and the flood wave on Friday, friends and families still missing, in the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that would shed hope for the demeanors that follow natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from the start.
On Sunday, a woman who had been stuck under ruins for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, a coach of the Indonesian Refugee Team, had been coached by two swimmers, who are now missing, for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people who stayed inside the Roa Roa hotel were his students, including Mr. Monday.
“A man with a long experience in a sweat fly, I have my own emotional burden to carry,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said that the hour after the news was heard before the BEST group because Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he would have sent WhatsApp a message in despair to the contestants who stayed in Palu and participated in the beach festival.
His message, however, showed only a crying sign, instead of a blue.
“I think the message was not received,” he said.

Kanye West: Rapparn converts his name in Ye
Kanye West's rapper is going to change his name - in Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday and wrote: “The world that was previously known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the title as the title of the eighth album to be released in June.
The change comes for his participation in Saturday Night Live series where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He comes instead of Ariöna Grandi in the series, but she stopped because of “a sense of reason,” the producer said.
West has said that this name has a religious meaning for him, but it is also a shortening of his current name.
"I think that "yes" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," West said earlier this year when he talked about the name of his album with the radio director Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m we, that’s us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, and over in just Ye - to be just a reflection of the good in us, the evil, the ringing, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former collaborator West, has also written his name both with and without a band line and the highest.
The President of Mexico is called not to fight against the general public.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected President of Mexico, has been called to never use military forces against the general cities, now the country will soon be remembered 50th anniversary of the birthday of the blood-grained students.
On Saturday at the Tlatelolco square, Lopez Obrador promised that “not to mention the army ever to scrub the Mexican people.”
The soldiers attacked peaceful protests on the square on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing movements of students were shooting the root of all the Romanesque Americas.
Lopez Obrador has promised to assist young people in Mexico by giving all students monthly strength and opening up more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of education allowed young people to commit crimes.
The U.S. should double its financial resources to artificial intelligence
Now that China is working in the use of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount of money it holds in research in that field, says the inventor and intelligence user Kai-Fu Lee who has worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The report was reported after various U.S. governments issued reports on intelligence, even though the United States has no formal comprehensive plan on intelligence.
China announced its plan last year: it aims to be the first place in innovation with artificial intelligence by 2030.
“It would be a good start to double the money that goes into artificial research, considering that all other countries are so much further behind the United States, and we are waiting to see the next major discovery in the field of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
Double capital could double the probability that the next major discovery in the artificial price will be done in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in Face++, one of the main artificial intelligence companies in China.
He won the artificial system in the 9th century at Carnegie Mellon University, which won the best player of the United States in Othello, and later was the director of Microsoft Research and the President of the Chinese department at Google.
Lee spoke of previous technical competitions, held by the U.S. authorities, such as the robotics competition of the defense force, and asked when the next race would be held, to see the next launch.
Scientists in the United States often have to put a lot of effort into gaining strength from the government,” Lee said.
“It’s not China that likes its main concept, but the company,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have advised their students from universities to work on artificial intelligence over the past few years.
Lee said that changes to immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen its artificial research.
“I think those who have a doctor in artificial intelligence should have a residence permit automatically,” he said.
China announced its future plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides the funds for people who work at the university institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and similar public institutions doing in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Secretary of Defense set up an intelligence centre designed to cooperate with both industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the formation of special committees on intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced it would have invested 2 billion dollars in a project called AI Next.
As regards NSF, it invests over 100 million annually in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, U.S. legislation, designed to provide security for artificial intelligence, has nothing to go on for many months.
Macedonian voters vote on whether or not to change the name of the country
Citizens of Macedonia in the National Assembly on Sunday on whether or not to change the name of the country in the "Long North Macedonia" attempt to solve the decades-long analysis of Greece, which has closed their application for membership of the European Union and Nató.
Greece is ruled by the name of Macedonia, and it claims that their neighbour’s name in the Nordic equivalent requirement of their territory and therefore refuses them to enter Nató and EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June, based on the new name, while the nationalists maintain that the change will undermine the self-image of the majority of the inhabitants of Macedonia of Slavic origin.
Gjorge Ivanov, President of the United States, has said that he will not participate in the vote and campaign to ignore it has raised doubts that the participation will reach 50 percent of the minimum required for the vote.
The question of voting is: “Will you walk Nató and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Members of the name change, including Zoran Zaev, prime minister, say that this is a fair fee for Macedonia to gain membership of EU and Nató, but the country is one of those that was formed after the fall of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country for young people in Macedonia so that it can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79-year-old at Skopje.
Although the result is not legal binding, many Senators have said that they will go after it and bind it in law.
The name change would require the approval of two thirds of the Senate.
The Board of Directors said there had been no reports of anything unusual at 1 a.m. after noon.
However, the participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent of the last year's vote in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters paid their vote.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old president of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko paid their vote in the National Assembly of Macedonia on whether to change the country's name, but it would pay its way into Nató and Europe, in the Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Senate in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, won 54 years old, preparing a small field and setting up chairs in front of the tents that had been erected by those who will ignore the vote.
“We are loaded with Nató and the EU, but we want to be members of the head in a way that is not going through the service door,” Kavardarkov said.
“We are poor, but we live on the road.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonian, we can turn to China or Russia and become part of the European Union.”
Zaev Prime Minister says that Nató will bring the necessary funds to Macedonia, where the proportion of unemployed people is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the vast majority of people will agree that more than 80 percent of the country’s population is charged with EU and Nató,” Zaev said after paying his vote.
He said that consent would be “festing in our future.”
The survey that was published on Monday from the Research Institute Macedonia showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the National Assembly, but it is lower than the minimum required.
Another poll from Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents wanted to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent say yes.
So that the national referendum is expected to be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote is not approved, it could mean the first serious case for the direction of the government, which is linked to the Western countries, since it took place in May of last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, goes through all the products Brighton and shoes
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made their debut with Brighton in the Manchester City 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculous easily when he scored his mark in 65 minutes.
The Argentinian advance took over the broadcast in the middle of the course at the beginning of the application.
He spread out three defenders Brighton and then went out to the open.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green-clad defenders.
He led a defender and then ran away several times in addition to the illiterate Brighton.
Then he sent to the left and found there Sterling.
The English frontman used the first touch before the host to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to play at Mathew Ryan, markman Brighton, with shot in the right side of the field.
“Aguero has some foot problems,” said Pep Guardiola, chief executive of City.
“We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then it happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at this moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave them the first blue mark in the field.
The mark came in the 29th minute.
Aguero was sent a long way inside the vallarhelming of Brighton in that application.
He sent an elegant long ball to the left of the Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball several times and then sent to Sterling towards the spring rod.
Forward City sent the ball to the net just before he ran out of it.
City game against Hoffenheim at the Champions League at 12:55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Necker Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play slot games against Rockies
Since the National team has been excluded from playing in the league, there was no reason to force a second start.
But Scherzer hopes to throw on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies are still able to get a look, but they have a single game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the west.
Rockies had at least 5-2 wins at the Nationals on Friday night, but the team was still looking for their first division title.
“Even though we play free, we can at least play for the electro-powered atmosphere in Denver as well as the team that hit the team safely after playing their best game this year.
Why shouldn’t I want to compete in such a situation?”
Nationals still have to report who will be the first to be cast in the game on Sunday, but it is believed that they will let Scherzer throw to these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was about to start the game in 34rd time, took a workout on Thursday and would throw on Sundays that are usually rested with him.
This courthouse in Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 wind-cuts in 220 2/3 rounds at this time.
Trump Visits West Virginia
The president openly pointed out in the case of Kavanaugh, the committee’s Supreme Court judge when he spoke of the importance that supporters of the Republicans took part in the mid-season talks.
“It’s all in touch with November.
There are five weeks in one of the most important choices of our lives.
These are only of those big, big... I don't make up, but do it, because of this, I go about a huge struggle to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, “You see this horrible, radical group of demos, you can see it happening now.
And they are in a position to regain authority by any means needed, you see the cruel, evil.
They don’t care who they hurt, over who they have to go to power and control, they just want to gain power and control, we don’t give them it.
He said the Democrats were working to “keep and prevent.”
"And it has been seen in the last four days," he said, and said the demonstrably to be "the evil and cruel and untruthful."
He referred to the General Assembly chairman Diana Feinstein, the councillor of the Senate Senate, on the name, and was answered with a loud bulimia from the viewers.
“Do you remember her response?
Was that what you saw the document?
Hey, what?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The team is no longer a corrupt church.
He doesn’t like those who express his mind.
When Momentum's action in my class was to give me a suggestion, it was hardly surprising.
I am after all the last of many members of the working party who have been told that we are not welcome, just for expressing our mind.
Joan Ryan, my co-chairman, received similar treatment because she protested against Jews.
In my case, the opportunity to give me a suggestion was given because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The aim was to have a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, a coldly similar issue, and Jeremy was inconvenient in the past.
The announcement of the meeting for Nottingham East on Friday said: “We want the meetings to understand no outside and to be effective.”
In my eight-year career as a member of the Labor Party, Friday’s meetings have long been exactly that.
Unfortunately, it’s not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of “million and better” governance has been forgotten, if it started them ever.
It has become increasingly clear that different opinions are not at work, and that all opinions are judged as to whether the leaders of the group count them reliably.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when co-workers, who I thought before, had similar political opinions and I, was expected to expect that I would put an absolute approach and support opinions that I had never agreed before, whether there was a national security or a common EU market area.
Every time I speak publicly - and then it matters little what I say - it follows the insult of social media, which is called after my crime, the midfield politics rejected, and I said I shouldn't be in the Workers' Party.
This is not just my experience.
I know I’m more fortunate than some of my colleagues, where most of my comments are usually political.
I admire professionalism and confirm those who need to endure sexual or perpetuating insults every day but never hear.
One of the most disappointments of this political period is how aggressive and abusive are the words of a normal part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Workers' Party should be forced to take part in a controversial culture.
The reality is that we are no longer a seductive church, and with every vocacy or change in the election rules, the party will be slow.
I’ve had a lot of advice over the past two years to put a little on me, not too high, and it would be “all right” with me.
But I did not decide to participate in politics to do so.
From the time I became a member of the Workers' Party as a student 32 years ago, what about the abuse of the governments of Thatcher who left my school office after the end, I have fought for a better public service for those who need it most to hold, whether I was in the city council or on the Senate.
I've never hidden my political opinions, but in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my policies and where I disagree with current leaders.
For those who supported the proposals on Friday, I will only say that when the country is heading in Brexit, which will hurt our home, company and public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy in my loyalty to the leaders of the Workers' Party.
But my one message, which I want to send from me, is not for Nottingham Momentum, but to those within my constituency, whether they are members of the Workers' Party or not: I serve you with pride and I promise that there will be no doubt about the disparagement or political crime of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated team Ayr goes to the top
Two late snowfalls could have damaged the final stage, but there’s no doubt that Ayr had the victory in this great game of the day in the Tent’s Premiership division.
They are now in the top 10 of the list and the only team of ten still undefeated.
Finally, it was their stronger product and better use of opportunities that made homeowners the most successful and Peter Murchie coach had the right to be happy.
“We’ve got a tough attitude in our games here and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “A lot of compliments, they took their opportunity better than we do.”
Mark Grant Anderson came across in the 14th minute after Frazier Climo turned the application, but a yellow panel on the Scottish team, which was allowed to play the game with Warriors, allowed Melrose to let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot to score the touchmark.
Climo led the lead Ayr with a twist before scoring with a kick right for half-time and then a cross-country hit over 17-5 in half.
But Melrose started the second half of power and touchmark Patrick Anderson, after Baggot turned the application, reduced the mark difference to five points.
Since then, Gera needed a long time to speed up serious injuries at Ruardidh Knottt, who had to carry off the playoffs, and after that, Ayr still increased his lead with a touchmark from Stafford McDowall, after Climo turned the application.
Blair Macpherson, the leader of Ayr, was then given the yellow card and Melrose re-entered himself to be a man with a touchmark from Bruce Colvine, at the end of hard times.
However, homemen came back strong and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card for having an available Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored a touchmark for the rear of the Ayr application, after the extrapyrene.
Climo turned the search, as he did again immediately after the re-election, after Kyle Rowe succeeded David Amrstrong from the hospital and sent to Gregor Henry who scored the fifth touchout of the team.
Stjarna Still Game The participants ready for a new career in the restaurant
Ford Kieran, star Still Game, seems ready to move into restaurants after he realized he was the director of a restaurant company.
Kieran, 56-year-old, game Jack Jarvis in the BBC series popular, as he writes and plays along with his old friends from the entertainment industry, Creg Hemphill.
The incident has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last and so seems Kiernan’s plans for Craiglan’s life.
According to the official files, he is the CEO of Avengers Limited.
The actor didn’t want to say anything about the news, but the author Scottish Sun claimed that Kiernan wanted to become a participant in “living restaurant arabransa” Glasgow citizens.
“Our mission is: The shoreless country of Bolivia is hoping that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific Ocean.
Sailors stand guarded for the headquarters of the fleet in La Paz.
General buildings flag blue flag.
Beautiful stations from Titicaca waters to Amazon years are marked with the slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It’s our duty to restore it.”
In recent times, all of Bolivia’s landslides are reminiscent of the beach line, which lost to Chile in the blood of the 19th century, still in fresh memory - along with the desire to conquer the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes are perhaps the strongest for decades, now that Bolivia is waiting for a ruling from the International Court of Justice in The Hague on October 1 after five years of work.
“Bolivia lives over the power, unity, and absolutism, and, of course, is waiting for the ruling with a positive mind,” Roberto Calzadilla said.
Many residents of Bolivia will monitor the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens of all countries, in the hope that the Court of Justice in The Hague will abolish Bolivia in the interests of their claim that Chile is obliged to provide Bolivia with access to, after many decades of difficult relations.
The debate on Monday is also very important for Evo Morales, the president of the country of the Indian Senate, who will be in a re-election campaign next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said in late August.
However, some scholars consider it unlikely that the judicial district of Bolivia would be in a good position, and that it would be a little change if he did.
The Court of Justice, which is headquartered in the Netherlands, has no authority to give land from Chile and has said that the ruling will not affect the outcome of the possible claims.
The fact that the court’s ruling comes only six months after listening to the final speaker indicates that the matter “has not been complicated,” said Paz Sárate, an Icelandic expert in international law.
It is also possible that the last four years have not been the case with Bolivia, but have brought the country back.
"The current administration of Bolivia has stolen the issue of access to the ocean," Zárate said.
The words of Morales have drawn away all the blessings of Sille, she thought.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to discuss with you some time, but it will be very difficult after that.
The two countries have not been sent to the embassy since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former President of Bolivia and the representative of the country in The Hague, rejected the idea that the decision of the Court of Justice had taken an unusually short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will gain “a unique opportunity to open up a new relationship with Sile” and the opportunity to “connect an analysis that closes 139 years back in time, both countries to profit,” he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales, still one of the most popular forums in Latin America, was to use this issue as a political hedge.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The trial is an opportunity to see that we need to be equal in the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear weapons unless it can trust the United States.
Ri Yong Ho, the foreign minister of North Korea said the country will never take down its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
He held his speech on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow the promises they made in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
His statement is now Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State, seems to be starting a debate on nuclear weapons, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea.
Ri says that there are “dramas” to maintain continued trade negotiations and protest the U.S. against a declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever be a threat to North Korea.
Washington does not want to approve the statement unless Pyongyang first makes clear action to take down nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump want to meet again at another meeting.
However, it is clear that Pyongyang is serious about taking down weapons that the country probably looks at as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris introduce the latest line of large headwear that will come in fashion near you
If you want to expand your hat library or be completely hollow from the sun, you don’t have to look further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne exhibited a variety of styles for their SS19 line in the fashion field, which filled the fashion trend in Paris.
The number of images of many unearthed autumns has been published in Instagram this summer and these designers have had their innovative creations to display on fashion shows.
The main work of Valentino was a large light-brown hat with a wide range of features, similar to the feathers and hollow head of the almonds.
Of other accessories in the above size, watermelons can see sets of gemstones, seman hats, and even pineapples, but these things are not designed to keep heat on the head.
Thom Browne also introduced a variety of strange monsters, precisely at the right time for horror.
Many of the colourful monsters were with interspersed wolves, similar to Hannibal Lecter, but high.
A shell resembles a foaming device with a breathable pipe and glasses, while others resembled acute ice in the bread form.
If you want to be in the game, you are lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the hats might soon come into sale in the fashions near you.
Large hats bring a dose of heel -La Bomba," steeped with over 60cm large bearings that have drawn their head from Rihákowski to Emily Ratakijkowski.
The fashion note on the back of the unattainable hat, which was seen on all social media, was inspired by other major accessories that appeared in the fashion field — the beach floor of a high-slip that was almost the same as the healthy-weared piece that carried it.
The orange flag, with straps and a white handle of the leather, was the main part of the La Riviera SS10 line Jacquemus on the fashion scene in Paris.
Luke Armitage, a list of famous people, said in an interview with FEILM: “I expect to see big hats and beach jackets appear in fashion for the next summer - since the design has caused such a great impact should be difficult to ignore the demand for accessories in size.”
John Edward: Language skills are a necessity for world citizens
The University of Scotland is known for its excellent performance of its students and it has continued in 2018 with new, elegant test locations, which are still strengthened with individual and group competitions in sports, art, music and other community societies.
These schools have up to 30,000 students all over Scotland, with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (Skoska Private School, SCIS) in defense of them, and they compete to provide their students and parents with the best possible service.
Students are aiming to prepare their students under a rather advanced degree, the employee they have chosen and their status as a citizen of the world.
As a teacher who can put together and learn from special teaching programs, we see that the new language continues to be a popular study topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, it touches his mind.
If you talk to him in his mother tongue, it touches his heart.”
This is an important reminder that we can not only rely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of this year show us that language is at the top of the art with the highest proportion of students who achieve tests in private schools.
68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received the A.
The data collected from 74 schools within SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also received the A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign language as the necessary skills that children and young people will certainly need to keep in the future.
At the moment, languages, such as electives, are placed in the same place as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in private schools and elsewhere.
The survey design that was made in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that for the reasons that employers gave up on finding employment, 17 percent was because scores were on people with language skills.
Therefore, language recognition is becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for their future work.
Now that more jobs require knowledge in languages, these skills are essential in the native world.
No matter what careers people choose, it will have a real reputation in the future if it learns a different language, but it is a knowledge that ended out of life.
The ability to have direct communication with people from other countries will provide the personal data automatically for the purposes of the competitors.
According to the poll that YouGov made in over 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent of them could not speak another language well enough to maintain conversations, and French was the only language spoken by two characters of percentage, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for children to invest immediately in language learning.
Multilingual, especially in the new market, will provide children with a better opportunity to find an important job.
In Scotland, there is a difference between schools which language they teach.
The number of schools will focus on classical news, while others will teach languages that are considered important to the UK when viewed until 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interests lie, it will always be possible to choose from languages in private schools with specific acquaintances.
Scottish private schools commit themselves to offering a curriculum environment, which will prepare children and prepare them with the knowledge they need to achieve success, no matter what the future has with them.
It cannot be denied that at this time, in the global business environment, language continues to be necessary for the future of the country, and it must be reflected in education.
In fact, it should really look at modern language as “national knowledge in communication.”
Students will continue to offer choices, diversity and events for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards is the Chairman of the Scottish Private School
LeBron plays the first game for Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The game is soon to end for fans who want to see LeBron James play their first game for Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, coach Lakers, has announced that James will play on Sunday in the opening season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has not yet been decided how many minutes he will play.
"It will be longer than a minute and less than 48," Walton said on the official website of Lakers.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for Lakers, said on Twitter that James would probably play for a limited time.
After the training earlier this week, James was asked for his plans for the six game schedule of Lakers for the start of the season.
“In this period of my career, I don’t have to play games for the game season to prepare me,” he said.
Time limits for Trump's election in Western Virginia and YouTube channel
Donald Trump will hold a number of elections and the first one is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five organized meetings in the next week, where he will also stop at the vineyards, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his election to the new Supreme Court has been put in place, Trump has called for support for the next mid-term polls, because Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Senate when voting will be made in November.
What time is Trump’s election meeting in Western Virginia, and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to start at 19.00 a.m. east beach time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in Western Virginia online below through direct broadcast on YouTube.
It is also likely that Trump is indicting the trial of the court over Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court judge, where the allegations of sexual harassment are discussed by the FBI.
But the main goal of Trump is to help Republicans achieve better shape, but their wait for difficult elections in November.
For this reason, the message from Trump’s election campaign was that these five meetings, which will be held next week, have the goal of “filling volunteers and supporters of firearms, are attempting to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and in the Senate,” according to Reuters.
“The President’s plan is so important that he will travel to as many counties as possible, and now another campaign period will begin,” Trump said in a statement.
The meeting tonight will be held at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling and is expected to come from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and media from Pittsburgh,” according to the West Virginia Metro News.
The meeting on Saturday will be another visit to Trump's West Virginia this month, but he won by over 40 percent in this state in 2016.
Trump wants to help Patrick Morrissey, the leading Republican in Western Virginia to the Senate, but he is in the polls.
"It's not a good idea for Morrissey that the president needs to come and try to increase his popularity," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of Western Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Birch 2018: Let the United States show a struggle to keep the hope alive for the individual race on Sunday
After three single-sided rings, the fourth game, which was on Saturday, could be exactly what was needed in this race about the Ryder Cup.
Sveifir in success is a sports thought that has been invented and that players really believe, and never more than in the competition as this one.
Where would they say the success is now?
“They had six ladders ahead and now there are four points, so that the success lies on our side right now, I’m standing by,” said Jordan Spieth.
Europe, of course, has a predicament, four points ahead with twelve more in the hood.
The Americans, like Spieth said, consider themselves to have a little wind in the sails and they can be hopeful over many, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and got three points out of four.
Spieth has played a great deal of things to flirt and lead with his example.
The industrial revolution increased as a result of the ring, and he put down an important pad to feed all four levels of the game after he and Thomas had been two points below two games.
His father, who secured them a victory in the game of the 15th hole, ran a similar celebration, struck off the kind of man who says he believes that the American team has not yet won the victory.
“You just have to dive deep and think about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s the only thing that these players can do right now.
18 holes to win in points.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the undefeated story of Ryder the bishop.
This strange but breathtaking European couple has won four games of four and cannot do anything wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who got school on Saturday, but they also managed to avoid schooling on Saturday morning, afternoon on Friday, and on nine holes on Friday morning.
The game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the high audiences clearly shows that they are the couple who need to win on Sunday, and there would be no popular player to enter the potential victory of the European team but Fleetwood or Molinari, the sun is seen across the Le Golf National Stadium.
The best option would be to both do it at the same time on different holes.
It’s still too early to talk about the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went easy with Sergio Garcia, the fourth game of the morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
Schools and two doubles in the first nine holes dug out the Spanish and swan into a hole that they never got to scratch up.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The girls and the fourths are so exciting to watch in close proximity because of the relationships between the couple, their advice, the advice they don’t give and how the game plan can change in one know-how.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a considerable advance for the final day, but this fourth round also showed that the United States team is with the struggles that some had doubted that it had, especially other Americans.
Europe with 10-6 lead for the final day of the race on the Ryder Cup
Europe will be in good shape for the final day of Ryder’s victory after the fourth and fourth games of Saturday, with a score of 10-6 against the United States.
The starring Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over Tiger Woods, who was struggling and had four points at Le Golf National vellines.
The European team Thomas Bjorns, who would like to reach back the award car, which it lost to Hazeltine wells two years ago, showed a huge victory over the United States in the fourth quarter of the morning and won 3-1.
The United States showed more opposition in the fourth and won two games but failed to win the ladder.
Jim Furyks had eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the cup going.
Fleetwood is the first European team to win four points in a row and he and Molinari, who share the nickname “Moliwood” after the magnificent weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their first four games in the history of Ryder’s biker.
After finishing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourth series, they showed great teamwork and won the Woods and U.S. newly formed Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who took himself through two games on Saturday, showed his kind version uniquely, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in the fourth and fourth games, and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who was born for the fourth season of the morning, returned to her companion, Henriks Stenson in the fourth and won the 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are in the first and third place on the list of the best golfers in the world.
However, Europe did not go all the way to the garden of this mild and gustasam day southwest of Paris.
Three winners in a major golf game, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the mark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They struggled 2-1 against Jon Rahm from Spain and Ian Poulter in the fourth round and returned to battle with Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the fourth quarter after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of Ryder the bishop that the team has won four points will be at the start of an individual competition, but so that the team of Fyks would only need a tie to keep the bees going.
After being the next couple for two days, however, it seems that the data on Sunday will be too high.
North Korea says one-sided weapons of weapons - impossible" without trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea said on Saturday that the continued trade ban only sparked their lack of confidence in the United States and it would be impossible for the country to put down its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said in the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken action to show goodwill in recent years, for example by stopping nuclear and nuclear testing, taking down the nuclear test site, and promising to stop the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We haven’t seen any matching responses from the United States,” he said.
“With confidence in the U.S., there is no certain security of our country and under such circumstances it is impossible that we take our unilateral weapons down first.”
Although Ri has repeated the familiar North Korean complains about the resistance of Washington to “straighter” approach to nuclear weapons where North Korea would be rewarded for every step that it took, his statement seemed special in that way that he did not defunct the single nuclear weapons clean out as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri led to joint announcements by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the U.S. President and North Korean leader, in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim was named to work as "the North Korean nuclear weapons force" and Trump issued a promise to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea has been seeking solutions to bind the formal end of the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States has said Pyongyang will release its nuclear weapons after the first time.
Washington has also called for the relaxing of a strict trade ban against North Korea.
“The United States demands that “the nuclear weapons be first placed” and increased pressure by using the trade order to reach its end, and even protest the statement of ending the war,” Ri said.
“There are only dreams of people who don’t know anything about us to think that the customer can get us on a knee.
But the problem is that the continued customer support is increasing our confidence.”
There was no mention of the plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leaders spoke about last week.
The Prime Minister spoke instead of three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, South Korea’s leader for the past five months, adding: “If the party to this nuclear weapons treaty were South Korea instead of the United States, this would not be the case for nuclear weapons in Korea.”
Despite this, the tone of the speech of Ri is very different from his speech last year when he said in the General Assembly that it was impossible to target a rocket from North Korea to the United States after “the Devil’s President” Trump called Kim “a wolf bomber” in suicide.
Last year, Trump called on the North Korea, but this year he praises Kim with the United Nations for his courage to take a step towards disarmament, but said that a great deal of work was still left and that the trade deal would continue until North Korea had destroyed all its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame and said, “if it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say that the Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State at the Security Council on Thursday said: “The Security Council must continue until a total nuclear weapons attack has taken place and it confirmed.”
The Security Council agreed to increase its trade agreement with North Korea in 2006 to close the funding for the Pyongyang nuclear and fire-fire plans.
Pompeo met Ri on the side line of the General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times a year, but his last trip did not go well.
He went from Pyongyang in July and said that success had been achieved, but only a few hours later, North Korea condemned him to do “bad demands.”
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to take down a rocket zone and a nuclear station if the United States intervened to "consolidate action."
He said that Kim had said that the “conformities” he was looking for were assurances of security that Trump promised in Singapore and actions towards normal relations with Washington.
Students in Harvard take part in a good rest
New courses at Harvard University have provided all students with more sleep in an effort to track against growing tendency students to watch and learn all night with the help of caffeine.
Research revealed that students at the best university in the world often know little when it comes to thinking about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor at Harvard Medical School, and an expert at Brigham and the Women’s Hospital, studied the course and believes it is the first species of its kind in the United States.
He had the idea of doing the course after reading the effects of sleep cards.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why did I say this first now, in my final year?’”
She said no one would have told her anything about the important sleep that surprised me,” he said.
The course, held for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help learning and performance in sports and promote even general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School, said that the university had decided to present the course after learning that students were asleep over the week.
The course is a clock time to length and includes various interactive tasks.
In one part, a picture of a room at home, where students click on coffee balls, windows, sports shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sports can worsen sleep, along with an important good red light for sleep.
In other parts, participants are told how to reduce sleep to a long time may increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
Map of the school area with interactive symbols then encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of the students.
But we feel that they have the right to know this, just like a man on the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture that celebrates those who watch and learn all night is still present, he said, adding that modern technology and filter pressure on students meant that sleep cards would be a growing problem.
Ensuring that getting enough sleep of good quality should be “extreme weapons” students to protect stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said — even to avoid getting fit, because sleep cards increase the call for the brain about food so that the body is a phonegile.
Raymond So, 19-year-old professor of chemistry and physics from California, helped Professor Czeisler put the class together, but he sat one of the cowboy professors in his first year in Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for classes for all students in the school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all the Masters to complete a similar course before they start college.
Professor Czeisler said that students are interested in setting the alarm clock, which reminds them to go to sleep, and to wake them up, and to keep in mind the harmful effects of blue light that electronic screens and LED lights give off, but it can confuse the inner clock of the body and lead to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark from Menga cloud down men Gerards
Rangers still struggled at the outdoors, the team led by Steven Gerrards had to accept a 1-0 loss on Livingston, after the goal of Dolly Menga.
The song Ibrox wanted to reach his first win on the outfield after his victory at St Johnstone in February, but team Gary Holt gave the team Gerrard's only second loss in 18 games as the manager. The team is now eight points after Hearts, which is in the top place of the Ladbrokes Premier Division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the semi-final and team Rangers seemed to score all the inspiration and was never likely to equal.
The Rangers now fall into the sixth place, but Livingston goes up to the third and is only on Hibernian in the field.
Rangers could have suffered further trouble after the lineman Calum Spence had to get an axe due to head injury after some item was thrown into it from the vallarhelming gestures.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that pulled Ayr off and came into the final spot in the Betfred Bible.
Holt, on the other hand, remained with the same Livi 11 installation that reached the level of Hearts last week and he had been pleased with how well-trained his teammates were holding over the asspynu.
The Rangers were perhaps more with the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the ball it got.
They should have scored only two minutes after the first move from Menga came Scott Pitman in front of the mark Allans McGregors, but he shot ahead.
The song of Keaghan Jacobs later ended with Craig Halkett, a Alan Lithgow, his defense partner cut out the spring rod.
The Rangers regained control of the game, but were more likely to live in hope than believe in their play in the final stages of the game.
Alfredo Morales really felt that he should have gotten caught up when the fourth quarter was played by the game, when he and Steven Lawless joined together, but Steven Thomson's judge claimed the Crucifixion.
Rangers only managed to take two shots to the ground in the first half, but Liam Kelly, former goalkeeper Ibrox, did not need to have much for defending the shell from Lassana Coulibaly and easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Even though the opportunity from Livi in 34 minutes had come despite the fact that the team had the upper hand, no one can deny that they deserved it, but not only because of their perpetratorship.
Rangers failed to do anything from a long-lasting Jacobs boost.
Scott Arfield did not fail when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his calm and chose to send on Menga who then easily scored.
Gerrard took the lead in half and sent Ryan Kent into instead of Coulibaly and the exchange had an effect near the time the rear guard came Morelos in, but Kelly quickly failed and ran out to close the shot.
Livingston continued to fool the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoy playing and Lithgow and Halkett caught each long shipment on one foot.
The song Holts could have increased their lead in the final minute, but McGregor was successful in denying Jacob's chance before Lithgow ran to mark from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, an officer of Rangers, wanted to get another dimension, and Jacobs fell down, but Thomson turned it back.
Almanak: The man who invented the Geiger counter
Here’s a magazine page from our almanaki “Sunday Morning”: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and ÁFRAM... this is the day that the future engineer John Wilhelm —Hiss” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of measuring radioactivity and the invention ultimately led to a device called Geiger.
Geiger’s measurement has gained solid attention in the scientific world since it was also popular in the pop culture, for example in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado,” starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in various roles as researchers:
“What’s wrong with that?”
Rogers: “This is Geiger measuring, used to find radioactive material on board uranium.
When you put these headphones on you, you can hear the effects of the atoms because of the radioactivity in the rocks."
Evans: “It really works now!”

The invention that bears his name continues.
New vaccines against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells
New vaccines against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to know dangerous cells as part of the treatment
The treatment involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
Then they can “seat” proteins, which are common in many cancer cells, and then injected back to the patient.
In patients suffering from different types of cancer, a patient has shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months. The vaccine teaches immune cells to know dangerous cancer cells.
The procedure involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory so that they can “seat” proteins called HER2 and are found in many types of cancers. Then the cell is injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the United States of America at Bethesday, Maryland said: “Our findings suggest that the vaccine is effective.”
HER2 “lowers various types of cancer risk growing,” including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung and rift and endometrium, said Berzofsky, a professor.
Similar methods in which immune cells are taken from patients and those ‘non-communicable’ to treat cancer cells have worked in the treatment of one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West took a long speech to support Trump and carried MAGA there after appearing on the SNL television series.
It didn't end well.
At the Kanye West studio in Saturday Night Live, the film was followed by a long-running speech in which he praised Donald Trump’s U.S. President and said he would go forward to president in 2020.
After moving the third team of the evening, Ghost Town, where he wore Make America Great derhufu, he spoke long against the demos and repeated his support for Trump.
“I’ve talked so often to white people who say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
“If I were worried about racial hatred, I would have been a long time away from the United States,” he said.
SNL began the show with a stick in which Hollywood star Matt Damon made a joke to the testimony of Bretts Kavanaughs for the House of Representatives because of allegations by Christine Blasey Ford about sexual harassment.
Although West had not been released, it was set up by social media by Chris Rock.
I don’t know if Rock wanted to make a joke about West by publishing the recordings.
West also complained to the viewer that he had received a bad reception due to his hiatus.
“I was in the middle of the scene.
They said to me, “Don’t go into the field with this man.”
They made me alone!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, according to the news from Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the deep hole?” and said he would put on his superhumanistics, “Why does that mean you can’t make me work? Do you want the world to reach the fronts?
Try the love.”
His remarks were met with buli from the viewers at least twice, and players SNL seemed shameless, according to Variety, and one presenter said to the newspaper: “There was a stone silence in the studio.”
West had been invited to join the stage of singer Ariönu Grande, but her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West was surprised by his performance, he sang the song I Love It, dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received the support of the Candace Turner, the form of the unity of the TPUSA, but she said on Twitter: “To one of the bravest souls: DO NOT BE ANSWER.
Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was simply being “thann himself and it’s wonderful.”
“But I chose to reward NOT someone (with the purchase of his music or clothing or support his “list”) that I feel like supporting and spreading ideas that are harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are, too," she added.
For the show, the rapper reported on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that now he was “the man who was previously known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and feet in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion and cannot forget the music legend Prince the name, who changed his name in signs and later called himself the artist who was previously known as Prince.

Kit Harington, the star of the Cowboys, criticizes the poisonous male
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent adventures of HBO, the horrors.
The player, 31 years old, has criticized the scene of male heroism and says that such a role in the screen population means that young boys often find that they need to be hard to gain respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that “something had gone wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem that a toxic male is at #MeToo period.
Kit, who recently married his co-star from the Cowboys, the 31st-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had “strong opinions” on how to deal with this issue.
“Perhaps I feel at the moment, what’s going on with the men’s shoes?”
“What have we taught men in their growth, about the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that the TV is responsible for the rise in toxic maleism, due to the absence of male characters on television.
He continued: “What’s up and what’s taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets that make young boys feel like they must be determined by a man?
I think it’s one of the most important questions of the debate, how do we change this?
It is clear that something has gone wrong with young men.”
He also admitted in the interview that he would not play in any other race after the show's next summer and said he would have received "some of the moats and horses."
From November to November, Kit will play in a remake at True West, a film by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of film producer and his brother who is a robber.
The actor recently said that the best thing about playing in the scenes was to have his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife in this episode, so they gave me somehow my future family and my life after that,” he said.
Rose starred Ygrette, a love girl Jon Snow who Kit played in this Emmy Awards.
The couple married in June 2018, on a family of Lesliar in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces 14% increase in new infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people infected by the HIV virus or have been killed.
Health authorities say that over 800,000 people are infected in the country.
More than 40,000 new infections were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new infections are worn with sex, which is a change from what was before.
In the past, HIV virus rapidly spread into some parts of China because of the supply of infected blood.
The number of people infected by the HIV virus in this way has again fallen to almost zero, as Chinese health professionals said at a conference in Yunnan.
However, the number of people infected with HIV virus or death has increased by 100,000 people from year to year.
HIV abuse caused by sex is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Sexual orientation has not been illegal in China since 1997, but a huge discrimination against LGBT people is still going on.
Due to the domestic law in the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men are forced to end a woman.
Many people get sick because of the lack of capacity in these marriages.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised access to all HIV drugs as part of a plan to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses that an employee has leaked data from the Republicans Republican Republicans, criticizes “dangerous lies” and “communicated”
Maxine Waters, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, refused on Saturday that one of her employees had published personal information of three Senators of the Republican Party on their Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party said that these statements came from “often-risk” extremists and websites.
"Laws, lies and more miserable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published included domestic addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published online on Thursday from unknown parties at Capitol Hill during interrogations held at the House of Commons at Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court of Justice, due to allegations of sexual harassment.
At some point, the elders of the three had overheard Kavanaugh.
At Gateway Puritt and RedState, the IP addresses identified by the sources of information were associated with the Waters office and published information about one of its employees, according to information from Capitol Hill.
“This unsolicited excuse is absolutely wrong and pure lie,” Waters continued.
“My boss - what personal data and security are now at risk because of these wrong allegations - is in no way responsible for this information leak.
This unsolicited excuse is totally wrong and pure lie."
Waters was quickly criticised online, including Ara Fleischer, former White House news reporter.
“This denial is full of anger,” wrote Fleischer.
“It indicates that she did not have the ability to sit in the Senate.
When someone is accused of reason, do not react with anger.
You can't show opposition.
You can’t ask for the reasons for that.
It has to show calmness and overpower.”
Fleischer seemed to compare water's reaction to criticism of Kavanaugh's judges, who said critics had been too angry at the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a leading Republican against Waters in the mid-season polls, also said his opinion on Twitter.
"Stroke if true," he says.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had allowed “preserving authorities and law enforcement officers to know of these unsolicited claims.
“We will ensure that the rest of the meetings will be held,” she continued, “and that they will be sent to the cause of all their actions that are damaging and dangerous to all my employees.”
Filmography for Johnny English Strikes Again - Novel Picture with Rowan Atkinson Trying Powerful
It has become a habit of now searching for Brexit movies in all new films in which Britain comes to history, and it seems to be in this re-lived Johnny English horror series - which began in 2003 with the film Johnny English and just woke back to life in 2011 with the film Johnny English Reborn.
Is this a matter of how clearly miserable we are to be a new export tool for the country?
Whether it is or not, the other publisher, the court and the claustrophobic Johnny English have been granted a renewed license for the second time to clothe everything - his name shows beyond all that he is a creation engineer designed for exhibition in other English countries.
He is, of course, the scientist who pretends to live over a thrilling personality, but is a deadliest mix of Clouseau, despite Mr Bean and a little deleted by the man who played one night for the Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and mysterious world citizen, whom Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, where he understood everything in anger.
It’s one or two good things in this latest Johnny English film.
I enjoyed seeing Johnny English walking to a helicopter wearing a midwifery and a helicopter's skull in his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his brilliantness, but the humor seems rather forceless and strangely superficial, especially already “real” films such as James Bond and Mission Impossible films also offer a flawless look at the greens.
The green seems rather intended for children than adults and I felt the adventures that Johnny English suffered in not as an ideaful and focused as the silent gritty of Atkinson in the germany of Mr Beans.
The most important aspect of the film is that the UK is in great trouble.
The computer crash has managed to break into the secret spy of the UK and emerges about the identification of all the British spies, to a huge amphibians for the spies who are on the guard - but there Kevin Eldon is unfortunately in too little role.
This is the final battle for the Prime Minister who is horrified and surrounded by characters and when in great pains due to the enormous political enemies: Emma Thompson does his best with the role of a person who reminds Theresu May, but the script is not on many fish for it.
Her advice tells her that all active spies are at risk and that she must find someone who has been sitting in a sacred stone.
And there himself comes Johnny English to the story, now the school manager in some fine school, but also provides secret teaching in how to be a novice: here are some funny brands English offers a Christmas school reminiscent of the School of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall at an emergency meeting and meets where Bough, the former long-running companion, who Ben Miller plays again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine manager, but in that energetic role near Vicki Pepperdine did not quite let his light shine.
The Njóstvík who is wearing everything in her service is now back in the gear and meets the high-ranking Opheliu Bulletovu, who is played by Olgu Kurylenko.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is at the heart of the horrors of the fascinating billions of dollars in technology, which can be solved by the United Kingdom’s computer industry: that’s Jason Volta, the game of Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their horrors: they turn into fine French restaurant dubbs as servants, they cause violence, they sneak into the luxury bag of Volta, and English turns everything into a vault when he tries to use virtual reality glasses to introduce himself into the house Volta.
There is nothing to be saved in that final item, but the picture is beautiful and energyful, although some of its children own it in their entirety.
Medium-sized material.
And just like the Johnny English pictures, I couldn’t do anything but think: can the British filmmaker let Rowan Atkinson get the role that really suits his abilities?
The team refuses to create a plan for four days of work for Breta, with the same laps as for five days a week.
The team, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is now considering the root plan that would allow Bret to work for four days a week, but get paid for five.
According to the party, companies want to use savings generated from the revolution in artificial intelligence, and allow employees to benefit from getting one extra holiday.
The staff can enjoy three days of weekends, without falling into the lanes.
Homeowners say that the idea would “pass” to the economic plan of the class and his strategy to improve the interests of the workers.
Trades Union Congress has briefed the growth of work for four days, as a way for workers to make changes to the economy.
The head of the National Workers’ Party said on Sunday Times: “It is expected to be announced on a policy review for the end of the year.
“The movement will not be in one night, but four days of labor is the aim of the approach of the class to change the economy in the interests of the workers and the overall economy of the class.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support this idea, but the Green Party promised four days of work in its 2017 election campaign.
The goal, however, is not short of the company’s overall work.
The spokesperson of the Workers' Party said: “The future days of work are not on the policy board and the party is not considering entering it.”
John McDonnell, the Minister of Economic Affairs, used the Conference of the Workers' Party last week to describe his ideas about social change within the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the “novice forums” and “resources” providers.
The plan of the shadow minister also translates that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not have their whole share back as the government of the Workers' Party could put it on the “dark” because of the intended iniquities.
He has also confirmed plans to put employees in the board of directors of companies and to create a common asset fund to allow 10 percent of their own private businesses to staff, which could receive 500 pounds a year in their pocket.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say “60 minutes” whether a study of the FBI at Kavanaugh could get them to change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the investigations against Brett Kavanaugh prosecutors has caused at least a week-long delay in the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court, and raises the question of whether her findings could get the Senate senators back.
In an interview that will be shown on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a reporter in the episode, asked "60 minutes" Republicans and Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could lead something to make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his college from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” said Kennedy.
“I said when the trial began, I said I spoke to Kavanaugh judges.
I called him after the allegations were made and asked, “Do you think that?”
He was a certain, determined, unconquered.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to be unchanging.
“I have made my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it would have an incredible excuse to change it,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it instead,” Graham added and told Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone she mentions on her name couldn’t confirm it.
This is 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new will change.”
What is the international celebration and has she done something to reduce poverty?
The International Citzen Festival (Global Citizen Festival) will be held on Saturday in New York. It is an annual musical event in which series of big stars will come forward and with an impressive strategy; to end poverty worldwide.
This is the seventh year that the International Campaign is held and the tens of thousands of people will fly to Central Park, not only to listen to musical events including Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise attention to the real goal of the festival to end suffering poverty by 2030.
The International Civil War, first held in 2012, is part of the global poverty project (Global Poverty Project), but there are international organizations that want to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (except for those who want to pay for VIP tickets), composers needed to complete various tasks, or “functions”, such as working a volunteer, sending an email to some of the leaders of the world, calling phone calls or using other valid ways to help raise attention to their goals of binding on a few devices.
But how much success has the festival achieved, now 12 years are going to reach the goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with free music in a real way to convince people to call for action, or is this just a so-called “smelling” — since people feel it does matter by signing the online claim list or sending a message on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011 it has registered over 19 million “functions” from its supporters, to call for a variety of different objectives.
It says that these actions helped bring the leaders of the world to describe debt obligations and policies equivalent to over 35 billion valleys that will affect life over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In 2018, the group considered up to 390 commitments and notifications due to its actions, including investments or collecting at least 10 billion dollars.
The group plans that the money collected has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
One main commitment comes from The Power of Nutrition, which is a social investment and manager of the UK who works to “help children to enjoy their fullness,” promising to provide 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country, after drilling 4700 messages on Twitter from Global Citizen.
“With the support of the UK government, the strengthening of governments, governments all over the world and international citizens like you, we can let it social injustice that is a matter of ignorance to the past,” said Tracey Ullmann, a representative of The Power of Nutrition at the London Festival in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5000 calls were sent to the UK, the UK should improve food for mothers and children, announced the government on funding projects, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
In the list of common questions on the website of the group, one question is: “Why do you think you can put an end to poverty?”
Global citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult task - sometimes we will lose our lives in the process.
But, we will reach our roofs, just like the movements that are to be fought for the rights of citizens and the exploitation of racial segregation before us, because we are stronger together.
One of the events of this year is Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe. The event will be held in New York and the promoters are Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the seaman as a “hungry” to prevent Russia’s energy exports,” the Prime Minister said.
"If necessary," Washington could use the seaman to prevent the collapse of Russia's territory on the market, including in the Middle East," said Ryan Zinke, U.S. Secretary of State, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed to assist Russia with Syria, especially where the country works in the available legitimate government there, would be a burden to explore the new market.
“I think the reason for their existence in the Middle East is that they want to do business with energy such as in East Europe and its southern regions,” he said.
And, according to the official announcement, there are ways and methods to track it.
“The United States can use the seaman to ensure that seafarers are open and to form obstacles, if necessary, to ensure that the hurricane from them does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke called for a gesture of agreement to be offered to the Consumer Energy Alliance, which is a good group that calls itself “red energy” in the United States.
He continued and carried the approach of Washington to deal with Russia and Iran and told her to be more or less the same.
“The economy option for Iran and Russia is more and less profitable for energy supplies and replacing them for others,” he said, saying, Russia has only one game in the economy that would depend on fossil fuels.
The announcement comes after Trump’s government wants to increase its exports to Europe and to arrive in Russia, which is a cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, public officials in Trump’s administration, and including Donald Trump’s President, tried to get Germany to stop participating in the “opposite” North Stream 2 project to put new energy sources, which Trump says would make Berlin “catch” Moscow.
Moscow has held that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 energy supply, which will double the transport capacity of the current route up to 110 billion square metres, is a purely economic task.
Russia says that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we can’t be a tool to push pressure and that consumers should be able to choose for the suppliers,” said Aleksandr Novak, Minister of Energy Russia after meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. Secretary of Energy in Moscow in September.
The United States has been criticized by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to exchange energy policies between Berlin and Moscow.
“I am very disappointed that the foreign state changed its energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting held recently with Angelu Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, and Vladimir Putin, President of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will “think seriously” to go forward to the 2020 presidential election, she says.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, said on Saturday that she would “think seriously” go to the president after the mid-season polls.
Warren confirmed that she would consider offering a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and our government, and then we need a woman as a leader,” she told The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will consider seriously offering myself to the President of the United States."
Warren spoke of Donald Trump’s president at the meeting and said he was “doing with the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been outraged by his criticisms at Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for his Supreme Court.
On Friday, Warren said on Twitter, “We need to let the FBI investigate the matter before the vote comes out.”
However, the survey design published on Thursday shows that the majority of the voters in the Warrens state do not feel that it should be presented in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ voter voters said that the Senate senator should not be presented, according to the poll published by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent said they supported their offer.
The survey showed more support for the election of Deval Patrick, the former Governor of the United States, with 38 percent of respondents supporting his possible offer and 48 percent said they were against it.
Among other popular demos that were discussed for the possible presidential election in 2020 were Joe Biden, former Vice President of the United States, and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
Biden said he will make a public decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the harassment of Track Palin at the presidential meeting of Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26 years old, was in Iraq for one year after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with home violence on Monday night.
“My son is going through a lot of difficulties after coming back, I find myself with other families who find the impact of stress disorder and the spiritual pain that our soldiers return home with,” she said at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the man in the room” and said that her son and other warriors “come back only differently, they are tough and wonder if anyone is worthy of what their companions in the army and the air forces and other military forces have done for the country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, in order to try to prevent the notification of home violence and for weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the police department in Wasilla.
18 states and Washington D.C. support challenges against new asylum seekers
Eighty-seven states and Washington support legal challenge against new U.S. policy that refuses victims fleeing the return or home violence of asylum.
The representatives of 18 and the city filed a court report on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers protesting the policy, according to news from NBC News.
The full name of the defendant in Grace v. Session’s law that the American Civil Liberties Union has not been given.
She said that her husband “and his violent sons who were raped,” had raped her, but the U.S. government officials seized her application for asylum on July 20.
She was held in Texas.
The plaintiffs who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries where problems related to exchanges and home violence are increasingly expanding. The number of asylum seekers to the U.S. come from these countries.
The new asylum seekers call for a ruling that the applicant committee had set up in 2014 to allow unsubstantiated immigrants as a flying home diploma to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, a Washington government official, said on Friday that the new policy “has over decades of government and international law.”
“Albanian law requires a decision on all asylum applications based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this rule,” the statement said.
The police also said in the report that the policy that refused immigrants for entry was harmful to the economy of the United States, and thought that immigrants were more likely to establish a company and to maintain an important workforce.
Jeff Sessions, a government official, ordered court rulings in foreign affairs to stop giving asylum to victims who fled home victims and returned to Afghanistan in June.
“Those who leave their home country because of persecution based on gender, religion, nationality or membership of a particular community group or political review may apply for asylum,” Sessions said in a statement on 11 June.
Military divisions were never intended to solve all problems, not even all the serious problems that people text every day around the world.
A desperate rescue operation in a race to find survivors in Palu, is reported to have doubled.
Reasons will be more difficult for those who experience it.
"There's a lot of excitement in the air," said Risa Kusuma, 35-year-old mother, she cut off her sick son in the center of the city of Palu.
“The nurses come with a body here in the middle of the day.
There is little water.”
The inhabitants were seen returning to their deserted homes and looking in their waters to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people injured and hospitals are overcrowded and damaged after the earthquake that measured 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered back and shoulder fractures, were low outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were exposed due to continued force after earthquakes.
His eyes were filled with his eyes, he said about how he found the earthquake shaking his hotel on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I pushed up to the walls, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, saying his family had been in town to go to a wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Secretary of State sues China for "offenders" with "priority threats"
Shortly after the official press release in China published a four-day announcement in the U.S. newspaper to discuss the benefits of trade between the two countries, U.S. ambassadors in China accused Beijing of using U.S. media to spread the world’s media.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, spoke on Wednesday about the announcement of the Chinese newspaper Des Moines Register, which is the most widely published newspaper in Iowa, after saying China is trying to interfere with the U.S. presidential election that will be the 6th of November. China denies this attempt.
Trump’s investigation that Beijing wanted to merge into the U.S. Senate market what the U.S. representatives said was a new rise in expansion campaign from Washington to apply China’s pressure.
While it’s normal for foreign governments to publish ads to push for business, Beijing and Washington have a call for a trade war, with new customs to import goods both countries.
China’s Chinese and American experts say that revenge interpreters in China early in the trade war were designed to harm immigrants in the counties such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party’s Trumps.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, but that state flows out a lot of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had injured U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad said in his press release in the Sunday newspaper Des Moines Register that “China was now increasing its persecution by publishing reflections in our own free media.”
“In order to spread its interest, China’s government is to use its beloved freedom of expression to the United States and our free media by publishing the cost of advertising in Des Moines Register,” Branstad said in his statement.
“A lack of protests can be found in newspapers on the streets of Beijing, and no true reflection can be found on the different opinions that Chinese people could have had on the economic policy of China, where the media are stuck under the heels of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the biggest news outlets in China came out of the offer to publish” his article, but he did not know which newspaper it was.
Experts suggest that the Republicans are making female voters take care of them for the mid-term sessions with the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned against negative reactions, especially from women, in the next mid-term polls, because many Republicans have short and warned Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court judge, who has accepted the allegations of sexual harassment.
A lot of strong feelings have been around this issue and most Republicans have already shown in public that they wanted to begin voting.
“It’s not possible to cross with these things,” said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School in Syracuse, The Hill for an article released on Saturday.
Reeher said that calling Jeff Flake, the Senate Senator's Republican Republican Republican, in Arizona, last minute about a study by FBI dugi to calm voters.
“Connor will not forget what happened yesterday, they don’t forget it tomorrow and not November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief executive and spokesperson for free-minded group MoveOn, on Friday, according to Washington D.C..
On Friday morning, suing protesters “November is approaching!” they protested the elders’ march when the Republicans who ruled the ruling committee decided to continue with the nomination of Kavanaughs, despite testimony Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
“The interest and enthusiasm of voters will go out of all power,” said Stu Rothenberg, independent political critic at the news web site.
“People will say that the interest has already been great and that’s true.
But he could be more, especially with female voters in the districts and younger voters, 18-29, who like the president, but rarely vote."
The investigators predicted a backlash if the Republicans were to confirm Kavanaugh, even for the testimony of Ford, where she described her attempts on sexual harassment from him.
“It’s been a big surprise for the Republican Party,” said Michael Still, former member of the Republican Party, early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the votes of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be left in the class, it’s also about how Republicans have dealt with this and how they’ve made it,” said Guy Cecil, Chairman of the Priories USA, a group that helps vote for them, at the news station.
However, Americans seem to disagree with who should believe in the testimony of both Ford and Kavanaugh, and the majority of them support the latter.
A recent survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents probably believed or probably the testimony from Ford, while 35 percent said they probably believed or probably witnessed Kavanaughs.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said Kavanaugh had probably or certainly lied to his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the appeal from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations presented by Ford and from at least one other woman, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian news.
Ford carried the testimony before the Senate Senate Senate last week and said Kavanaugh had advised her when she was 17 years old and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says Kavanaugh had taken her genitals in front of her when they were both in a party that was in Yale University in the 9th century.
The man who invented the internet has plans to start a new internet to fight against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the network, is planning to set up a sporadic company to fight Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the technology platform, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, open-label Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people have permission to access any information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said in a joke that the position behind the Inrupt was “home affairs”.
“We have to do this now,” he said.
“This is a historical moment.”
The program uses technology from Solid to enable people to create their own “personal data store online” or POD.
There you can find a list of contacts, project list, calendar, music museum and other personal and work-related devices.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all located in one browser and all at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal data store is that it is completely below the user’s arrival which can access any information.
The company calls it “personal choice by using data.”
According to John Bruce, the CEO of the company, Inrupt is the idea that the company provides access, process and appropriate knowledge to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Now the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several programs that were hired to work in the project, and a group of volunteers in volunteering.
As of this week, technology developers around the world could create their own independent application with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team should not be in a relationship with “Facebook and Google whether to get out of place an absolute change that would put their current business share on the head in one night.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a article published on Saturday at Medium that Inrupt would have “the goal of creating energy in business and ecosystem that helps protect the honesty and quality of the new web based on Solid.”
Berners-Lee surrounded the network in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the discussion of the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee will continue to become the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even while he comes Inrupt on foot.
“I’m full of optimism for the next season of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The Presbyterian and the Duchess of Victoria from the First World War
The only English priest to be honored with the Victorian Cross in the first world war that a soldier has been hailed in his hometown 100 years later.
Special Bernard Vann, who took over the position of the commander of the army, received the cross on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he killed the sniper four days later, and he never knew that he had been the highest honor of the British Army.
Two of his nephews uncovered a memorial for him in a skyscraper in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his nephews, Michael Vann, said that it was “unlikely symbolic” that the memorial was revealed exactly 100 years from his honorary performance.
According to London Gazette, Vann led his understaffed army on September 29, 1918, over the Canal de Saint-Quentin's ruling, "through the affluent thick and under heavy shootings from fallbys and machine showers."
Later, he ran the line and with “a lot of courage” brought him the line forward before he attacked the fall of his team and overturned three soldiers.
The attack was killed by German snipers on 4 October 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his heroic grandfather was “something I could never do, but something that makes a man humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid the flower basket after the tailoring, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he “a great honor to participate in the fashion trip” and added that “the true heroes are shown with the support that so many show.”
MMA fans woke up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead of seeing Gurru grís
Just imagine, having woken up all night to see the overwhelming Bellator 206, just to be denied seeing the main event.
The following day, 13 battles were held from San Jose, six of which were broadcast all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 o’clock in the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British viewers had an unexpected appearance when the broadcast changed to Gurru grís.
Some were unhappy after waking up all night to watch the battle.
One fan on Twitter described the split into the children’s topic as “any kind of sick joke.”
“Consecutive official rules were not the subject of the spectators at six o’clock in the morning so they had to switch into children’s material,” said Dave Schwartz, Vice President of Marketing and Communications for Bellator, when he was sent out to the broadcast.
“Great rice, yes.”
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said they would go over their schedule and take viewers in the UK with the account in the future.
“I think when I think about the rethink that we could probably get rid of it,” Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning and we can’t get out of it until Sunday to our day, which is Monday with them.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, many text messages were sent back and forth, and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t that, it was a public problem.
I can promise it won’t happen next time.
We limit the night to five battles instead of six, as usual, but we tried too much and went out of us.
It’s a bad situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley found for “advantage” because of sexual orientation
The Olympian Tom Daley said he had been dissatisfied with other people in his growth because of his sexual orientation, but that it had encouraged him to succeed.
The 24-year-old Daley said that he was not aware that “he was different from others” until he went to college.
In the TV show Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 channel, starring Lauren Laverne, Daley said he spoke about the rights of homosexuals to provide others “von.”
He also said that the parents’ role has attracted his interest in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular member of the board, has taken a few months of vacation due to illness.
Daley appeared in the first episode of Laverne and said that he had found him “a little man” but everyone else when he was a child because “it wasn’t accepted in society to be liked by both boys and girls.”
He said: “All until the present day, these feelings about finding out I’m untrue and different have given me the power and strength to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so that he would not cause any disappointment when he finally came up with his sexual orientation.
The double Olympics have made a great deal of effort as a supporter of LGBT and used their participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more nations to prosecute homosexuals.
He was told to hear because he found himself lucky to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to give others “von.”
The World Champion tripled that it would have "come him surprised" to fall in love with the man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who he first met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he, earlier than he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When a man walks through such a great age," he joined his first Olympic Games 14 years later, and his father died from cancer three years later, he said it was difficult to find equal opportunities that would have experienced similar success and difficulties.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that “all the lifespans of his life” had fallen.
"If you had asked me last year, everything was about winning a gold prize," he said.
“You know what, there are more important things than the gold medal at the Olympics.
Robbie is my Olympic award.”
His son is baptized in the head of Robert, his father who died in 2011, mysteriously never after having diagnosed with cancer in the brain.
Daley said his father would not accept that he would die and one of the last thing he had asked about was whether they had been getting their tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front line,” he said.
“I kept his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until his breath stopped, and he was told that I finally admitted he wasn’t intimidating,” he said.
The next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that I had dreamed of this all my life, to dream in front of the audience at the Olympics. It doesn’t feel a better feeling,” he said.
It was also inspired by the choice of the first team - Proud by Heather Small - who had provided him with inspiration for the Olympics and gave him still a goose coat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 pm.
Mickelson in bad shape and dead sitting on the bench in Ryder's bike on Saturday
American actor Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Sunday, he is playing his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to find his old pace so that the record is not surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who plays in the race in the 12th time, was killed sitting on the bench after the decision of Jim Furyk for the competition in the fourth and fourth games on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the hater, as he has been so many times before the United States, the day is divided by the five-fold champions between being a clairvoyant and practicing the playoffs in hopes of correcting what he am.
Mickelson, 48-year-old, was never the best player for Le Golf National Golf Course, where wanting to be punished often for bad shots.
And not enough that the golf course is a major challenge in itself, but Mickelson needs to compete against Frances Molinari, the British Open, in the ninth game on Sunday. Molinari has a new Tommy Fleetwood team and together they have won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points below, they are taking the first game of 12 teams, getting a good start, could play Mickelson's changed purchases.
He said that he had no confidence in his husband, but he could hardly say much else.
"He completely understood the role he had today, clinched me on the back and took me outside and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is in the famous palace, and he has been such a big fan for the past and this week.
I probably didn’t expect him to play two games.
I saw more for myself, but it ended up and we knew we were going this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Fallo in a number of playing games in Ryder's Cup on Sunday.
This could market the end of a process in Ryder’s cup that has never reached just as high as any other record on his file.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 laps and 7 equals, but Furyk said that his presence would have a certain adverse effect on the team.
“He’s funny, he’s the coldest, the trick, enjoys making fun of people and it’s great to have him in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players liked to fight him too this week, and it was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just the golf game.”
Thomas Bjorn, the leader of Europe knows that a lot of things can go away quickly
European leader Thomas Bjorn knows it from the experience that good luck for the last day of the individual race in Ryder’s cup can easily change in uncomfortable experience.
The Dan played first in the game in Valderrama in 1997, with the side of the division's Second Ballesteros having five points ahead of the Americans, but managed to defeat the victory at the end with the least possible score, with 141⁄2-131⁄2 win.
“We’ve been in great shape in Valderrama, we had a lot of progress in Brookline, where we lost and in Valderrama, where we escaped, but just as so,” said Bjorn, who is seen here in a picture, after watching the 2018 season win 5-3 on Friday and Saturday and reach the National Park.
The story will show me and everyone in the team that it hasn’t been done.
We all go forward tomorrow.
Let's go and do everything right.
This is not done until all levels are on the table.
We have our goal and we are trying to win this cup, we focus on it.
I have always said this, I focus on the players 12 in our team, but we are very aware of our masters in the other team - the best golfers in the world."
Bjorn was very happy with how his players had behaved in a difficult way and added: “I’m never going to do it myself.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow is the result of the person who matters, and that’s another thing.
It’s great to play with a companion when everything goes well, but when you play one, you’re trying on every man’s talent as a golfer.
It’s the message that needs to be sent to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now a man understands his team and he also needs to play his best game himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his fellow Jim Furyk, will seek that his players stand better in individual games than with members, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points of four.
Furyk has experienced both sides on this big exchange on the last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brookline, but ended up losing when Europe implemented the “power plant in Medinah.”
"I remember every fucking word," he said, looking forward to how Ben Crenshaw, the team in 1999, would have gone on to his players for the last day.
“We need to play 12 important games tomorrow, but a man wants to start fast as happened in Brookline and Medinah.
When it progresses to build up, it causes a high pressure on the game that is in the middle.
We ordered our players according to it and let them play as we think it will be best tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defense and play against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the second European players in the first half of the game.
“I chose these players in this series because I think they’re all going through,” Bjorn said about his choice at the players in the individual contest.
Germany's new army has been delayed again.
The most recent German army commanders had to be built in 2014 to arrive in place of old military ships from the Cold War period, but it will not be ready until the first year of the year due to the car crash and risky cost, according to news in the area.
The building on the Rhineland-Pfalz, the leader of the brand new ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg party, has now been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to the sources of the military spokesman who spoke to Die Zeit magazine.
The ship had to be in the benefit of the Navy in 2014, but a serious problem after the delivery of the project.
The ship's four of Baden-Wuerttemberg's troops ordered in 2007 to arrive instead of the warships of Bremen, which have come to its end.
They should be equipped with a more powerful parachute, many air vents and ship warning cables and fault technology, such as reduced radar infrared, and sound signals.
Other important features are longer use time - it should be possible to use the latest ships for up to two years from their home ports.
However, it translates stable steps that this warship of the latest type - which are ordered to enable Germany to show its strength at sea - will be when it is finally taken into the benefit, says Die Zeit.
The F125 army came into the news last year when the German army officially refused to accept the fley and returned to Blohm & Voss drop in Hamburg.
This was the first time the ship returned to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the divorce, but German media spoke of a large number of women seriously —all in software and machinery" which made the warship useless if it was late in the military.
Galleries in the software were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg party will be controlled by 120 people, half less than on the armies of the Bremen party.
It also revealed that the ship was too heavy, reducing its performance and restricting the ability of the seaman to make adjustments to it in the future.
The 7,000 tons of ships “Rheinland-Pfalz” are considered to be twice heavier than ships in similar groups used by the Germans during World War II.
Outside the engine equipment, the cost of the entire project - including training the industry - is starting to cause problems.
It is said that he had reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), but originally had to be 2.2 billion euros.
The problem of the latest ships is particularly important in the light of the warning that the events of the Germans on the outskirts of the river have been reduced.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the commander of the defense committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the seaman was actually becoming a “super body with a working ship.”
The president said that the problem had escaped over time, because older ships were taken out of use but no ships came into their place.
He did not have any orders of the Baden-Wuerttemberg party could be used by the seamen.
The National Trust Association of Natural Health Organizations
A new study, which takes place in a rural area in the Scottish highlands, aims to find out how the leopards use the landscape when feeding for food.
It is expected that the results shed a new light on the behavior of such flying reptiles and help guide conservation operations in the future.
The study, which scientists at the National Trust for Scotland’s National Trust for Scotland, will monitor various types of leather bulbs in Inverwe do in Westerwe’s Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be set up in key areas of the area to monitor the behaviour of the lesions over the period.
Employees of NHS and volunteers will also carry out inspections with handheld sensors.
Experts will sound all recordings to get to the frequency of the calls, which the leather bulbs give off, and what types of do whatever.
Map of the area and the report will then be published to create a detailed image of their behaviour on a geographical scale.
Rob Dewar, a close-up supervisor for NTS, hopes that the results lead in light of any type of habitat are important for the leather buds and how they are used by each type.
This information will help determine the advantages of management of habitats, e.g. by creating meadows and how best to maintain woodlands for leather bulbs and other related species.
The leaves have been frozen in the last century in Scotland and all over the UK.
They are at risk of building and development projects affecting their nests and reducing their habitats.
Wind pain and light can also cause risks, also fly paper and certain chemical treatments on construction materials, such as and attacks from domestic meats.
The leaves are not blind.
However, their ears will be better off than their eyes when it comes to hunting soon, because they are used to fishing at night.
They used advanced rock technology to find insects and objects that are on their flight.
NTS, responsible for maintaining over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 77,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the leather bulb very seriously.
In the organizations, ten experts work, performing regular inspections, questioning and sometimes rescue operations.
The conflict has even come to the foot of the first and only European settlers of Scotland with the Three Gardens of Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten leopard species of Scotland have their own homes.
David Thompson, the overseer of the village, says he is a perfect place for them.
"The area here at Threeave is great for leather buds," he said.
“We have old buildings, plenty of grow trees and lots of good living areas.
But there is still a lot of unknowingly about leather bulbs, so the work we work here and in other places will help us understand better what they need to clean up.”
He stressed the importance of checking with leather bulbs before maintenance takes place in residential areas, where possible indemnification at one crash can kill up to 400 female bulbs and young people and make all bulbs in the area.
Leather bulbs are protected and it is forbidden to kill them, stress or interfere, or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative at the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, “We still have a lot of unheard of leather bulbs and we don’t know how well many of them go.”
Ronaldo denial attempts to rape are lawyers preparing legal proceedings against German magazines
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations against him about rape “fair news” and says that people want to “excite their attention” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to direct the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The project for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rapeing an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is said to have paid her 375,000 dollars after the incident, according to the news Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33, said in Instagram Live video with 142 million followers that they were “fair news.”
No, no, no, no.
“What’s said today is fake news,” said the world’s 5th floorer.
“These people want to focus on themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
It’s going to be famous by using my name, but it’s part of the job.
“I’m a happy man and everything is good,” the player added smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are under the responsibility of law enforcement Der Spiegel because of the allegations they have called “uninvisible publication of suspicions of private life,” according to Reuters news agency.
Christian Schertz said that Ronaldo would require a supplement for “the amount of the same amount and severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal data in recent years.”
The alleged incident has occurred in June 2009 at the Palms hotel and casino in Las Vegas.
After his visit to the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the room of the player, where he was forced to rape her in the end, according to documents filed for the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo had fallen on a knee after a failed incident and told her that he was “99 percent a good man” who had fallen into temptation because of the “1 percent.”
Ronaldo has agreed that the couple has had sex, but that it has consented to both.
Mayorga argues that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries to the hospital, but finally agreed to her acceptance without the courtroom because she was “daunted of revenge” and worried about becoming “stupidly public.”
She says she wants to stop her sweets because she is still in the aftermath of the incident.
Ronaldo was close to going to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape took place, and this summer he went to the Italian rice Juve with 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain would “see forever” to lose car manufacturers
Britain would “see it forever” if it lost its position as an international leader among the automotive manufacturers after Brexit, Greg Clark said.
He added that it would be “a concern” that Toyota UK would have told the BBC that if the UK would withdraw from the EU without a contract, the company would cease its production factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of the debris on the border if Brexit without a contract would cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota Auris and Avenis vehicles, produced almost 150,000 cars in the past, of which 90% were transferred to other European countries.
“My opinion is that if the UK is extinguished from the EU at the end of March, we will see production stations in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, chief executive of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have shown concern over the exit of the EU without the approval of how inter-country trade should be carried out, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is that what car manufacturers say to be the target chain risk if Brexit without a contract must be real.
Toyota’s production line is based on reception at the “last moment”, where parts are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars produced after ordering.
If the UK withdraws from the EU without a contract on 29 March, it may be a problem with the border that the European Union considers to be able to take and cut into account.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day in its factory in Derbyshire, said the company, and so production would stop.
Mr Clark said Chequers plan Theresu May for the future relationship with the EU’s “specially aimed at preventing these views on the border.”
“We need to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that allows us to enjoy not only success in modern times, but as an opportunity we can enjoy,” he told BBC Radio 4.
“The design data, not just from Toyota, but other manufacturers, also show that we must be able to continue with the most effective destinations.
Toyota could not say how long their output would be stopped, but warned that for a longer period of time, an increased cost would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and cost the final job.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a religious worker of the company at the factory, said his employees were increasingly concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs disappear, they will never return.
The government spokesperson said: “We have made a detailed and comprehensive plan for our future relations with the EU.”
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
The White House said on Sunday that the important meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein, the State Attorney General, could be "replaced again in a week" now is the basis for Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court, continues.
Rosenstein has oversees Roberts Muellers, a special prosecutor who investigates Russian conflict in elections, links between the supporters of Trump and Russia, and possible obstacles to the progress of the presidential right.
For many weeks, history reports have taken place in Washington about whether Trump will run an aid lawsuit, and with the establishment of Mueller's independence, Muellers has been in danger.
Earlier this month, the New York Times said Rosenstein had been talking about taking a recording call to address Trump and the possibility of electing the president from the latter by using the 25th additional board of directors.
Rosenstein denied this statement.
But last Monday, he visited the White House, including news that he was going to resign.
Instead, the meeting was announced with Trump on Thursday, but he was then at the United Nations in New York City.
Trump said: “I don’t want to run Rosenstein, but after that the meeting was postponed to the fact that he was not at the same time as the hearings of the House of Representatives, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who has committed sexual harassment, witnessed both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump announced a week-long investigation into the FBI’s investigations against Kavanaugh, who delayed the Senate’s vote.
Sarah Sander, a media representative of Trump, was broadcast on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked out at the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It has not been decided a date for him, it could be this week. I think it is possible that he will be postponed for another week because of anything else that is going on at the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and it’s always a pleasure to inform the media.”
Some journalists disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked about it.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not because of the unfavorable fact that television reporters were with “visitability,” but she said, “I am not in agreement with the fact that they are with virtuality.”
She then gave evidence that direct links between Trump and the media would be increased.
“The president answers more questions to the media than any other president has done before,” she said, without referring to the sources: “We have gone over these numbers.”
“The media will still go ahead,” Sanders said, “if the media have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it’s much better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do a lot of it and you’ve seen us do a lot of the last few weeks and it’ll come to a local media meeting when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or media meetings with other leaders visiting him.
The media with him is rare.
The president showed if there was a reason in New York this week, when he showed up in secret and at times strange behavior in front of a group of journalists.
The Minister of Health writes EU staff in Scotland for the sake of Brexit
The Minister of Health has written staff from the EU working within the health care system in Scotland (NHS Scotland) to describe the gratitude of the nation and wish it to continue working after Brexit has passed.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months until the UK is out of the EU.
The Scottish Government has already promised to meet costs for EU staff working within the public service sector.
Frk. Freeman wrote in his letter: “For the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU have been held because the statements continue and are expected to be decided in the autumn.
The British Government has also been working on preparations if it is not possible to negotiate.
I know it must be a great time for all of you.
That’s why I’ll take it back to how much I appreciate the work of all the staff, no matter what their nationality is.
Partners from the EU and across the EU come with valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves healthcare and benefits for patients and communities with whom we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we want a lot of you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie has been under emergency surgery after receiving a headache
Christion Abercrombie, a lineman for Tennessee State Tigers, had to undergo emergency surgery after receiving a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores team on Saturday, according to Mike Organ, Tennessee magazine.
Rod Reed, a Tennessee State chief, told reporters that the attack had been a shame for half.
“He came to the sideline and fell down there,” Reed said.
Coaches and nurses gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before being placed on the stock and drilled out for a more detailed inspection.
A statement from Tennessee State said Chris Harris, a WSMV radio broadcaster in Nashville, Tennessee, said that Abercrombie had been surgery at the hospital in Vanderbilt.
Harris added that there were “some information about the type or severity of the impact” and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the accident took place.
Abercrombie, who is in the final year of school, plays his first season with Tennessee State after flying from Illinois.
He had five businesses on Saturday before he left, which raised the total number of companies with him up to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged on higher stamps when they buy real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp charges when they buy real estate in the UK. The acquisition will be used to assist homeless people, according to the new plan of the Insurance Group.
The operation will make no success campaign of Corbyns to attract young voters
Lower stamp charges will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The government plans to deliver 120 million pounds a year - to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be charged on higher stamp charges when they buy real estate in the UK. The acquisition will be used to assist homeless. Theresa May will report this today.
The operation will have a reliable attempt to make no success campaign Jeremy Corbyn to attract young voters by promising housing for affordable prices and taxing high-tech customers rather.
Individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK must pay higher stamp fees, and the cash will go into the government’s operations to help homeless people.
The increase - which is additional to the current stamp debt, including the increase that was imposed on two years in extra homes and real estate for rent - could be up to three percent.
Government estimates that the increase will increase up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new buildings in London are purchased by foreign companies, but it causes price increases and makes those who want to buy real estate for the first time harder to get into the market.
Many economic areas in the country - especially in the capital - have become the "drugue town" because of the number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new trend comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp charges to help more young people get their first home.
He accused a large construction company of holding a fixed price high by buying land, but did not use them, and urged May to stop the markets in the world at affordable prices to create “houses” the UK.
Mr Corbyn has announced a number of significant improvements to housing policy, including rent supervision and the end of the out-of-the-counter leases.
He also wants more power to build a new home.
Theresa May said: “In the past I said that I would dedicate myself to the restoration of the British dream in my first period — that every new generation should enjoy better quality of life.
And it involves creating our unreal property.
Animals of the UK will always open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it may not be right that it is as easy for foreign parties and companies with headquarters in the country to buy a home and for reputable British landowners.
For many, the dream of their own home is becoming too distant, and the small thing that comes with homelessness is still too real.”
Jack Ross: “My main goal is to train Scotland.”
Jack Ross, coach Sunderland, says that it is his “pretentious goal” to become a coach of Scotland at some point.
This 42-year-old Shoko now enjoys the challenge of blowing a new life in the North-East club that currently sits in third place in the first division, three points from the top.
He moved to Sunderland this summer after arriving at St. Mirren again in the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my nation as a player.
“I was injured at the knee and there it was finished,” Ross told Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching Scotland often in Hampden with my father, as a child, and it’s always something that has taken me back.
But this opportunity would only be the case if I went well to coach the team.”
Former Ross as coach Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former coach Alloa Athletic Club said there was no fear of following such famous names in such a large club, but he had previously denied coaching positions at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“I’m going to recommend my success by thinking, ‘I’m going back to this club?’
“This club at a two-legged home because of its structure and facilities,” he said.
“It’s not easy to get him there, but I’d probably just look at me as a successful one here if I come back to the club.”
Ross has only three years of experience, as a coach, after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of the training course for Hearts.
He helped Alloa to recover from falling into the third division, and changed St Mirren, who was involved in the fall of the division, in the division champions the next season after.
Ross claims to be an independent now, but he was ever in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real time,” he said during the season when he became a coach.
“I really believed that the coaching team was getting me, even more than playing.
It sounds strange, because I went well, I had a decent income of it, and a much more pleasant success.
Changes can be difficult.
You have to walk through a lot every week.
I still go through it in terms of stress and pressure from my job, but the coaching job seems just right for me.
I always wanted to train and now I do, I’ve never been better with myself in all my adult years.”

The best time for beer is at 5:30 a.m. on Saturdays, according to the survey
This summer’s heat supply has been a challenge for the British bar that has a base, but increased pressure on restaurants chains.
Sales at the pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July, but sales at restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, from CGA’s business consulting company, said: “Performing sunshine and unexpected success in England in the world’s bible meant that July followed similar patterns and June months, when barsala increased by 2.8 percent, except what restaurants sold even less.
The sale fell by 1.8 percent at restaurants in June and went back in July.
Pöbbs and bars, which primarily catered for drinks, stood long with a greater impact while restaurants went down.
Pubs that sold food also had difficulty in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out to drink.
The sale of drinks in the pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, but food consumption decreased by about three per cent."
Paul Newman, from RSM’s research firm, said: “These results are continuing on the welding we’ve seen since late April.
The weather and impact of important social events or sports events are still the biggest factors when it comes to selling in markets outside of the home.
It is not surprising that restaurants still have difficulty, though, so that sales decreased by 4.8 per cent over a month is particularly painful on the continued pressure of caused costs.
This long and hot summer could hardly come in a worse time for food store and only the time will lead to the light of whether the tempt temperature, as we have had in August, will improve the situation."
The total growth in sales at pubs and restaurants, including newly opened places, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting how to open up.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the control company with sales in the British bar and restaurant store, collects and records data from 47 recruiters, with a total of up to 9 billion pounds and is the industry centre for the dealer.
One in five children has a secret account on social media that they hide for their parents.
One in five children, up to 11 years old, have secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents and teens, according to the results of the survey.
The survey that reached 20,000 students showed an increase in “gervi Insta” pages
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is published
Twenty percent of students say they have a “digital” account they show parents
One in five children, up to 11 years old, create secret accounts on social media that they keep secret to adults.
The survey design that reached 20,000 students showed a huge increase in "gervi Insta" accounts - which is a reference to the Instagram website.
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is published.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean “additional” account to show parents, as well as to have a secret account.
One mother, who fell down on a secret website 13-year-old’s daughter, found a teenager who encouraged others to “let me down.”
The study, which was conducted by Digital Awareness UK and a member of the private university (HMC), showed that 40 percent of children aged 11-18 had two accounts and half of them recognized to be with secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: “It’s a concern that so many young people are trying to create an area online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "red athlete" of the Scottish Athletics Sports Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been a member of the Scottish Athletics Committee as a member of the General Assembly.
Doyle is one of Scotland’s most successful free athletes, and Ian Beattie, the chairman of the committee, said that the nomination was a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her great experience in the international field over the past decade.
“Alidhi enjoyed great respect in the sports community of Scotland, the UK and international, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would be a great thing to get her to the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am very interested in speaking for the hand of athletes and hoping that I can put my middle of darkness and help lead the sport forward in Scotland.”
The U.S., which won among the 200 metres and 400 metres race at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, but a total of four Olympic golds, and now a regular guest at the BBC, was paralyzed after receiving a short-lived blood-heaviest.
He wrote on Twitter: “A few months ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would show me how much I felt and how much.
It’s been hard work, but I’ve been learning to walk and do sports today!
Thank you for your motivation!”
Blast pumping, which deals with cows, results in online analysis
A company that manufactures breast pump is now being reviewed online due to ads that produce milky breast milk products.
The company Elvie published a new advertising advertisement to mark the promotion of what is said to be “the first sound-plated breast pump in the world that can be carried outside.” The advertisement is inspired by music videos and to show the freedom that the new pump provides to mothers who are breast-feeding.
Four real mothers danced in the cave full of hearing and we talked with lyrics like, “Yes, I’m milking myself, but you don’t see me,” and “If you didn’t do it, it’s not a chicken but a chest on me.”
"Please, pump, pump, I close the kids, pump, pump, pump, I pump milk from the rolls."
However, the advertisement, which appears on the Facebook page of the company, has led to an announcement online.
The video has 77.000 views and hundreds of comments, and has received a dissimilar reaction from viewers, who say many say she’s gantrated with the “hurling” that comes with the milk.
“It’s a bad decision to use cookies to advertise this product.
Just like we do, they need to become a calf and carry to produce milk, except what the calves are being trained from them only a few days after they are born," he said.

Other audiences wrote: “It’s hard for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breast pump for mothers who can keep their children?”
Another added: “This advertisement is totally out of pace with time.”
Others came up with the advertisement to warn and a woman admitted that her song was “the beginning.”
“I think it’s a big idea.
I would have bought this if I had a baby on my chest.
I felt like a cow when I was pumping milk out of me.
It's a little clicky, but I took her as she is.
“It’s a genius,” wrote one of the viewers.
Others said: “It’s a fun advertisement that’s directly to mothers who pump milk (often at work or inside a toilet) and feel like ‘cushion’.”
It’s not an advertisement that scares or condemns the milk.”
At the end of the advertisement, the women’s group shows that they were all dancing with the breast pumps fall into their breasts.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women say that they lie like bubbles when they pump milk from their own.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely soundy, has no wire or cord and fits comfortably above the breasts, giving women the freedom to move, keep their child and go even while pumping.
Ana Balarin, the owner and head of Mother, said: “Elvie the pump is so revolutionary to be that it deserved a prominent presentation that would appeal.
By comparing women to cats with the direct spotlight to breast pumping and all her challenges, and showing even the fun and familiar way of the great freedom sensation of the new pump would provide.
This is not the first time that Elvie pump has come to the news.
On the fashion scene in London, two children came up with fashion shows for the designer Mötu Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved quietly into tentacles with border Texas
The number of immigrants in detention has suddenly increased even though the number of those who cross the border monthly has been held any way the same. The part of the reason is that hard words and policies that the government of Trump has seen have made it harder to bring the children to a temporary abortion.
In general, the foster parents have been unregistered by themselves, and fear to put their chances to remain in the country at risk, by offering themselves to foster children.
The risk increased in June, when the public authorities announced that potential foster parents and other adulthoods within the home would have to submit fines, and that the data would be shared with the immigrant control.
In the last week, Matthew Albence, the leader of the immigrant and customs supervision, testified before the elders and said that his organization had arrested a number of people who sought to foster single children.
The firm later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not on the trial.
“Nearly 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or inside a home that fosters children are illegal in the country, and their great part are illegal immigrants to the case.
“We continue to look for their individuals,” Mr Albence said.
In an attempt to speed up the affairs of the children, representatives of new rules that require some of the children to appear in court within a month from being placed in custody, rather than after 60 days, which were the previous criteria, according to staff working in the event of an incident.
Many of them will come through video meetings, rather than in their own personals, to draw smoke for their legal position before the judges in the domestic affairs.
The children who are sentenced to entry into the country are dispatched from the country.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to be anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent or complex attempts, according to the workers of the districts and reports that the system has published in recent months.
The officials said that these problems were even more likely in a larger organization, such as in Tornillo, where it is likely that no one will notice even though children are not difficult, because of how many of them are.
They added that the transport of children in the campground without providing enough time to prepare the spiritual or farewell friends could increase the impact that many of them already struggle.
Syria says "the warship" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw when instead
Walid al-Moualem, Foreign Minister, also said in his speech at the General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even if the war in the country is now in their eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays a role as Prime Minister, said that foreign troops were illegal in Syria, under the false assumption that they were fighting against terrorism, and that “it will be treated in accordance with that.”
“They have to go back immediately and without any divorce,” he said.
Moualem held that “the war against terrorism was almost completed” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions had to flee their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to “see this sacred struggle until we clean all the Syrian territories — of both terrorist groups and “all illegal foreign parties.”
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, with most of them training and advising both the Cuban and Syrian forces fighting the Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war-free country.
What matters to refugees, Moualem said that circumstances were good enough for them to return, and he taught “the Western countries” about “burning out the causeless fear” of refugees to stay away.
“We have called for an international community and a humanitarian organization to facilitate their return,” he said.
“They create control from something that should be exclusive to human dignity.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funding for rebuilding in Syria unless a political agreement lies between Assad and the United States to end the war.
Erindrek S. says that a new agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a neutral region in the last major fortress of the anti-Spyrian had created the opportunity to continue political relations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a huge attack by the Syrian forces strengthened by Russia, in the region where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had “fully closed” and described the hope that military operations would be directed to Jíhadís, including the fighters from the Nusa Front, who are connected with Al-Qaeda, and that they “replaced.”
The Staff of Mistura, Ambassador SÞ, hopes to be able to come up with the first meeting of a new committee consisting of the members of the government and the anti-slavery, to negotiate the Constitution for Syria after the war and to pay the street for elections.
Moualem presented conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, and said that her work should be restricted to "regarding the current government's powers," and warned all parties.
The reason Trump will win another election period
According to this argument, Mr Trump would win the 2020 re-elections, unless the prosecutor and the consumer bind the end of his presidential career, as many free speech viewers are likely to expect.
In what would be a doubtful “the dream of the end of the presidency ever!”
As a result, viewers do not have a feeling of fatigue.
Since 2014, viewers have seen at the best time more than doubled in 1.05 million by CNN, and nearly tripled by 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best time, rising from 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC, “The Rachel Maddow Show” has peaked at an audience of up to 3.5 million viewers on important news nights.
“This is a fire that people are told that, because this is something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, executive director of the ABC drama series “Designed Survivor” about the employee within the government who will be president after the House is destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell, the writer and author of the book, “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another feature.
She remembers taking a taxi in Boston for the elections in 2016.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he's coming to me to laugh,'" said Fr. Scovell to me.
It's a fun thing in the rest of the world.
However, unlike what is shown on the television, the stories from Washington could determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether family immigrants can be combined and the health of the global economy.
Only those viewers who enjoy what the most recent content has to stop watching.
And yet, this is more than being informed by a citizen when you look at the sixth time of a group of experts smoking the use of Bob Woodwards on “afar near” the sources of their book “Fear,” or $15,000 jackets from the string that Paul Manafort dressed (like the one fed with a straw, Daniel Post) and the consequences of the exact consequences.
I will never see Super Mario the same eyes again.
“Because of what he does, a demeanor feels like a reality, he gives a man something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the episodes “Pawn Stars,” he worked as a profession in the exhibition Trump’s and daily changes to the history of the N.J. Jong.

He could not get away, not when Brett Kavanaugh had to testify before the Senate and the future Supreme Court.
“I remember when we were creating all these clicked elements in old days and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’ Mr Floiss told me.

Money out of the darkest election of the Middle Ages
It is not surprising that the 17th Congress of Pennsylvania sees the money flow to it, thanks to the reorganization of the spheres that led to two representatives competing for the same set.
The newly elected Pittsburgh area sends a democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a second basement in a special election last summer.
Lamb stands against other representatives, the Republican Keith Rothfuss, who is now a representative of the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is heavily impacted by the new 17th district.
The map of the territory was redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old territory was organized in the interests of the Republicans and that it violates the Constitution.
The race at the new 17th election has been the beginning of a competition in the financing of the election campaign between the main fundraisers of both categories, the Democratic Committee (DCCC) and the Executive Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after naum win in special elections in March for the 18th district of Pennsylvania, but many followed with those elections.
Republicans had previously been in office for more than a decade and Donald Trump, President of the United States, won a victory in the campaign with 20 points will.
Scientists have given them a little bit of pressure.
The U.S. wanted to punish El Salvador because of China’s support, but then quit.
The Republicans decided that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with small media from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama in June 2017 and was staying at a hotel in Panama until the leaders of the Trump co-founder.
The U.S. Secretary of State decided to call back the U.S. ambassador to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “no more decision to admit the dispute no longer,” Heather Nauert said in a statement early this month.
However, penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received 140 million dollars from the United States for aid work in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The reference, which was applied to and included, among other things, the loss of financial support and restrictions on the release of residence permits, would have been painful for the Middle East, where much unemployment is high and the mortality rate is high.
After the establishment continued, U.S. and Central American representatives sought a conference on security and economic success and were to follow a similar agreement that was held earlier and thought to be a step forward in action to prevent people from moving to the United States.
However, in mid-September, representatives from the top ranks took it clear that they wanted the conference to come forward, and thus ended all the misdemeanors of punishment against El Salvador.
Mike Pence, Vice President of the Council, is now calling for the conference, which will take place in mid-October, which represents how important it is in the eyes of the government, said the remarks.
The U.S. ambassadors also turned silently back to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new hard message or punishment from Washington.
The White House spokesperson for Mr Bolton refused to discuss the discussions that the U.S. representatives described three, including two recollections, which agreed to discuss the interns against being unnamed.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external branch working closely with the government and also talked about the issue of namelessness.
Learn the story
The next issue could be a report by Roberts Mueller, a specialist prosecutor, of possible actions Mr. Trump to prevent justice, but for that reason there is a wide range of public evidence.
It is also said that Mr Mueller has turned his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's election campaign has won with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If the Senate is controlled by another party, Trump may have to be responsible for it, in the mouth of the person under his command to meet his electorate again, and if he wishes to subjugate his orders.
However, these are very unclear and I don’t want Trump’s case to be untrue, or even his colleague in Europe.
We all have to choose, both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, which will affect how long the struggle will be.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to rob Hitler, only if Western countries had provided him with the anti-terrorist and short Tékkólólimen in Munich.
We failed it and lost the opportunity to avoid the disaster that followed.
The story revolves around such important points and speeds or tricks for the unstoppable progress of the people.
Americans are faced with some of these important things now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump runs Rod Rosenstein government prosecutor, the man who decides the fate of research Mr. Muellers?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this magazine said that in the past he would have been able to make secret recordings of the president and talked about whether he was in office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the news from the Times is not correct.
“How will we respond if the new FBI at Brett Kavanaugh is not detailed or fair, or if he is confirmed to be a Supreme Court judge despite religious allegations of sexual harassment and unfavorable testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the middle term which will allow Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fell on these tests, the democracy will have to get tired of a long winter.
But I think we will not fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovak and was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government and sat before my ambassador.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to turn on the Sabbath crater on the table with the hamlet.
With such a legacy, how can I do anything but look at the positive eyes of our future?”

Graham Dorans, team Rangers, brighter for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers take on Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory against the Austrians will bring them in a strong position to get up from the G-group of the European Union. Rangers made an impressive tie in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month.
The winner of the knee prevented Graham Dorans from playing the first game of the season until the game against the Wild area that ended with a 2-2 equal score, but he believes Rangers can make a new appearance as a jumper for better performance.
"It was good to get this step for us, because Villarreal is a strong team," said Dorans, 31 years old.
“We started the game in the belief that we could achieve something and end up taking one step.
Maybe we could get a win at the end, but at the end of the day it was probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half and we got stronger in the second half and played better.
Thursday is another important evening for the European Union.
Hopefully we can reach three points, but it will be a tough game because they went well in their last game. But with the audience supporting us, I am sure we will triple this and get a positive outcome.
Last year was difficult, both because of the injury and the changes that occurred in the club itself, but now a good feeling in the place.
The team is good and the boys enjoy it, the training is good.
Hopefully we can go further now, put the last game time behind us and achieve success.”
Women lose sleep for fear of losing retirement
Although participants in the poll had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of themselves, they talked to their family members about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide survey said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term design.
Only 10 percent said this to their children.
“People want a family member to admit it, but it doesn’t take the right steps to have them co-operating,” said Holly Snyder, CEO of Nationwide.
That's how we start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot create your family under providing care if you do not make them your wishes with good warnings.
Talk to your counselor and your family about where and when you get care, because these options can change a lot of the cost.
Get your financial advisor in the matter: Your counselor can also help you find a way to pay for this cost.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term design are traditional life insurance with long-term design, mixed life insurance that pays out in cash, to help pay costs, or self-assure with your own money - as long as you have.
Prepare all legal documents: get rid of legal analysis in advance.
Get the responsibility of your health care provider so that you can assign someone you trust to manage your health care and ensure that your health care professionals are unable to tell them directly.
Also, consider getting a testimonial for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for your hand and make sure your accounts are paid if you can’t do it yourself.
Don’t forget the details: imagine that your elderly father or mother lives in an emergency and is on the way to a hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Please provide the information in a written schedule so that you are ready.
“It’s not just about finance, but also who the doctors are,” Martin said.
What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Be prepared for that plan.”

Prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for suspected terrorist attacker in New York City
The plaintiffs in New York want the death penalty over Sayyfullo Saipov, suspected of participating in a terrorist attack in New York City, which was eight people killed. This is a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for violating international law since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old, has taken Home Depot truck to attack people on bicycles along the West Side Highway street in the lower part of Manhattan. He doesn’t want to go down the walking and cycling roadways in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the plaintiffs must prove that Saipov has killed the victims of eight “injury” and cause serious bodily pains “injured,” according to the statement that the death penalty, which was filed in the New York Southern District.
Both of these charges can lead to possible death penalty, according to the court case.
A number of weeks after the attack, Saipov accused a 22-team federal prosecutor, including eight charges of murder in criminal purposes, who is usually used by prosecutors in prosecutions against organised crime organizations. Also, Saipov was accused of violent crimes and for destroying the bee.
The attack included “a relatively planned plan,” prosecutors said and described Sapiov’s work as “disturbed, cruel, and harmless.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov was elected as a body injury, injury and loss for families and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci,” the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been decades since New York’s last death sentence for treatment.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in a court case in New York in 1953, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the couples who were killed after being convicted of fighting for the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years ago.
Both were delivered in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no signs of repentance the days and months after the attack, according to court reports.
He told the investigators he was doing well with what he had done, the police said.
Saipov said he had received the idea that the attack after watching videos from ISIS in his phone, according to what the prosecutor said.
He also asked to show the ISIS prisoner in his hospital, said the police.
He has declared his innocence in all 22 sides of the prosecution.
David Patton, one of the public guardians of Saapovs, said that they were “invited disappointments” with the decision of the prosecutor.
“We believe that the decision to ask for death penalty instead of accepting a fine statement against life imprisonment without the possibility of experience resolution will only result in the outcome of this event for all parties,” said Patton.
The enemies of Saipov’s had previously asked the plaintiffs not to seek the death penalty.
The Board of Governors said NIGEL FARAGE should lead negotiations because of Brexit.
Nigel Farage promised to “react the people of the people” today at the conference.
This former leader of the Ukip said that politicians should “find for pressure” from EU officials, at the same time as one of the Senators Theresu May suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone told the Birmingham protests that the UK “very well out” now if Mr Farage was the leader of Brexit.
But the challenge that May faces in accepting a deep analysis of between her own team members came even better in light is supporters who want to continue in the EU, taking part in other protests against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep Chequer's plan on the right track and sits under criticism from those who are exposed to Brexit, those who disagree, and the EU.
The U.S. officials decided that she will continue to fight a deal with Brussels despite opposition - and to force those who are opposed to Brexit and the Workers' Party to choose between her plans and "no".
Mr Bone said to Leave Means Leave the protests in Solihull that he wanted to “lost with Chequer’s plan.”
He added that Mr Farage should have taken part in the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were with the government, we’d be out now,” he said.
Wellingborough said: “I will support Brexit, but we have to get rid of the Chequer’s plan.”
He explained his opposition to the EU and said: “We shouldn’t be in the world war to serve others.
We want to write our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone pointed out that public opinion had changed from the 2016 election: “The idea that the British people had changed their opinion and the will to remain quiet is absolutely unacceptable.”
Andrea Jenkyn, an enthusiastic supporter of Brexit, also told reporters: “I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequer's plan is hostile among the general public and the opposite will not vote with her. She enjoys the enemies among our classmates and the actions that are on the streets outside and chooses us.
Do it, stop the Chequers plan and start listening.”
In May’s direct message, she added: “The Prime Minister keeps the job when they stand by his promises.”
Mr Farage said that politicians would have to “find pressure” if they wanted to avoid the decision taken following the 2016 vote.
“It’s now about trust between us — our people — and our political party,” he said.
“They want to talk Brexit and we’re here today to say to them, ‘We won’t let you get up with this.’”
He added in his message to the crowd: “I want you to let your political party, which we are going to sink before Brexit, find pressure.
We are putting the general public in this country that gave us a victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we become independent, self-governing, proud Kingdom of Great Britain.”
At the same time, EU supporters held a protest in Birmingham, which ended with two hours of protest in the city centre.
A small group of activists hunted the captives against Brexit after the group was put on foot this weekend.
Adonis loan, from the Workers' Party, made a joke to officials for safety problems that came up in the phone app category when the conference was opened.
“This is the people who tell us that it can have all computer systems OK and all the technology for Canada plus, for borders without obstacles, for free trade with Ireland without borders,” he added.
“It’s an absolute hunky.
“There’s nothing to call good Brexit,” he said.
Warren is going to “think seriously” to go to the president’s office.
Elizabeth Warren, a U.S. Senator, said he was “thinking a serious blow to the president’s office” after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democratic Party has discussed its future at a civil conference in the western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has rarely criticised Donald Trump’s U.S. President, is offering a re-election in November against the Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired in Trump’s 2016 election campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been in the middle of the challenge that she could offer against Trump in 2020.
The meeting of Holyoke on Saturday was her 36th meeting in the form of mayors with residents in her constituency, since Trump took office.
One of the candidates at the meeting asked her if she wanted to go to the president.
Warren responded that it was time for “the woman to go to Washington and our government, and then a woman also needs a leader.”

The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that she had arrested one suspect in the case of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, but he was shot dead on Friday.
Baton Rouge's police announced a take-off at Dyteon Simpson, 20-year-old at a news conference at 11 a.m.
She had previously published a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was seen on the recording.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot to death near Southern University in early Friday.
“Wayde Sims got a shot in his head and died because of it,” said Murphy J. Paul, a police officer at the media on Saturday, according to news from 247sports.
Wayde came to defend his friends and was shot by Simpson.

The Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship title after Sebastian Vettel gives him the victory after the order of their team.
It was evident from Valtteri Bottas’ appearance in front of Lewis Hamilton at the start of Saturday, that orders from Mercedes would play a major part in the race.
Bottas got a good start in the start and left Hamilton almost after he left his position in the first two bends and offered Vettel to fight against his teammates.
Vettel first went into the pot and allowed Hamilton to drive into the traffic with the end of the group, but it should have been possible to assume the results.
The Mercedes car went into the pot for a second time and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton came out after a battle where the driver Ferrari was forced to leave behind the inside side after having been at risk of being left behind after a defense attempt in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started the team and was in seventh place at the end of the first round, on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the competition, he was tempted to switch the tires to try to finish quickly and get out of Kimi Raikkonen and reach fourth place.
He finally went to the dawn of 44th ring, but could not increase the speed of the eight rings left, and the Raikkon took fourth place.
It was a difficult day for Valtter to stand up for the weekend and was a true gentleman to let me go.
"The team has gone great to achieve this success," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad exercise.
Donald Trump, U.S. President of the United States, argued that Lieutenant General Diana Feinstein at the meeting on Saturday, due to her claim that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, with an appeal to Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court, on sexual harassment.
The president spoke at a meeting in Western Virginia, but did not directly discuss the testimony of Ford for the Senate Senate Senate ruling. Instead, he said that what was available in the Senate Congress showed that people were “bad and cruel and untruthful.”
“The only thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has been going on in the last days of the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are empty and cruel and untruthful,” he said.
“When you see the stories and the toys and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you smell this?
Do you remember her answer, did you read the document, “Oh, what?”
Oh, no.
“I don’t let it go.”
Wait a minute.
Let's go... no, we don't lend it," he said, and fought for the Senate senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where the allegations came from Ford against Kavanaugh, and it was leaked in early September. Feinstein denied that the play had come from her office.
“I didn’t blame Dr. Ford, I didn’t let her story,” Feinstein told The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it in faith and I did as she asked me.”
But her denial didn’t seem to go well into the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday: “I’ll tell you that, this was really a bad exercise.
Maybe she didn’t see anything, but it was the worst exercise I’ve ever seen.”
The president continued his defense for Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women, and claimed that the democracy was using the allegations.
“They are determined to regain power, no matter what method they have to apply.
You see the cruel, hopeful, they're the same every person they hurt, who they have to choose to succeed and control," the president said, according to the Mediaite news.

Air traffic operator makes life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on a plane escape earthquake
In Indonesia, a passenger carrier has been hailed as a hero after he left life to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers could take on air health and theft.
Over 800 people have left life and many are missing after a large earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and arrived at a local wave of waves.
A large number of earthquakes continue to shake the area and many are stuck under ruins in the city of Pala.
The 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, despite his co-operation with his colleagues having fled the government which was dissatisfaction with Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He was still in a position to ensure that the Batik Air aircraft number 6321, which was on the plane when the earthquake crashed over, could certainly be in the air.
He then jumped out of the control when he thought he was shaking.
He died later in a hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to news from ABC News in Australia.
We prepare helicopters from the Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
He died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're very sad to say this," he added.
The government fears that the number of dead people could go over a thousand, the country’s hemisphere says that access is limited to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The number of dead people is still rising because many bodies are still under ruins and cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the organization.
Up to six meters of high waves have caused immense destruction in Palu, but there will be a number of rains on Sunday.
The army and passenger aircraft work to bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, 35-year-old mother, said in an interview with Sky News: “In every minute, a ambulance comes with a body.
There is little water.
Small places have been everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the international Red Cross in Indonesia, said in an interview with CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is competing to find survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s already hard, but it could get worse.”

The airline, which had a plane flying down to a lion in Mexico, now says that one man is missing, after saying that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the search engine.
Air Niugini said in a statement that, as of the afternoon of Saturday, it did not know about the disappearance of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with the local authorities, hospitals and labs to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer any questions about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped save the other passengers and crew after the aircraft crashed into the water when she tried to land on the Chuuk island.
Police said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and that their condition would be stable.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and every exact series of events.
The U.S. Air Force and Marine Corps both said the aircraft had landed on the plane before the airport.
Some witnesses thought the plane had gone too far over the plane.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane had been very low.
“It was really good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others could wash the water and get emergency flights in the search engine.
He said the pilots had been scared and screaming and that he would have had a small head injury.
Sailor USA said that sailors, who were at a work dose from making up bridges, also helped rescue by using the bloating boat to ferry people to land before the aircraft sank about 30 meters deep water.

A specialist describes the timeline of the night as a woman was burned alive
The plaintiffs close their case on Saturday in a resumption case against a man who is accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert from the U.S. Department of Justice, was in the courtroom for many hours as a specialist in the field of information analysis.
He described it for the jury how he used a cell phone records to pulse the journey of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessicu Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from a number of mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, on the contrary, on his previous statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chamber at the same time as he said he had been with his friends, Michael Sanford, a police officer went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he had not been in town that day.
When prosecutors asked whether Tellis was saying true when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said it was "very, because my car was in Nashville."
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
The mobile phone shows that they only knew one week.
Rowlett said that sometime after the death of Chambers, Tellis had deleted text messages, phone calls and contacts from her phone.
“He destroyed her from his life,” Hale said.
The goal is to keep our clients moving their final talk on Sunday.
The judge said it would be possible to leave the case later that day.

Another black person?
In New York City, couples are filed for a criminal offence after a “fifty” text message.
In New York City, married couples are prosecuted because of an illegal crime after she received a surprise text message from her mother where she complained that she was “designing a black person.”
The couple refuses to be prejudiced and similar to the law of “extreme.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a two-year-old mother, said overly unhappy when she learned that her new cousin, Giselle Maurice, was black, she was able to work for the first time in 2016.
“NEEEIIIII ANNUMENT MANESKJA” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in text messages.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent them twice to Fr. Maurice.
After discovering his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fr. Maurice and said that his former cousin, who was a teenager, had been ill, and that she had expected to have a Filipino woman, according to New York Post.
Frk. Maurice was paid for one day of work and then sent home to Uber car.
Maurice now orders the couple and wants to pay for the crime, an amount of $350 a day for the six-month job she had been originally hired, though no deal has been signed.
"I wanted to show them that this should not be done," she said in an interview with Post on Friday and added, "I know this is a difference."
The couple have objected to the allegations that they are prejudiced and say that it was the right thing in the case of recruiting Maurice, because they felt they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her a message she didn’t want to say.
She's not prejudiced.
“We are not stupid people,” said Joel Plasco.
“But who would trust their children for someone after showing birth, even if they were surprised?
Is your newborn child born?
Don't do that."
Plasco looked like the law of “extreme,” and said that his wife was seven months on the way and was in “a difficult situation.”
“Do you want to attack someone in this situation?
"It's not very beautiful," said Plasco, who works in the investment company.
The case is still right, but the public has gone hard words about the couple on social media and shamed it for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington’s learned that readers should be hard to talk to a bear, says in a new letter.
Karen Jankel, daughter of Bonds who was born shortly after the book was approved, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put herself in a footprint of someone who reads it for the first time before she was released.
“It’s very funny now that we know of the great success of Paddington.”
She said that her father, who won the BBC before he got inspired to write a children's book about a small toy bear, had taken the rejection of his works with a calmly positive, and added that the sixteenth edition of the book would be "good" after his death in the past.
What Paddington relates to, as she describes as “the most important family member,” she added that her father had shown sound proud of his success in the end.
“He was a very quiet man, and he was not accustomed to being overturned,” she said.
“But since Paddington was so real for him, it was almost as when a man at a child who does something. A man is proud of it even if he did nothing himself in fact.
I think he’s looked at the success of Paddington’s.
Although Paddington was a creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington his own honor.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her through the phone.
When she had her daughter moved to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in her power to save her life, but without success.
“Now called regularly and told me that the situation was very bad, that it was not expected that she survived,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“The site called Nad to me and said she would die within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be soon with you.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep the heart beat up were gradually losing their activity and being separated from the body.
She had died a short time before, and this was the body to give up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing it was all happening.
I couldn’t cry or cry, because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to control myself.”
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now sewed her deceased daughter on board the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the difficulties she experienced.
“No one knew anything,” she said.
“I pulled my head and the tears fell all the time.
It’s hard to explain it, but during the flight I found too much sympathy with Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Syrian women hang up a message to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who had a loved one who committed suicide are now trying to prevent others from having no life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted a message on the bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and phone numbers that people can call in and get help.
Tyler, son of Davis, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide when he was 18 years old.
“I don’t want to feel like I have to feel everyday,” she said.
Frk. Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney and said her son had been a successful chef with infectious smiles.
“He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could describe any room.”
He stopped working before he died, because he was “sucking down into a very dark place.”
In 2014, his brother Tylers, aged 11, found his brother dead after taking his own life.
Mr. Davis said, “I’m still worried that it will be a success.”
Frk. Davis gave the message “to let people know that it is possible to go and talk to others, even wine.
Don’t sit and say nothing, you need to talk to someone.”
Fr. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Fr. Davies for years, lost Mark, his spouse to 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t talk about him being hurt or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“Some days after Christmas, we took a change in his injury.
He was up on his worst day of Christmas, when the children opened their gifts, he didn’t look in their eyes or anything.”
She said that his death would be a huge shock, but that they would have to get out of it: “This is going to ruin the family.
That's a little bit of us.
We have to fight and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh's gang on blues is the FBI's investigation
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for — a study with limited time and scope — we might have reached a little bit of agreement,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was “to be broken” in the middle of the mid-range analysis between the categories where everything was in the back.
Why would Mr Kavanaugh and his supporters from the Republican Party not want the FBI to investigate the matter?
The number of them is due to the timing.
The mid-term sessions are after only five weeks, the 6th of November. If the Republicans go badly, as expected, they seriously weaken their attempts to get their husband elected to sit in the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush has been calling the Senate senators to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who won for Mr. Bush in the White House and met Ashley, his wife through him, but she was a private critic, Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes his research report?
The meeting will be held at the Senate Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit like they are.
It is not yet possible that Mr Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, but it would make Mike Pence Vice President possible to break up the equal and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
The number of people fleeing North Korea "minds" under Kim's control
The number of people fleeing North Korea and going to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to the South Korean parliament.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted in data from South Korea’s South Korea Joint Committee, said 1127 people had fled earlier, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the string of border alerts between North Korea and China and higher charges were driven by smugglers with people being key elements.
Pyongyang has not released any official statement.
The vast majority of those fleeing North Korea are invited to receive South Korean citizenship rights.
Seoul says that over 30,000 people from North Korea have gone illegally across the border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee to China, but it has the longest border to cross North Korea, and it is easier to cross them but the well-rounded region between North and South Korea.
China looks at the refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return to their home country.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still in war, have improved over the past month.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that were mainly about suspended negotiations on nuclear weapons.
This was after a historic meeting in June between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work together towards a nuclear war against Korea.
On Saturday, Ri Yong Ho, the foreign minister of North Korea, taught American trade plans for cards in front of them.
“With confidence in the U.S., there is no certain security of our country and under such circumstances it is impossible that we take a single down our nuclear weapons first,” Ri said in a statement in a statement on the U.S. General Assembly in New York City.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "the mother's nurse" and says he is unfit to oppose the work of the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority at the parliament called Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court judge “the mother’s illness,” and said he too much to be able to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi allowed this word to fall into an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t do anything but think that if a woman had ever let her like that, she would have been called a mother’s nurse,” said Pelosi on his reaction to the testimony of Kavanaugh for the Senate’s office on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied a great sense of the excuse that he had been accused of murdering Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both young.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was a bit of a sense of emotion, and sometimes he ran close to it, and got a cake in his neck when he kidnapped his family and school years.
He also denounced the official democracy of the committee and called the allegations on his hands “unreal and organized genocide” that had been organized by liberals who were outraged by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that the testimony of Kavanaugh's true that he could not work at the Supreme Court, because he showed that he was biased against the demotions.
“I think these statements and how he attacked the Clintons and demaciously show that he’s in trouble with the job,” she said.
Pelosi did not respond when asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh fired from work if he is confirmed and if the Democrats reach the majority of the Senate.
“I’ll say this: if he’s not telling the Senate or the FBI the truth, he’s not only in a position to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the right he’s now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently working on a court of law in Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democracy, she was worried about the possible decisions of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion laws of Roe v. Wade, where he is said to be a resident judge.
We talked about Kavanaugh's questions as to whether he would make a certain decision on the Supreme Court.
“It’s no time for a mother’s disease, a neutral person to go to the Supreme Court, and expect us to say “It’s wonderful.”
And women need to use it.
This is the right word, months, and years of hot air flowing out, and it does not come out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, but you?”
She continued, “I got a great help from a woman who was the manager somewhere and said that she also cried when she was angry, but she had developed technology so that when she was angry and started crying, she said to her lawyer, “You may think I’m dying because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continued to cry.
And I thought it was a big joke.”
Tens of years are allowed to express anger in part because they are misconceptions in fundamentals.
One of my most clear memories of the previous job I received in the office with men in the majority, where I began to cry by a lift that I couldn't express, came an older woman and took into my knees. She was a cool boss I had always feared a bit and she pulled me into the ladder.
“Don’t let them see you cry,” she said to me.
They don't know you're the carpenter.
They think you are deaf and happy to have reached you.”
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart when he was in office, but she was then a Democrat from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested at the request of a boat named Monkey Business (Apaspor) and pulled his offer back, Mr. Schroeder, considered full horror, that there was no reason why she could not consider offering herself to the president.
“It wasn’t a good decision,” she laughed at me, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates and the last thing they needed to keep was one more.
“Someone gave this name “Mow White and the Devils seven.”
As far as the campaign was held, it was after what became an investment, so it was named to not offer up unless it was able to collect 2 million dollars.
It was a lost fight.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“Do you think I can get a discount?” she asked.
When she moved her speech and announced that she would not be in a formal fashion, she was so overwhelmed by feelings - thankful to the people who had briefed her, grievances against the system, which made it so difficult to raise money and direct her sights to vote in place of representatives, and anger into the sense difference - to make her feel good in crying.
"I could think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said.
“I think Kleenex was my strength.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my leg?
“She cried?”
The reason that trade war between the United States and China could be good for Beijing
The first shot in the trade war between the United States and China was honest, and although the war is far from over, the gap between the countries could be advantageous for Beijing to a long time, experts say.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, cut the first anti-dumping duty earlier this year by taxing China’s main export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week’s most significant milestone came with new customs that reach over products to shed 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), and tax as much as half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Peking has responded to the same coin each time and recently added 5 to 10 percent of US goods to a total of 60 billion dollars.
China has been called to respond to the U.S. customs bill, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy will leave the world soon.
In order to get Washington to cut off demands, but it was all too derogatory for Xi Jinping, President China to turn himself public from the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing is right on the games, pressure from the trade war with the United States could have a positive impact on China for a longer time, by reducing the beneficial need for both.
“The fact that fast political decision either in Washington or Beijing could lead to the reasons leading to economic crisis in another country, is actually more dangerous than the viewers have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a research researcher focusing mainly on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria’s “prepared” under the return of refugees,” the Foreign Minister said.
Syria claims to be ready for refugees to return to the country and seek help to rebuild the country, which is now in a bad situation after seven years of war.
Walid al Moualem, Foreign Minister spoke at the United Nations General Assembly and said that the situation in the country has improved.
“Today, the situation on earth is below stable and safer, thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to come into normal situations by building up a region that was destroyed by terrorists.
All is now ready for refugees to return to the country they were forced to leave because of the terrorist and unilateral economic decisions that target their day-to-day lives and jobs.
It is estimated that over 5.5 million Syrians fled the country from the start of the war in 2011.
Six million additional people still living in the country need help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian authorities would like to help rebuild the country.
On the other hand, he stressed that they would not accept aid dependent on conditions or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the U.S. team with a score of 16.5 against 10.5 points at Le Golf National tournaments outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six times in a row on European ground and has not won Ryder in Europe since 1993.
Europe reached its crown again when the team, led by Danish leader Thomas Bjorn, reached the 14.5 points it needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had difficulty most of the competition, cut his start in the water on the 16th hole, which is paired 3, and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was cut in all of his games and became one of 4 players to get the result 5-0-0, since the competition began using his current format in 1979.
Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 against Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, but he was second in the ranking of players in the European team.
Dustin Johnson, who is in the top spot on the list of the best golfers in the world, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who played possibly in his last race of the Ryder Cup.
Spain's Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times over the Ryder Cup, became the most successful European race with 25,5 ferry runs.
“I don’t cry, but today I can’t do anything else.
It has been a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas has chosen me and believed in me.
I am so happy to catch the cup again.
“It’s about the team, and it was my pleasure to help,” Garcia said after winning Europe.
He gave his land to John Rahm, but he won the title of Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
“I was incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him,” said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and is now registered with 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange result for one of the best players of history, who has won 14 major titles and is only in second place on Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had a hard time finding themselves on the pitch, outside Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a good game throughout the race.
The U.S. President Jim Furyk said, “I’m proud of them, they should be hurt.
It was at some point in the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him down.
I'll take over Thomas.
He's a great team.
All 12 players play very well.
We come back together, I will work with PGA in the United States and name Ryder the bishop and we will continue.
I love these 12 men and am proud to be their leader.
You have to take over.
They played better than we did.”
