Walisian MPs do not want to appear as “muppets”
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, known today under the abbreviation AM (Assembly Members), are not completely satisfied with the proposal that their title can be changed to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes as a result of the plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives from all over the political spectrum fear that this can lead to ridicule.
A representative of the Labour Workers' Party explained his group was worried because "it rhymes on Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means "dustete", and pwp means "beach".
A representative of the Wales Party Plaid Cymru said that the group was essentially "miscarried" and that they have proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh part of the Conservative Party said that his group was "open" for the change of names, but noted that the pronunciation of MWP is very close to the word "Muppet", as well as being the name of some famous dolls, is also a British slang word for "youst".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced in a similar way as the letter U is pronounced in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like a "uh" sound.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the change of names, said: “It is of course the members themselves who have the last right of provision when it comes to what name they are to be referred to.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly authorization to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public hearing showing general support for re-establishing the parliament of the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of representatives, the Commission supported WMPs (Welsh Parlaiment Members), but the MWP option received the most support during the public hearing.
The representatives are suggesting, apparently, other options, but having all parties come to an agreement can lead to headbreaks for President Elin Jones, who, according to the plan, will deliver a legislative draft for the change of names in the next few weeks.
The legislation on reform will include other changes to how the National Assembly works, including the rules for disqualification of representatives and the design of the Committee system.
Representatives have the last right to vote on what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians go to the elections to determine whether the country's name should be changed
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia may vote for the name of their country to be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is held in an attempt to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a requirement for their territory, and has, on several occasions, opposed the country’s applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
The referendum’s supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price they have to pay to participate in the EU and NATO.
Watches in St. Martin's Styles - The Critics of Harlem Wear
“The old ones I talked to have told me that before there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“Now there are none of the parts.”
He said the bar's apostasy was understandable.
“People interact with each other socially in other ways,” he said.
"Barer is no longer the meeting places of the local community, all of which visit regularly."
As for the churches, he fears that the money from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders believe. “And sooner or later they are back at the beginning.”
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by the apartment building full of the kind of people who will not help the remaining sanctuary of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and will therefore only speed up the day when these churches have to close the doors too well, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodistism moved out in the 1930s.
A black church that had been in the vicinity took over the building.
St. Martin's received a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of dealerships at 125th Street, one of Harlem's main contractors, because they failed to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 caused major damage to the building, and when father Johnson's parish children laid plans for rebuilding they bought a carillon.
Prest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, declared proud that the carillonet was "the church watches of the people".
The expert who played the Carillonet in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "a irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillonet in the world to be played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillonet at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's in the last couple of months is a complicated interaction between architects and contractors, some of which are guided by the church's legislature and others by the diocese.
The church council, consisting of legions, wrote to the diocese in July regarding its concern that the diocese came to "try to force the costs" of the church council, despite the fact that the church council had not been involved in the introduction of the architects or contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parish children complained of lack of transparency from the side of the diocese.
Hai injured thirteen-year-old on lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he appeared after lobster in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy yelling for help, and that he and a group of others swam over to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy called by enthusiasm to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy shouted, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
His entire collar bone was torn up," says Hammel, who discovered the damage when he reached the boy.
“I shouted that everyone had to get out of the water: ‘It’s a shark in the water!’” he added.
The boy was transported by air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was presented in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is not known.
Chief Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was established that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim suffered serious injuries in upper torso.
The authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to make its entry into the UK's beauty care market
Sainsbury's challenger Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with warehouse-like makeup and beauty care shelves, manned by specially trained employees.
The expanded shelves are tested in 11 shops around the country as part of a powerful entry into the UK’s 2.8 million beauty care market, which is constantly experiencing growth while selling the sales figures for clothing and home items fall. If the experiment turns out to be successful, the concept will be expanded to several stores next year.
The investment in beauty care is the result of the supermarket’s efforts to find a new use area for the space previously used for TVs, microwaves and home items.
Sainsbury's has said that they will double the number of beauty care products they offer to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the store chain has never sold before.
Existing product selections from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also get better space in branded brand areas, just like in stores like Boots.
The supermarket chain also relaunches its Boutique mins brand with mainly vegan products, because it is becoming increasingly demand for this among younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer The Fragrance Shop will test out sales tables in two Sainsbury's stores. One opened in Croydon in south London last week, while the other opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online trading and a new tendency to buy small quantities of food daily from local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's has said that sales will eventually look more and more like a commodity magazine, as the supermarket takes up the fight against the cheap stores Aldi and Lidl with several services and goods except food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of shops, and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets after buying both chains two years ago. According to them, this increased food sales and made purchases more profitable.
Supermarket’s previous attempt to upgrade the department for beauty care and drugstores was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration was discontinued after a quarrel about the distribution of the income from pharmacies in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 store pots to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a selection of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's trading director, said: "We have transformed the appearance and design of the beauty care shelves to create more welcoming surroundings for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who are so prepared to provide advice and help.
Our brand selection is designed to meet all the needs, and the inviting surroundings and practical placements make us now a beauty care competition that represents a new shopping experience.”
Peter Jones is “fast” after Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement worth GBP 11 million
Dragons' The star Peter Jones is said to be furious after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a 11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time for their home and accessory brand, Truly.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop.
Willoughby (37) who is a programmer in This Morning, announced on Instagram that she leaves the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' The star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle brand in the last second to focus on their own new gold edged contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "serious" at an open meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. It was here that the television gold girl admitted that her new agreements - which are worth up to GBP 1.5 million - means she no longer has time to be over to their clothing and accessories brand, Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand, Goop, and it was expected that it would double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of GBP 11 million.
Meanwhile, as Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she will leave Truly, Jones left the United Kingdom on his way to one of his vacation homes.
A source said: “Truly was undoubtedly Holly’s first priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her financial security in the next few decades.
Everyone is shocked that she has chosen to retire.
There was no one who could believe it when it happened last Tuesday - it was right before the launch.
Now a warehouse is fused with goods at the headquarters of Marlow, which is now ready for sale.”
Experts believe that this Morning programmer, which is among the UK’s most popular stars, can cost the company several million pounds due to large investment in products such as pillows and light, fashion and cosquires, as well as a potential delay in launch.
This can mean the end of a long friendship.
The three-child mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became chairman in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones has 40% ownership in Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby is to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin hosting the ITV program I'm A Celebrity.
A source of Jones said yesterday, “We don’t want to comment on his business affairs.”
Celebrities "and so in love with us"
He was aware of the criticism he would receive from the news media for making a comment individual will consider "little presidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give away so much?
Trump said in his aftermath of a news anchor.
"I haven't given anything away."
He remarked that Kim is interested in a new meeting, after even declaring that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a big shit on the road to nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a "similar response" from the United States on its early disarmament measures.
He remarked that the United States has continued sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure up.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for a congregation of his voters.
"We do very well with North Korea," he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Many millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his work to improve Kim's relationship has given positive results, such as putting an end to rocket tests, helping to get released hostages and getting the remains of U.S. officials sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about Kim's relationship.
"It's easy to act with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this stylized arena, we would have had around 200 people standing right here," Trump said.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia breed an island and kill hundreds of people
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, foreign nonprofit organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10% of Lombox residents had lost their homes, a national disaster was not declared as a requirement for international assistance to be submitted.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they don’t ask for international assistance, so it’s quite challenging,” Sumbung explained.
Rescued children are now putting together a team to travel to Palu, but are still not sure if foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the national emergency management agency, said Indonesian authorities are considering the situation in Palu to see if international organizations are to be allowed to contribute to the relief work.
Considering the earthquakes in Indonesia are constantly exposed to, the country is badly prepared to deal with the wrath of nature.
Ly to protect against tsunamis is built in Aceh, but they are not a common view along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a warning line on Palu, although a warning had been issued, has likely contributed to the death figures.
Even during the best circumstances, it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widododo made an upgrade to Indonesia's fallowed infrastructure to a major point in his campaign, and has spent a lot of money on the way and rail.
But the lack of money has been a major problem for Jokos administration, which is due to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have gone to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee their homes when Christians and Muslim gangs blew the streets with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge with late appearance in battle against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Premier League loss to Chelsea on Saturday by scoring in 89th minute in the game at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturdge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea goal while his team lay 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to his left foot before sending it to the longest corner.
The experiment went high above the box as the ball dalted to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally went over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I just tried to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq always send the ball forward as well as it allows me to do so, so I just tried to give myself as good time as possible,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kane come and affected the ball once and didn’t think too much about it and just fired it on.”
Chelsea led by 1-0 at the break, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker sent a pass with the heel back to Mateo Kovacic, before changing direction near the midfield and sprinting into the Liverpool orbit half.
Kovacic made a quick transfer on the midfield.
He then fired off a great breakthrough pass that led Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner met a left foot kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play against Naples in the group game of Champions League at 15.00 on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in the Europa League for men in London at 15.00 on Thursday.
Deaths from the tsunami in Indonesia reach 832
The deaths after Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami have risen to 832, the country’s agency for crisis management announced early on Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake with a 7.5 strike that struck the country on Friday and caused waves of up to six metres, quotes Sutopo Purwo Nugroho explained at a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380 000 inhabitants, was full of materials from racial buildings.
Police arrest man (32) for murder after a woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been initiated after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with stab wounds at 7:55 in Grayson Mews, John Street. A 32-year-old man is arrested, suspected of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard something about contacting.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: "We are at the very beginning of the investigation, but I want to ask everyone who was in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and then or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
We also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught up on something on their car camera, to contact - they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the deceased woman was a permanent resident of Birkenhead, and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have said they are working to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been told that no one is allowed to go in or out of the building.
He was a goalless man when he discovered what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will take several hours before they get back in.
A police officer was interrogated when he told a man that the whole area is now being treated as a scene.
A crying woman appeared on the scene.
She repeats "it's so terrible" over and over again.
At 14 p.m., two police cars were behind the roadblock, while a third car was just outside.
A number of police officers stood outside the roadblock and had an overview of the apartment complex.
People who have information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPollCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, by referring to "log 247" from September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last memorial drawn into the argument of "to rewrite history"
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures carried out by his fanatical Puritan supporters.
But the history team Comwell Society has described Jeremy Crick's publishing as "speakable" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, says: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside the Westminster Palace also came to be a goal.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the preceding century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s amazing production of Cromwell is a proof of the 19th century opinions and is part of his historiography of a man many still believe deserves to be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is becoming of many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, seen as Parliament’s defender against pressure from outside — in his time it was of course talking about the monarchy.
If this is an entirely accurate representation, the subject of historical debate remains.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating.”
Drapsgris kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, who is only mentioned by the surname "Yuan", was found dead and covered with blood from a torn pulsary near a binge on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to put vaccines on pigs on a farm on May 30, 2005 in the city of Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had reportedly travelled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the cousin found him dead, and discovered that the gate of a nearby pig horse was open.
He said that inside the swine fever it was a big mistake with blood on his mouth.
A forensic survey confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had killed the man.
"The legs of my cousin were bloody and painted" explained the cousin, referred to by the surname Wu, in a quote to Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings from surveillance cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The beast who killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
While police gathered evidence from the scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked inside to prevent the attack of someone else.
Yuan’s family and market management are apparently negotiating compensation for the death.
Although it happens the source is not the first time a pig has attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on a farm in Massachusetts, causing serious damage to the man.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pushed up against a tractor and attacked by a pig of 300 kg until the farmer's wife managed to chase away the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not aggressive to ordinary, but that the taste of blood may have an triggering effect.
"They're just playing.
They like to bite, and are very curious... they're not trying to harm anyone.
You just have to show sufficient respect.”
The rest of Hurricane Rosa will lead to heavy rain in the southwest United States
As reported, Hurricane Rosa is weakened as it moves across the cooler sea on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flood rain on his journey through northern Mexico and southwest U.S. in the next few days.
Rosa had a windsurfing of 135 km/h and was a hurricane of category 1 at 05:00 ET on Sunday, and found 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a tributary begins to be flooded across the Pacific Ocean and moves east to the west coast of the United States. In the case of Rosa approaching Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical humidity north to the southwest US.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm of precipitation in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the interaction between tropical humidity and the straw approaching will lead to widespread heavy rains in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous flooding, floating debris and rapid and possible landslides in the desert.
Dyptropic humidity will lead to precipitation rates of up to 5-7 cm per hour in some areas, particularly areas south of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5-10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the Southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
There are opportunities for flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered tropical rain.
It is very unwise to move around in the desert on foot as long as there is a danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause river valleys to become wide-blown rivers, and the thunder will lead to local wind gusts that can contain dust and sand.
The terrain approaching will lead to local heavy rain showers for parts of the coast along southern California.
Total rainfall over 1.3 cm is possible, and this can lead to liquid debris and fast, as well as smooth road paths.
This will be the first rainfall of the area during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and last all Wednesday.
October may cause some intense temperature fluctuations across the United States, as the Arctic is colder but the tropics remain very hot.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We will see a clear example of powerful temperature differences throughout the central U.S. on Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will attempt to build up and expand again.
Large parts of central and east U.S. will probably get a warm start in October, with degrees high in the twenty-first century from Southern Plains to parts of the north-east US.
New York City can reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday - this will be approximately 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates that east-USA will most likely have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people looked at Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers, distributed on six TV networks, saw Thursday’s arresting testimony from Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political feud continued, and broadcasters interrupted their regular broadcasts to announce Friday’s great surprise in the last second, when it came to the conclusion that the Senator of Arizona, Jeff Flake, had ordered it so that the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate court committee that she is 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh followed her and tried to take her clothes at a secondary school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he is 100 percent certain that this did not happen.
The broadcast on Friday was probably seen by more than 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average rankings for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number was not immediately available to other networks showing the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen is usually having trouble measuring office seats.
To give a little perspective, this series is equivalent to the playoffs of American football championships or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionverts have supported Kavanaugh's appointment with great enthusiasm, led an among the networks, with average ratings of 5,69 million for the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2,94 million, MSNBC had 2,89 million, and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still great after the hearing.
Flake was the main character for Friday's drama.
The moderate Republican's office made a statement that he came to vote in Kavanaugh's favor. Friday morning, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras trying to take the elevator to a meeting in the court election while protesters yelled and shouted at him.
He stood with lowered glances for several minutes while being exposed, at the same time as the incident was sent directly to CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said a woman.
“Do you think he tells our country the truth?”
He heard that “you have power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake pointed out that his office had made a statement, saying that the elevator doors closed that he would have more to say about the matter at the committee hearing.
The Cable and Broadcasting Networks covered all the hearings directly several hours later, when the court election would vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination would be continued to the entire Senate for voting.
But Flake said he was only willing to do this if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate next week, which the Democratic minority has called for.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flake's elections had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of "political games" around Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused the opponents of her plan to leave the EU to run "political games" with Britain's future and undermine the interests of the nation.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, sided with her own on the newspaper's front page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson has continued her attack on her so-called "Chequers" plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU would collect each other's tariffs was "helt ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police attack Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of causing LSU player death
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) is arrested and charged with murder, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities have released a video footage of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the Bavarian attack.
Police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS partner WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admits to shooting and killing Wayde.
His bail is set to USD 350,000, according to The Advocate.
The trial drug in East Baton Rouge Parish published a preliminary report on Friday, stating the cause of death as a gunshot wound in the head and through the neck.
Police thanked Louisiana Stat Police's working group for the capture of refugees, the state's police lab, the Southern University Police and the locals for contributions to the investigation that led to an attack.
LSU's athlete Joe Alleva thanks to the area's police force for his "hard work and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m high forward player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 return points per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "damaged" and "in shock" after Waydes' death.
“This is what we fear at all times,” Wade said.
Volcanoes ash over Mexico City
The ashes that splash out of the volcano Popocatepetl have reached the southernmost neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
Centro Nacional de Prevención de Desastres, Mexico’s public agency for crisis prevention, warned Mexico’s population on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after the activity rose in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within a day.
The agency monitored several cases of bulging and shaking.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of ash covering front routes on the cars in neighborhoods such as Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicians have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is 72 km southeast of the capital after an earthquake of 7.1 struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police in clashes with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protesters for independence had a clash with the police, while several thousand participated in competing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on release.
A group of masked separatists were held back by the riot police, bombarding them with eggs and powder paint, which caused dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
The gun also broke out later in the day, when police used batons to limit fighting.
For several hours, independence protesters stood and shouted, "Never forget, never forgive," face to face with union protesters shouting "Lingen live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they received during the protests, according to the local press.
The tension is still high in the liberation-oriented region one year after the referendum on October 1, which was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming sum of relief, but there was poor attendance because the vote was boycotted by most who opposed the release.
According to the Catholic authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after police tried to halt the vote conducted at polling stations across the region.
Liberation groups camped in the streets on the night of Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration was held, but was forced to take another route.
Narciss Termes (68), an electrician who participated in the separatist prosthesis with his wife, said he no longer had hopes of Catalonia's ability to become independent.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents cry with joy to get their voice, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite having achieved a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalan independence have had problems keeping pressure up this year, as many of their famous leaders have left in self-imposed exile or are in detention while awaiting trial for their role in arranging the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest to support the police, said that the conflict was invented by politicians on both sides.
“The situation becomes more and more tense,” he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been imprisoned in waiting for a trial since late last year, announced that he will be elected to the European Parliament next year.
“To stand for elections as a candidate in the European elections is the best I can do to condemn the repression and regression of democratic values we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three 33, 34, and 39 years have been arrested after a car was driven several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The event took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
An armbow may have also been fired against the car at some point.
Mengas attacks lead to Livingstons 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Mengas first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livinston surprisingly surprised Rangers, who delivered Steven Gerrard's second loss after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
A good match from Dolly Menga proved to be crucial, and Gary Holt's side is now similar to Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side has not yet won away in the Premier League this season and will play against the leaders Hearts, who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Prior to this, the Rangers will play their home match against Rapid Wien in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on his side, has remained undefeated through six games in the division. Chief striker Holt has not yet lost a game after he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston is missing out on opportunities against his sleek guests
Holt's team would have been leading long before they scored, as their direct method caused countless problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but missed the goal, and Alan Lithgow could only send fired on after kicking in to meet Craig Halkett header past the goal.
The host lot of Rangers played in front of them, knowing they could create problems for their guests at deathball.
And that’s how the decisive goal came to be.
Rangers gave off a free kick and Livingston found an opening — Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga a clear path, and he scored a goal from the middle of the box.
Within this stage, the Rangers had held the ball largely all the time, but the home team's defense had been shown to be impermeable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed an almost-scoring that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of Rangers keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston-born ball in a short pass.
Krysings still entered the Livingston box and were still rescued, while two penalty demands - once after Halkett's protest against the substitute Glenn Middleton, and once in hand - were translated.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were amazing all together and continue to surpass all expectations on the road up.
The game style and crew have barely changed since they got to the top again, but Holt will have a lot of credit for the way he has strengthened the team after his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and coordinated a hugely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worall on his toes all through the game.
Rangers, however, did not have my inspiration to sign up with.
Although at times they have been very good under Gerrard, they were unable to live up to this standard.
The last part of the match was laber - they only got into the home team's ground half once - and it was a bit of a crack for the Rangers, which is located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just smiling and blue sky on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the NATO allies.
There have been tensions over issues such as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police raised security as the reason why a crowd of 25,000 was not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters met near to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them Kurds - also heard from themselves, criticizing both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to drop him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the suffering that follows a man hailed as a hero of some German Turks and hated as an autocratic of others.
Deptford collision: Syklist killed in collision by car
A cyclist is killed in a collision as with a passenger car in London.
The collision took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a busy trail in Deptford south-east of the city, around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by ambulance personnel, but the man died on the spot.
The collision takes place only one month after a cyclist died in a car accident where the driver escaped from the scene in Children's Street, about one kilometer from Saturday's collision.
Metropolitan Police said police are working to identify the man and alert the relatives.
Road stops and bus traffic are in place, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers are injured in an incident at a high-security prison for men, according to the prison authorities.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. BST on Sunday, and are still ongoing.
Specialized "Torrnado" officers are brought in to deal with the incident, involving eight inmates and are limited to one wing.
The girls were treated for less facial injuries on the site.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Sepesia-led prison staff have been sent to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees are treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons — the responsible will be transferred to the police, and may have to spend even more time behind locks and beats.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison leader received hospital care after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, the riot police were called to deal with a serious incident in which the employees were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flood (may be beneficial for drought areas)
It is the source of Arizona being hit by a tropical depression, but just as it will likely happen early next week, as Hurricane Rosas' remaining force moves through the desert areas of the southwest and carries floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rain will start late Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has remarked on Twitter that only "ti tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the border to Arizona.
The last National Hurricane Center models anticipate 5-10 cm of precipitation, with up to 15 cm in some places in Mongollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas within the desert in the southwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, will probably get between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of precipitation is possible in some areas.
For those outside of the floodfares, Rosa can be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this rainfall will probably be beneficial, since the southwest U.S. currently is in a drought state.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa hits land at the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 137 km, is 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves 19 km/h.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and thus loses power.
That is why it is expected to hit Mexico with tropical storm force on Monday evening or afternoon.
The rainfall over parts of Mexico can be severe and lead to great flooding.
"Total precipitation of 7.5-15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with options for up to 25 cm of precipitation", according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the border of Arizona dawn on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which this moves further through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The Hovedfar expected by Rosa or the rest of it is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwest desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said.
This rainfall is expected to produce life-threatening flooding and liquid debris and rapid in the desert and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Attacks for Murder Attempts
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man are arrested, suspected of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teen boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 04:00 BST on Sunday.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition should be stable.
A 17-year-old, two-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
Police have asked anyone who can have mobile footage of the incident to contact.
Trump says Kavanaugh has "lid under the pettyness and mind" of the Democratic Party
“A voice to support Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the ruthless and shocking tactic of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in front of a public meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "lid under the pettyness and mind" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, denying severe and emotional charges by Christine Blasey Ford that he committed a sexual assault against her several decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about his accusation during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw how brilliant, skillful and brave" Kavanaugh was that day.
“A voice to support Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to support one of our time’s skilled lawyers, with plettfried water in public service,” he told a crowd of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred the discourse to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about how important it is that the Republicans vote in the middle elections.
“We’re five weeks away from one of our lifetime’s most important choices.
“I’m not really a participant, but I’m a participant,” he said.
“That’s why I travel around and fight for the best candidates.”
Trump pointed out that the Democrats aim to "motivate and prevent".
The Senate's first midterm vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later Friday, according to the assistant of a leader in the Republican Party.
Hundreds of people killed by Indonesian landslides and tsunamis, the numbers are expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were dragged out to sea by huge waves that dubbed the beaches when a large earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters of high waves dubbed in land around sunset, destroyed everything in their way, and went many into the drinking death.
The tsunami came to the heels of an earthquake with magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami grandfather emerged yesterday, people still drive activities on the beach, did not immediately escape and ended up as victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, Indonesia's spokesperson for emergency management (BNBP) at a Jakarta press conference.
"The tsunami was not alone - it went with cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coast line.
Some climbed up trees to escape the tsunami and survived.”
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centimetres in Palu.
Air photographers published by the emergency management agency showed many broken buildings and shops, distorted and crushed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The line of earthquakes could be felt by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s agency for the assessment and use of technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the power of Friday’s enormous earthquake was around 200 times more than the power of the atomic bomb released over Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami larger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the damage as "excellent" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the death figures and damage could be larger land coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area named Donggala, located closer to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication "was completely crippled, completely without information" from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there," said Red Cross in a press release, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, but the authorities said the waves had hit before the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building called desperate warnings that the tsunami approaches to passing on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water comes daunting towards the beach, tearing up buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately authenticate the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major influx of power that has prevented communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The military has begun to send transport aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuations still desperately need food and other necessities.
The city’s airport is only open for relief work, and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widododo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The deaths after the tsunami in Indonesia rise above 800.
It's absolutely cruel.
The World Vision staff from Donggala have come safely to the Palu city centre, where they have sought shelter under the pressure tent in the courtyard in front of their office, but they passed great devastation on the road, according to Doseba Sinay.
“They told me they saw hundreds of broken houses,” he said.
It's absolutely cruel.
The help organizations began the gloomy preparations to provide emergency relief, complaining some that foreign aid workers with a lot of expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released into a crisis area before it is declared a national disaster area.
It just hasn't happened yet.
“There is still a provincial disaster,” said Alia Arriani, a spokesperson for Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘Greit, this is a national disaster’, we can open the borders of international aid, but the situation has not yet been achieved.”
As the sun descends across Palu for the second time after Friday’s earthquake, tsunami hopes friends and family of those still missing that their loved ones should be among the miracles that illuminate the gloomy news image after tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was fished out of a sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was freed by rescue crews after spending two days trapped under ruins with the body of her mother next door.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paraglids for the Asian Games, which were carried out earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those caught in the ruins of Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional should bear,” he said.
Gendon told them that in the hours after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the practitioners who participated in the Palu beach festival.
But the messages only led to gray chin marks, rather than a pair of blue chin marks.
“I think it means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Tyver steals USD 26 750 during minibank refill in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $2,650 from a Brink's worker who filled a ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied a minibank in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While busy, there was another man who "runs behind the Brink's employee" and stole a money bag that would be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects escape from the scene, according to the press release, but police have not specified how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity must contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The creature previously known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for longer, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was launched in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the program, after she cancelled "emotional basis", according to the seriesmaker.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious significance to him.
"I think 'yes' is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when he discussed the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
It went from being Kanye, meaning the only one, to just Ye, as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more of a representation of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with West, has also varied between the use of hyphens and large letters.
Mexico’s AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's appealing president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has sworn that he will never use military power against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he “never will ever use the military to suppress the Mexican people.”
Military troops shot at a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, during a period when left-wing student movements struck the root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of education opportunities lead young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double economic support for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, investor and practitioner of artificial intelligence, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements about artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the United States generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, on its side, introduced a plan last year and aims to be number 1 in innovation for artificial intelligence by 2030.
“A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough,” Lee said.
Double financial support can double the chance that the next major performance in artificial intelligence comes from the United States,” Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop a system of artificial intelligence that beat the United States' best Othello player, and later was a leader of Microsoft Research or director of Google's Chinese department.
Lee recognized the former U.S. government technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next will be detained, to help find the next generation of wise heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to receive government grants, according to Lee.
"It's not China who steals the academic leaders, it's the companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired wise heads from universities to work with artificial intelligence in later years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen its efforts in artificial intelligence.
“I believe that those who have a doctorate in artificial intelligence should receive an offer of residence permit automatically,” he said.
China's State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the development of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation funds people at academic institutions, in a similar way as the National Science Foundation and other state organizations share money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the United States Defense Department created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative named AI Next.
As regards NSF, they are currently investing more than USD 100 million in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the U.S. legislation aims to establish a national security commission for artificial intelligence has been stopped for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether the country's name should be changed
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province named Macedonia, believes that the name of the northern neighbor constitutes a requirement for Greek territory, and has vetoed it against including them in NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered an agreement in June based on the proposed new hub, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has created doubts about whether the meeting will meet the minimum 50 percent requirement, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question of the ballot is: "Are you for NATO and EU membership by approval of the agreement with Greece."
Those who support the change of names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that arose after Yugoslavia’s fall, should be able to gain membership in organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU’s protective umbrella, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, it will probably be crucial because a high enough number of Members of Parliament have said that they will comply with the outcome of the vote.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The government’s election commission has said that they had not received any irregularities reports by 13.00.
However, the meeting was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 per cent of registered voters gave their vote.
“I came to vote because of my children — we belong to Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski (62), who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko votes in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The referendum in Macedonia is about changing the country's name to open the doors for them to become members of NATO and the EU.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) clarified a small scene and pulled out chairs in front of tents set up by those to boycott the vote.
“We are positive at NATO and the EU, but we will be enrolled with raised head, not being swallowed in the back road,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our value.
If they don’t accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will lead badly displaced investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think most people will be too, because more than 80 of our residents want us to become a member of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He says that a “yes” response will be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonia Institute for Political Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voter participation in the referendum will be lower than the required meeting.
Another survey conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV showed that 57 percent of black people have plans to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they were going to vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the meeting must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it would constitute the first serious political barrier the pro-Western government has encountered since it took over in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero maneuvers past all Brighton's defenses to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a goal in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a pass at the start of the sequence.
He raced with three Brighton defenders before getting out on an open track.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender before running from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a pass to the left that reached Sterling.
The English attacker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used right shoes to beat Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero still struggles with some foot problems,” City manager Pep Guardiola told the press.
“We talked about the fact that he was going to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was lucky that he scored a goal right now.”
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the original advantage of the Premier League game.
This goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball put inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough pass along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a couple of touchs before he led Sterling to the longest corner.
Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the net right before it was over the dead line.
City plays against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12:55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be the spoiler for Rockies
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs, and have no reason to be strong.
However, the always equally competitive Scherzer hopes to be on the track on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoffs of the Colorado team, leading over the Los Angeles Dodgers with one game in the NL West.
Rockies got a wild card spot with a 5-2 win over National's Friday night, but are still looking to secure their first division title.
Although we don’t have anything to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the mood here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will be the most likely to be the highest level of combat I get to play this year.
Why wouldn’t I participate in it?”
The Nationals have still not announced their start pitcher for Sunday, but are allegedly inclined to take Scherzer pitche in such a situation.
Sherzser, who, in this case, is starting pitcher for 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has won 18 games and lost 7, with an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strikeouts of 220 2/3 innings.
Trump's National Assembly in West Virginia
The president referred the discourse to the situation surrounding the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while talking about how important it is that Republicans vote in the middle elections.
"All we've done is play in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not a participant, but I'm a participant. That's why I travel around and fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this cruel, cruel group with radical Democrats, you see it happen right now.
And they are determined to take power back at all costs. There you see the pettyness and the badness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they must overcome to gain power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we won’t give it to them.”
Democrates, he said, aim to "motivate and prevent".
"And you see it over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "not and bad and dishonest."
He referred to the Senate Court Committee and mentioned Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein by name, on which the public arched loudly.
“Do you know her answer?
Have you read the document?
About, what.
No, no, no, I'm waiting for one - it was very bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They don’t tolerate people who say their opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly a surprise.
I am, after all, the last in a long series of Labour MPs who have been told that we are not welcome, just because we say what we mean.
My Parliamentary Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I would be censored because I didn’t agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
Concerning how important it is to have responsible economic policies, regarding national security, concerning Europe — ironically enough similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with former leaders.
At the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it stated that “we want meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday nights have been exactly this.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the mood of many of the meetings, and the promise of ‘mysteries, friendly’ policy is too long forgotten if it ever began.
It becomes increasingly apparent that different opinions are not allowed in the Labour Party, and all opinions are judged based on whether they are acceptable to the party management.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I previously thought that I shared many political positions with suddenly began to expect me to take a U-wing and stand for opinions I had never before agreed, they agreed with the nation's security or the EU's internal market.
When I speak publicly, and it doesn’t matter what I say — I receive a wealth of ugly messages on social media that require me to be dismissed, condemns the center policy, and tells me that I shouldn’t be in Labour.
And that's not just me who's experienced this.
I know I’m more fortunate to be one of my colleagues because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they meet a sea of gender discrimination and racist comments every day, but never let go of cow.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how gross carving has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a tolerance culture.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to everyone, and every mistrust proposal and every change in electoral rules becomes the party narrower.
I have received many advice over the past two years where I am encouraged to keep my head low and not raise the voice so much, because it will “make everything better.”
But that’s not why I was involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by Thatcher government neglect that had led my classroom to the public school I went to was literally fallible, I have fought for better public services for those who need them the most, both as local councillor and government minister.
I have never hidden my political opinions, nor in the previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East can have misunderstood my political attitudes or disagreements with the current management.
To those who put forward the representative proposal on Friday, I will just say that as our country rages against a Brexit that will harm private individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot grasp and understand the desire to waste time and forces on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum - it is to those I represent, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of dismissal or political compromise will prevent me from doing what I believe best in your interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatered Ayr rises to the top
Two late attempts have changed the final score a bit, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this fantastic entertaining Tennent's Premiership game.
They are now at the top of the table, and are the only undefeated of the ten.
In the end, it was as much their superior defense as their ability to use the opportunities they got that the home team went off with the victory, and coach Peter Murchie had a good reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been challenged in our fights so far and are still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “All honor to Ayr, they were better at using the possibilities than we were.”
Grant Anderson's attempts in the 14th minute, with a goal kick from Frazier Climo gave Ayr the lead, but a yellow card to the Scotland cabinet Rory Hughes, loaned from Warriors, made Melrose out of position, and Jason Baggott performed an attempt without a goal kick.
Climo strengthened Ayr's leadership with a penalty kick before he, right before the break, scored and the goal park a solo attempt to change the position to 17-5 at a break.
But Melrose started the second half strong, and Patrick Anderson's attempts, with a goal kick from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This was a longer stay in connection with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was worn out in the springs, and from the restart Ayr increased management even more ed an attempt by Stafford McDowell, with a goal kick from Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blain Macpherson, then got yellow cards and Melrose took advantage of having an extra man on the field to the fullest with an attempt by Bruce Colvine without a goal park, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the home team came back strongly, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for dealing with Climo when he didn't have the ball, MacPherson performed a touchdown at the entrance behind the advancing Ayr maul.
Climo performed a goal park, as he did again almost completely from restart, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's boxing park and sent flanking Gregor Henry to the home team's fifth attempt.
Still the Game Star is ready for a new career in the restaurant business
It appears that Still Game star Ford Kieran is on his way into the server business — it was recently discovered that he is named as the director of a restaurant company with scepticism.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC program, which he writes script for and plays together with his long-term comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
Duen has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last season of the series, and it seems Kiernan is now planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public listings, he is the director of Avangmorn Limited.
The actor wouldn't comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to involve in Glasgow's "live restaurant fire".
"Havet is ours: Bolivia, a country without coastline, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol a rigged marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have a sea blue flag.
Marine bases from the Titicaca Lake to Amazonas are decorated with the motto: "We are right to the sea.
It is our duty to regain it."
The entire inland state of Bolivia still has fresh in memory of the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, and the country longs to once again sail on the Pacific Ocean.
These openings may be greater than they have been for decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of discussion.
"Bolivia has a driving force, community spirit and mind, and, of course, awaits the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivarians will see the verdict from the International Court of Justice at large screens in many different places in the country, hoping that the Court of the Hague will give its sense in favor of Bolivia's claim that Chile, after decades of sporadic negotiations, is committed to negotiating to provide Bolivia with its own outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president, facing a controversial re-election campaign next year, has also been betting a lot on Monday's verdict.
“We are very close to a return to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly take Bolivia's party, and that very little would change if it had done so.
The UN body, which has been held in the Netherlands, has no authority that allows them to give away Chilean lands, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law will only be six months after the last arguments were heard that the case was "not complicated", according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert.
And rather than promoting Bolivia’s case, the last four years can actually have made things worse.
"The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
She believes that Morales' antagonistic rhetoric has removed any remaining goodwill on Chile's side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at one point or another, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the theory that the court's decision came unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new generation of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “set an end to 139 years of disagreement, in favor of both parties.”
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, has used the maritime situation as a political shell fire.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
“The feeling is a reason to see what we have to do to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless they can rely on the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never overthrow its nuclear weapons if they cannot rely on U.S. authorities.
He spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to comply with promises they gave during a meeting between the two conflicting countries’ leaders in Singapore.
These comments come at the same time as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be ready to initiate the locked nuclear diplomat, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a "desired dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. resistance are a declaration ending the Korean War will ever force North Korea to knee.
U.S. authorities are skeptical of accepting the declaration without Pyongyang first implementing significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to have a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt as to whether Pyongyang really plans to let go of an arsenal the country is likely to look at as the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion views in Paris reveal the latest in the field of huge headgear, which is heading towards a clothing store near you
If you want some big additions to the hat collection or hide you completely from the sun, you don’t need to look any further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a selection of distinctive, oversized head garments as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the fashion boots on the moteuka in Paris.
Very impractical hats have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
Valentino's most uplifting garment was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a spring-like broad strap that drowned the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-packed watermelons, a wizard hat or even an pineapples, but they are not designed to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks - just in time to Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had repainted lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than last screams.
One creation memory of dive equipment, including snorkeling and dive glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream in biscuits.
And if you’re looking for even more great fashion accessories, then you’re lucky.
Style experts predict that the huge hats can be on the way to a clothing store near you.
The oversized hats come right in the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a half-meter-wide strap that has been seen on everyone and everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratakijkowski.
The magnificent back of the very impractical hat that dominated social media has now sent another great creation down the catwalk - a beach bag in straw that is almost as large as the swimsuit model carrying it.
The orange electrofive, which is edged with electrofiafryns and complete with a white leather handle, was the most conspicuous creation in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at opposingeuka in Paris.
Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the clothing stores next summer — when the designer has had such a big impact, it will be difficult to oversee the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are crucial to world citizens
Scotland's free schools are constantly exhibiting academic excellence, and this has persisted in 2018 with enough one year of outstanding exam results. These are underpinned by individual and common success in sports, art, music and other community measures.
These schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (the Scottish Free School Council), have more than 30,000 students across Scotland, working hard to deliver the very best school experience for both students and parents.
Schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an education agency that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and sought-after elective in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands when his words head.
If you speak to him in his own language, when the words of his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we can not only stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s exam results, we see that languages are located at the top of the table with the highest pass percentages from free schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received the graduate grade A.
The data obtained from the 74 member school council showed that 72 percent of students received the graduate grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French and 63 percent of those studying Spanish also received A.
This illustrates that free schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a crucial skill children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as a subject choice is now valued at the same level as science, technology, engineering and mathematics at the curriculum for free schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that due to the causes of employers’ problems in possessing a vacancy, 17 percent could be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly important to prepare young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become crucial in a globalized world.
If you have learned a second language, these lifelong skills will give real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey, by more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a two-digit number of participants (15 percent) could speak.
This is why investment in language education is now crucial to today’s children.
To be able to speak more languages, especially those associated with emerging economies, will provide children with better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland, if every school teaches different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages that are considered most valuable for Britain on the road towards 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what interests your child, there will always be a selection of languages to choose from in schools, with teachers who are experts in this area.
Scottish Free Schools aim to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the knowledge and abilities they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today’s global business environment that language is still crucial to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
Modern languages should, in fact, be considered as "international communication ability".
Schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and the award for Scotland’s youth.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron is reported to have his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait time is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play for Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play on Sunday's season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play is still not decided.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James will likely play a limited number of minutes.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for Lakers' six-game preseason plan.
“I don’t need preseason games in this stage of my career,” he replied.
Time of Trump's Summit in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President begins a series of election meetings tonight Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump’s five scheduled public meetings in the next week, including stoppages in cities where he has a lot of support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the affirmation vote for his selected Supreme Court candidate has been put on hold, Trump aims to obtain support for the upcoming elections, since Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voters go to the ballots in November.
When is Trump's West Virginia Summit tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to start at 7:00 ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s Summit in West Virginia online below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss the weekly hearings for Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual abuse. A expected confirmation vote is put on hold for up to one week while the FBI investigates the case.
With the main objective of all these meetings, it is to support Republicans facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump has therefore said that these five public meetings over the next few weeks aim to "build volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so crucial for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while moving towards a busy campaign season," Reuters was told by a campaign spokesperson for Trump who did not want to be named.
The night’s meeting, which is scheduled to take place at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, may attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, and is covered by the Pittsburgh press,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time during the last month of Trump’s visit to West Virginia, a state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is in the polls.
“It’s a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a boost on the polls,” said Simon Haeder, an expert at political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows combat spirit to keep faith as they enter Sunday's singles game
After three unilateral sessions, Saturday’s waterfalls may have been exactly what the year’s Ryder Cup needed.
Momentum's swinging pendulum is a completely fictional sports concept, yet some players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
"They led by six points and now there are four, so we carry it well with us as a little moment," said Jordan Spieth when he left the field for the day.
Europe, of course, will have the advantage - they lead with four points and it's 12 again to play for.
But as Spieth says, Americans feel that they’ve got some wind in their sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent games from tee to green, and leads by example.
The deep celebrations became higher as his round continued, and sank to a crucial putting to raise the match to a draw when he and Thomas were two under two.
His breathing, which won them the match of 15, was met with a similar scream — of the sort that shows that he still does not believe the American team is chanceless.
“We really just have to put all the clusters to and focus on our own match,” Spieth said.
All of these players have now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are undoubtedly the great success story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s unusual but glorious couple have four out of four and don’t put a foot wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who escaped a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the bogey’s Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the lively crowd make it clear that they are the biggest competitors of Sunday, and there are no other players in the public rather will see a European victory as the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
At least both at the same time, in each hole.
However, it is too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson led easily up with Sergio Garcia, the morning football hero, when he was partnered with Alex Noren.
After one book and two doubles during the first nine holes, the Spanish and Swedish were so far on demand that they did not have the nubbessjans to take over the fortification.
On Sunday, there is no help to get.
Fourballs and waterfalls are very interesting to look at close teams because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give each other, the advice they don’t give and how a strategy can turn into a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is far ahead of the last day, but this waterfall session also showed that Team USA has the battle spirit of some, especially in the United States.
Europe leads 10-6 at the start of last day in Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong leap at the start of Ryder Cup's last day, after completing Sunday's football and waterfalls match with 10 to 6 leadership against the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two wins against a broken Tiger Woods, raising their score for Le Golf National as far as four points.
Thomas Bjørn's European side, fighting to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's unlucky side in the morning's footballs and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. gave more resistance to waterfalls and won two games, but they did not receive any of the predicament.
Jim Furyk's side must collect eight points from Sunday's 12 singles game to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari - who together have been nicknamed "Milliwood" after a sensational weekend - is the only couple to score four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in football, they collaborated seamlessly to defeat the broken Woods and U.S. rookie Bryson Dechambeau with even more posthumous 5&4.
Woods, who limped through two matches on Saturday, glimpsed to among others, has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in football and waterfalls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested at morning footballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in fourssomes and performed a 2&1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked number one and three worldwide.
But Europe did not get everything they wanted on this warm day with light breeze south-west of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won majors three times, set the standard for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard hit 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in football, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in waterfalls after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team managed to pick up after a four-point prelude at the start of the single game, but as current holders only need Furyks side to achieve a tie to keep the trophy.
But after being the second best in two days, it does not seem that they will be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea will "in no way" agree unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that sanctions continued to strengthen the distrust of the United States, and that the country will in no way agree to unilaterally let go of its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual General Assembly that North Korea has implemented “decent goodwill measures” over the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test area and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We have not seen any similar response from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not, under any circumstances, unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints on Washington's opposition to a gradual nuclear disarmament, where North Korea is rewarded for the gradual downturn, but his statement was significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on 12 June, at the very first meeting between a sitting president of the United States and a North Korean leader, in which Kim pledged to work against the "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has called for a formal conclusion of the Korean War that took place from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first let go of its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to reduce strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament first', raising pressure via sanctions to achieve its goal of coercion, and even countering the 'the declaration of war'," Ri said.
“The belief that sanctions can force us in the knees is a desire for people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions create further distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for a second match between Kim and Trump as the U.S. leader highlighted in front of the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months, adding: "If the other party in this disarmament case was South Korea, rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have been as fixed as it is."
However, the tone of Ris' speech was very different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on mainland US with North Korea's missiles was inevitable after "Mr Onde President" Trump called Kim a "racettmann" on a suicide mission.
After threatening to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, Trump stood in front of the UN and praised Kim to be brave enough to take down the disarmament steps, but said that much work remains, and sanctions must remain applicable to North Korea is nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he did not have a time frame for this, saying, "It has nothing to say if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures implemented.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: “The sanctions of the Security Council must still be enforced vigorously and without exception, until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to raise funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile weapons program.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, and afterwards said he wanted to visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He went from Pyongyang in July and said that they had been successful, but only hours after accused North Korea he had come with "gender claims".
North Korea committed itself to a meeting with Moon this month to put down a missile area and a nuclear plant if the United States made "similar measures".
He said Kim had said that these "similar measures" he wants were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures for normalization of Washington's relationship.
Students at Harvard take courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is going to help students get more sleep by tackling the growing unculture of puddleing through the night with caffeine.
An academic found that students at the world’s best universities often did not have a bearing on how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He started the course after he held a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"After the lecture, a girl came to me and said, 'Why is there no one who has said this before?'
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and it surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which starts up this year, explains the students how important it is with good sleep habits to be able to perform academically and sportingly, and for the general state.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and adm. dir. for university health services, said the university decided to start the course after they saw that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation.
The course, which lasts for an hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a room in a dormitory, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, jogging shoes and books and hear about the effects of caffeine and light and how sporting performance is influenced by sleep deprivation, and how important it is with a sleep routine.
In another part, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus with interactive icons makes participants think of their daily routine.
“We are aware that this is not going to change student behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know about this, in the same way that you have the right to know about the risk of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
There is still some pride in being able to breathe all night, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students led to sleep deprivation being an increasing problem.
Enough and good sleep should be the students’ “secret weapons” against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said — even as a means of weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in hunger mode, leading to constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course. He took one of the classes to the professor last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course inspired him to work for a course that was available to the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all the master students to take a similar study program before enrolling at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students set an alarm for when they were to sit as well as when they were to stand up, and that they had to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic displays and LED lights. This type of light can disrupt the rhythm and lead to sleep difficulties.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Goals of Menga Strike Out Gerrard's Men
Rangers suffered another loss when Dolly Mengas goal defeated Steven Gerrard's team 1-0 on Livingston.
The Ibrox side wanted to win its first victory since February's victory 4-1 on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager and left since his eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership leader Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers never managed to outright.
Rangers fall down in sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to third and is behind Hibernian on target difference.
There may be more trouble in the honors of Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was thrown from away audiences.
Gerrard made eight trades on the team, which swept past Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 which took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been happy how his well-trained team defeated the opponents.
Rangers probably had the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They would have scored just two minutes into the game when Mengas first pass sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder played the chance.
A long free kick by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot against the target line.
Rangers took control, but it looked like their game leaned more on hope than belief in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos believed he would have had a penalty kick after a quarter, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson refused.
Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not get problems with Lassana Coulibalys header and a tam kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livis's opening for 34 minutes may have been against the game's run, no one can deny that they deserved it for the strike.
Again, Rangers failed to deal with a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cold when he chose Menga for a simple ending.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent in the break, and the player exchange gave immediate results when the winger sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get the away players to play just the kind of game they like, like Lithgow and Halkett caught up long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched the lead in the last round, but McGregor stood up against Jacobs before the Lithgow head from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had a late claim for a penalty kick as he ended up in conflict with Jacobs, but again Thomson passed away.
Almanaken: The inventor of the geigereller
And now a page from the "Sunday Morning" calendar: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "His" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the apparatus we know today as the geigereller.
The Geigertelleren has been an important part of science since then, and also became part of popular culture via the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What in the world is it?”
Rogers: "It's a geigerteller. It finds radioactive minerals like uraniumium.
When you take these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms as the radioactivity of the minerals emits.”
Evans: “Shall it make sound now!”
His Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention he gave his name, lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaksine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory
Cells can now "see" a protein that is common in many cancers, and then injected into the patient again
A vaccine during the trial has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, experienced that the ovarian cancer she suffered from disappeared for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein called HER2, which is typically too many cancer forms, and then injected these cells into the patient again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland said: "The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "driven growth of different cancer types", including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure, in which immune cells were taken from the patient and “trained” to correct cancer cells, has worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, wearing an MAGA hat, brought fierce defenses of Trump after the SNL appearance.
It didn't work well.
Kanye West was booked in the studio at Saturday Night Live after a famed appearance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for election in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he longed out against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
"It happens so often that I speak to a white person, and then he says, 'How can you like Trump, he's racist?'
“If I was afraid of racism, I had moved from the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's explanation for the Senate Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual abuse that Christine Blasey Ford promoted.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West was uploaded in social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock wanted to ridicule West by posting the recording.
West also complained to the public that he heard it in the back room regarding the choice of headgear.
"They bullied me.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat."
They bullied me!
And then they said I don’t know what the reality is,” he told Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see that I understand what the reality is?” he said, saying that he would “take on me the Superman cup because then no one can say what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try love.”
His comments were arched at least twice, and the employees who worked at SNL then flew out reported Variety, where a staff member said: "The whole studio was fatal."
West was brought in as the last minor substitute for singer Ariana Grande when her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he performed the song "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of our bravest: TAKK FOR AT YOU STREAT IMOT MASSENS.”
But the talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "what he is and it's absolutely amazing".
“But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothing or supporting his art that I believe cultivate and question ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
We are, too," she added.
Before the show announced the rapper on Twitter that he had changed his name, he said that from now on he was "the creature formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapperkolly Snoop Dogg has had the name Snoop Lion. So, of course, it is the late musical legend Prince, who changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Suspected of murder attempt after stabbing at restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with murder attempts after a man was stabbed at a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
They are expected to be prepared for Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The statement will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington longs out against "gipit masculinity"
Kit Harington is known from the role of sword winger Jon Snow in HBO’s violent fantasy series added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone out and criticized the stereotype of the machohelten and says such roles on film often cause young men to believe they must be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said something has gone wrong and wondered how to attack the problem of "toxic masculinity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones-cool Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, acknowledged that he was very concerned with the theme.
“It worries me quite a bit at the moment — where did it go wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“How have we raised men in terms of the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that TV may have parts of the blame for the increase in "toxic masculinity" due to the strong masculine roles.
He continued: “What is congenital and what is allowed?
What is communicated on TV and on the street, what makes young boys feel like they have to grow this side by being a man?
I think it’s one of the really big questions of our time — how can we change it?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also admits that he will not do any precursors or successors of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play the lead role in a remake of Sam Shepard True West. This is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife during the recordings, so in that way something good came out of it -- my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygrette, as Kits character Jon Snow is in love with the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820 000 people are affected in the country, says health representative.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The large majority of new cases are transferred via sex, marking a change from earlier.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China by infection through blood transfusions.
But the number of people getting HIV in this way is now closer to zero, Chinese health professionals said at a conference in Yunnan province.
This year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men are married to women.
Much of the disease is due to insufficient protection in sex in these conditions.
Since 2003, China’s authorities have promised general access to HIV medicine as part of a measure to address the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects that co-workers leaked data about Republican senators, fudges of "dangerous liars" and "conspiracy theories"
Member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, rejected Saturday allegations that members of her staff had posted the personal information to three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lawmakers.
The Democrat from Los Angeles assured by the allegations was made by "ultra conservatives" commentators and websites.
“Langers, liars, and more repugnant liars,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information included alleged home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the web Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate on the abuse allegations against Chief Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came a bit after the three Senators had been suing Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Puritt and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was traced to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of Waters' staff, according to Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely incorrect and a rule of law lies," Waters continued.
"The members of my staff - who have received their identities, personal information and security compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false charges - certainly had no responsibility for the leak of this information.
This unbiased accusation is completely incorrect and a rule of law lies.”
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, among others by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is aggressive," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she does not have the right temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be aggressive.
They can't go into defense.
They must not incur the motives of the prosecutor.
They have to act calmly and understand.”
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of acting aggressively during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who works to remove Waters in the middle elections, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great, if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had notified "relevant authorities and police of these false charges".
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are revealed,” she continued, “and that they are held accountable for all actions destructive and dangerous to each of my staff.”
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - bloody Rowan Atkinson in spy parody
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit interpretations in all new films with a British slash and it seems to be appropriate for this revival of the parodifranchis Johnny English action comedy, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and restoire in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic self-sacrifice on how obviously hopeless we are to become the nation’s new export product?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his bulging eyes and the rubber face has been re-released his license to root it to the second time - his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comic figure intended for territories with non-English-speaking cinema audiences.
Of course, he is the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a pusher Mr Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes one note in the music cover with firecar theme during the opening ceremony at the 2012 Olympics in London.
He is also originally based on the role Atkinson played in the longest forgotten television ads for Barclaycard; the traveler and international mysteryman who leaves chaos everywhere.
It’s another great moment in the latest Johnny English behavior.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades sneaked his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy comes to its right, but humor feels quite bloody and strangely superfluous, especially now as the "serious" brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible willingly awaken.
Humor seems to be more targeted to children than adults, and for me, Johnny English feeds just as inventive and pointed as the silent film loops in Mr Bean.
The current premise is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all the British agents in the field, to the perpetrator’s behavior — a regrettable little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister, a pompous and downed figure that already undergoes a complete crisis of political opulence: Emma Thompson does a very good job with this as well as the Teresa-May role, but the script does not give her much to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform that since every active spy has been revealed, she must bring in some among the retired.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher on a snobbed establishment, but gives unofficial instruction in secret intelligence. There are some arty sequences here, when English offers a rock academy for spy activity.
English is pushed back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with its old, plagued helps Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, splintered with a submarine commander, a hysterical upper-class lady role where Vicki Pepperdine is a bit discarded.
So the Batman and Robin style of rooting everything to the mission of the queen is back, where they confront with Olga Kurylenko amazing femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is seduced by the charismatic technology bomber who claims he can solve Britain's cyber problems: the insidious Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start the journey with far-right side positions: disguised as servitators, they set fire on a panging French restaurant. They create chaos while hiding aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English triggers the pure anarchy as he tries to use a VR headset to make himself known in Volta's house.
All stops are really drawn out before the last sequence, but yet so loving and noisy it is so much reminiscent of children's TV with the whole thing.
Pretty mean, it all.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I could not but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets to use his talent?
Labour denies that they prepare plans to let the British work four-day week, but get paid five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a radical plan that will give the British four-day workweek — but get paid for five.
The party will apparently want business leaders to spend savings on the revolution with artificial intelligence by giving employees an extra week day off.
This will result in employees receiving a three-day weekend, while receiving the same salary.
Sources say the idea fits into the party’s economic agenda and plans to move the country in favor of employees.
The unions support the transition to four-day rush so that employees can enjoy the benefits of the new economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It will not happen overnight, but the four-day run is an ambition that fits with the party’s desire to let the pendulum swing to the benefit of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.”
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. Green Party promised four-day run during the campaign before the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the idea is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for Labour said: “A four-day run is not the party’s policy, and is not something that is considered by the party.”
Financial policy spokesman for Labour, John McDonnell, spent the Labour Conference last week deepening his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of "unintended directors" and "prohibitors" of public service providers.
The plan of the Shadow Chancellor also means that current shareholders in water companies are at risk of not getting back the entire stock item because a Labour government can make "drags" out of perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in the corporate boards and create employee funds to transfer 10% of the equity of companies in the private sector to the employees who can receive an annual dividend of 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" about the FBI survey of Kavanaugh can make them change their mind
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has sparked a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court with at least one week and raises the question of the agency's findings can cause some Republican senators to change sight.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked in "60 Minutes" Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open to it than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I told the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked, "Do you want to do that?"
He was determined, sloping, unambiguous.”
However, Graham’s voice seems to be in a rock.
“I’ve decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and that would have to be an up-to-date finding,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied the energetic," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of them she said could not confirm.
It's 36 years ago.
I don’t think anything new will change that.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has helped combat poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive list of stars to perform and an equally impressive mission; eradicate the poverty of the world.
Global Citizen Festival, now inside its seventh year, will have thousands of people streaming to the great lawn in Central Park, not only to experience sizes like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real goal of the event to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to combat poverty by making more people work actively against poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteer work, send email to a world leader, take a phone, or in other meaningful ways to increase awareness around their goals of extinction poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when it is only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to make people fight for changes, or just enough a case of so-called "clickivism" - that people feel they are contributing great by signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011 they have registered more than 19 million “actions” from supporters, with a wealth of different goals.
They say these actions have contributed to getting world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than 37 billion dollars that will improve the situation for more than $225 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group could refer to 390 engagements and announcements as a result of their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funding so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main features are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and entrepreneurs based in the United Kingdom to “help children to exploit their full potential,” and promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizens as you, we can make the social injustice with malnutrition a footnote in history,” said Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in the UK to get better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition measures.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, “What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
Global citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult way — sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the important civil rights and anti-party movements before us, we will succeed because we stand stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who perform at this year's event in New York, which will be led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use the Navy as "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports - the Interior Minister
Washington may "if necessary" to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including in the Middle East, US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially when operating after the invitation of the legal government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flank of Europe," he said.
And according to the spokesperson, there are always ways and means to handle this.
“The United States has the opportunity to ensure that the sea roads are open and, if necessary, block to ensure that the energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at the event held by Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that profiles itself as “the voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s ways of interacting with Russia and Iran, and remarked that they are far too.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as “one trick pony” with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statement came after the Trump administration has been on a round trip to strengthen exports of its liquid natural gas to Europe. They want to replace Russia, the far cheapest option for European consumers.
Members of the Trump administration, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project of the North European gas pipeline 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the "fool of Moscow".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North European gas pipeline worth $11 billion, which will double existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's incandescent resistance to the project is only motivated by economic reasons and is an example of impermeable competition.
"I think we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose supplier," Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has faced opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its obligations in the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, BDI, has asked the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have major problems with third countries that interfere with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, head of BDI after a meeting recently between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, said.
Elizabeth Warren will "think serious" at his 2020 presidential election, said Senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she wanted to "think serious" about whether she would run for president after the election.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she will run.
“It’s time for women to get to Washington and fix the fragile government, and it includes a woman on top,” she said.
“After November 6, I’ll think seriously about whether I’m going to run for president.”
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the election meeting and said he "made the country in the wrong direction".
“I’m worried about what Donald Trump is doing with democracy,” she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course, we need an FBI investigation before voting.”
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe she should run in 2020.
58% of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidate.
The poll showed higher support for former Governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidate and 48% were against it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include vice-president Joe Biden and the Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points out Track Palins PTSD at Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after enlisting in Sept.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
“What my son goes through, what he goes through after coming home, I have in common with other families who experience the consequences of PTSD and some of our vulnerability to our soldiers,” she told the audience at a polling event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans: "They come home a little changed, they come home the army, they come home and wonder if this is the respect for their soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have contributed to the country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence at a woman's home, wearing a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the police in Wasilla.
18 States and D.C. support the trial of new asylum policy
Eight states and the District of Columbia support a legal trial of a new policy in the United States that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. presented a briefing from the Amiscus Curiae (friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, NBC News reported.
The entire name of plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions case as the American Civil Liberties Union was in August against the federal police has not been published.
She claimed that the partner "and his violent gang-member sons" abused her, but government officials in the United States rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations that have pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a decision in 2014 by the Court of Appeal for immigrants who gave undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence law to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Karl Racine of the District of Columbia said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “sing away from many decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires all asylum requirements to be settled based on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such prohibition is contrary to that principle,” said the briefing from the Amiscus Curiae.
Lawyers further argued in the orientation that the policy that denied immigrants access harms the American economy and says that there is a great likelihood that they become entrepreneurs and "bids with necessary labour."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer give asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asyl is available to those who leave home because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political view,” Sessions said in the June 11 statement on politics.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all problems — even all serious problems — that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue action in Palu - deadlies double in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation became even worse.
"It was very tense," said her 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while comforting her fever nurse at an evacuation centre in the confluenced city of Palu.
“All the time you see ambulances coming to the dead.
Clean water is inadequate".
One could see residents who came to ruined homes and easily through water-damaged assets in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were damaged in the earthquake that had strength 7.5, were crowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, sit outside Palus military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing heavy aftershocks.
He gets tears in his eyes when he recounts how it felt when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room in the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save us in safety.
I was hugged by the wall that ran together, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "traking" with "propaganda ads"
A week after a public Chinese newspaper drove a four-page ad in an American newspaper that sued the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the Annex China Daily paid to move into Des Moines Register — the most-selling newspaper in Iowa — after accusing China of attempting to interfere with U.S. congressional elections on November 6, a accusations China rejects.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to influence the US elections marked a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China, U.S. officials said.
It is, of course, normal for foreign authorities to use ads to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has led rounds of new customs rates on each other's import goods.
China's criminal interpreter early in the trade war would hit export businesses in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, reports Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reading post on Sunday’s Des Moines Register: “China steps up the harassment by driving propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading this propaganda, Chinese authorities exploit freedom of expression and the open press that we enjoy in America to insert a paid ad in Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“As a contrast, at the avant-existence on the street here in Beijing you can’t find many dissenting opinions and don’t experience real reflections among the common Chinese around China’s problematic economic course, given that the media is under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added: "One of China's largest newspapers refused the offer to publish his article, although he did not disclose which newspaper it was.
Republicans scare female voters before the election of Kavanaughfadesen, warns analysts
As many top politicians among the Republicans support and defend Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who has received several accusations of sexual assault aimed at them, analysts warn that they will receive a counter-reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming local elections.
The feelings surrounding this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already given signs that they want to move forward with the vote.
“These things cannot be withdrawn,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona) proposed an FBI investigation in the last second will be enough to reassure angry voters.
"Women won't forget yesterday's events - they won't forget it tomorrow and not November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters sang "November is coming!" while protesting the times of the Senate when Republicans controlling the Justice Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the witness statement from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will explode,” said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, to the news page.
“People say it has already been high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among female uncertain voters in the suburbs and younger voters between 18 and 29 years old, who often do not vote even if they dislike the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony that gave detailed description of the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts believed it would be a counter-reaction if Republicans forced through the appointment.
"This has become a sad mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the RNC (Republican National Committee), early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final approval or if Kavanaugh is put in place — it’s also about the way Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priories USA, pointed out.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided over who they should believe in in the wake of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a small majority in favor of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents were completely or quite convinced of Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they were completely or quite convinced of Kavanaugh’s manufacture.
In addition, 38% said they were quite or completely convinced Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
After the playoffs from Flake, the FBI is underway to investigate the allegations made by Ford as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee during ed last week that Kavanaugh in the Berry stand on her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed her genitalis to her while attending the study period at Yale in the 1980s.
The Origin of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the author of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lees’ open source platform Solid.
At Solid, users can choose where their data should be stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose is "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said about the start.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal data storage online" or a POD.
It can include contact lists, work lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What’s unique about the personal data store online is that it’s entirely up to the user who should have access to that type of information.
The company calls it "personalization through data".
The idea behind Inrupt is according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, that the company should run with resources, process and relevant skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some initial developers on contract to work with the project and a gang of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about introducing something completely new or not, which will make their business models completely reverberate overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a post on the Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the debate on online neutrality.
Although he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.

The only priest in the English church to be awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded the honorary honour on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he was awarded the highest British military award.
A memorial was uncovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was a "flot symbolism" in that the stone was to be uncovered exactly 100 years after grandfather's award winning feat.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September — “through very thick fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.”
Later he crashed towards the shot line and led the line "with great courage" forward before storming a field gun self-governing and striking out three of the divisions.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said the actions of the grandfather were “some I knew I could never live up to, but something that makes me humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also put down a crane after the parade, led by the Corps Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said, "He was very honored to play a role in the parade," and added: "The bravery of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people."
MMA supporters were up all night to watch the Bellator 206 martial arts program, instead they got Peppa pig
Make sure you've stayed awake all night to see the tightly packed Bellator 206, just to discover that you don't get to see the main match.
The contestant from San Jose managed through 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown directly through the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the viewers in the UK were sitting to lukewarm when the image suddenly showed Peppa pig.
Some were less impressed after waking up until early morning to see the match.
A trailer described the Twitter transition to the children's program as "a kind of sick joke".
"It is government regulation that it is not appropriate to send such programs at 6:00 p.m., so they had to put over to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication when asked for the broadcast.
"Pepp pig, yes!".
Bellator's CEO, Scott Coker, said they will work on the schedule to include the viewers in Storbrtannia in the future.
“I think we can find out about the fight,” Coker said.
“But it’s at six in the morning on Sunday there, and we won’t be able to resolve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the matter.
Believe me - when we sat over, many messages went back and forth, and they weren't just the kind of kind.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't, it was an authority.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will reduce from six to five matches - as we usually send - and we tried to stretch ourselves far for the supporters, but the tip over.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt less dignified mht. sexuality
Tom Daley says he grew up with a minor sense of interest to everyone because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn’t until the middle school he realized that “he wasn’t like others.”
In the first programme Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular programme manager for the traditional program, Kirsty Young, must be away a few months due to illness.
Daley primarily as a bit of a welcome on Laverne's first broadcast and said he felt "less worth" than anyone else he grew up with because "it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls".
He said: “To this day, these feelings of being less worthy and different that have been the real motivation and have me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he “was something,” he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is twice a bronze winner in the Olympics and has become a highly profiled LGBT ambassador. He used his participation in this year's Commonwealth of Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he stands out because he feels he’s lucky who can live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said that he fell in love with a man - filmmaker Dustin Lance Black of the United States, whom he met in 2013 - "overrunned me".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who was 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you undergo so much at such a young age,” he attended his first Olympics when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later, he said it was tough to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar ups and downturns.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "the whole perspective" his had been changed.
"If you had asked me last year, everything was about me to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than a gold medal in the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had made tickets for London 2012 - since he wanted to sit in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t live long enough to sit on the first line,” he said.
“I kept his hands when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life — to plunge in front of a home audience at the Olympics, the best feeling ever,” he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Proud of Heather Small - which meant a lot for him in the run-up before the Olympics and still giving him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson took out to the golf tournament Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to get in shape if it is not going to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial for impressive 12th time, was put on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk before Saturday's football and football matches.
Instead of being in the center of the event, as he had so often been for the United States, the five-time major winner splits the day between being cheerleader and working on his game at the rank of hoping to correct it as sheds.
The 48-year-old never had the best turn, even at the top of his career and is not in perfect shape for the tight Le Golf National track, where the long Rough area still punishes wilder battles.
And if the pitch itself is not scary enough, Mickelson meets in the ninth game on Sunday, even British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined the beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 singles games, get a successful start, Mickelson's games can prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expresses confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood what role he had today, gave me a pat on his back and let his arm around me and said he would be ready the next day," Furyk said.
"He has great self-confidence.
He is a “Hall of Famer” and has added so much to these teams earlier, and this week.
I didn't think he was going to play two games.
I looked for more, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Fallos record for the most played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely reached up to his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven tie, but Furyk said his participation added some intangible values to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, and likes to drive the garden with others. He's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun trying to get him to this week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives a lot more than just the game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjørn knows his great leadership will soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a significant management at the entrance to the final day singles game in Ryder Cup can quickly transform into an unpleasant round.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five point lead over the Americans, but the vessel to victory with at least a margin of 141⁄2-131⁄21⁄2.
"You still remind yourself that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but just saw," Bjørn, photographed after seeing Class of 2018 winning 5-3 on Friday and headed 10-6 at Le National Golf.
So the story will show me and everyone else on that team that this is not over.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you get the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it’s trying to win this trophy, and that’s where the focus lies.
I’ve always said that I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we’re very aware of what’s on the other side — the best golfers in the world.”
Bjørn is very excited about how his players have succeeded in the tough golf course and adds: “I couldn’t do it better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow, there are individual performances at the center, and there is something completely different.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you’re out alone, your achievements as a golfer will be tested for the full.
It is the message that you must convey to the players that they must get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave the partner, and he must also go out and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjørn, the opponent Jim Furyk will try to make his players perform better individually than they did as partners. The exception is Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the major upheavals last day. He was on the winning team at Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe performed the "miracle at Medinah".
I remember every condemned word of it," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had ravaged his players at the entrance to the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to get a good start as we experienced at Brookline, as we saw at Medinah.
When the moment starts to move in one direction, it puts a big pressure on the middle matches.
We arrange our setup then and send out the people in the way we feel. You know, we try to create something magical tomorrow.
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the game and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the upper half of the player line.
“I’m betting on this group of men in that order because I think it stands all the way,” Bjørn said about his choice of single players.
Germany's new warship delayed once again
German navy’s latest frigate would have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the days of the Cold War, but it will not happen until the next year due to failing systems and galloping costs, local media reported.
The completion of the Rhineland-Pfalz, the carrier of the brand new frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been subjected to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, who quoted a military spokesperson.
The vessel would have been handed over to the Navy in 2014, but the major problems after delivery pursued the ambitious project.
The four vessels in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class Navy ordered completely back in 2007, will replace the old frigates in the Bremen class.
It is agreed that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a variety of anti-aircraft missiles and some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it would be possible to use the latest frigates for up to two years away from the home port.
Still delays, however, mean that the advanced warships - they were said to give Germany strength on the sea - will already be out of date before they are put in service, Die Zeit said.
The fateful F125 retreat created headlines last year, when German navy officially refused to put the vessel in operation and returned it to the shipyard of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the return, but German media mentioned a number of important "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important since vessels in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older frigates in the Bremen class.
It was also revealed that the ship has a huge excess weight, which reduces performance and limits the Navy's ability to make upgrades in the future.
The 7th-ton tongue "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price tag on the entire project, including the training of the crew, has also begun to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros, from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems surrounding the new frigates are particularly important in the light of fresh warnings that Germany's naval force shrinks.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German government's defense committee, confirmed that the Navy actually "going empty for useful ships".
The official said the problem has escalated over time because old ships were deployed, but no new vessels arrived.
He regrets that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the Navy.
The National Trust is eavesdropping on the secret life of the flag mouse
New research carried out at a country property in the Scottish Highlands will reveal how bats use the landscape in the hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help design future conservation measures.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and dwarf bats as well as brown-lane and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recordings will be placed at important locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also perform mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Experts’ sound analyses of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bats and what species do what.
Then a habitat map and a report will be prepared to create a detailed landscape image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will be included in the decision on the measures to be introduced, such as planting pastures and how to best preserve the forest for bats and other associated species.
The flagrims population of Scotland and the United Kingdom has sunk considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and construction work that affects breeding sites and incursion of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, the same with fly paper and certain chemical treated building materials as well as attacks from hedge taxes.
In fact, bats are not blind.
But because of their night hunting habits, they have more use for the ears than the eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echo localization to find insects and obstacles on the road when they fly.
NTS, responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 77,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten skilled experts who regularly perform surveys, surveying breeding spaces and sometimes rescue work.
The organization has also established Scotland’s first and only national flag museums reserve at the Three Land property in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten flag museums.
Property Manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
“Here on the Threave we have a perfect area for bats,” he says.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and by other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.”
He emphasizes how important it is to map the bats before maintaining a property since inadvertent destruction of a single breeding site can kill up to 400 females and young people, and perhaps emigrate a whole local population.
Flags are protected, and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disrupt them or destroy their breeding spots.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help in the work.
She says: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species, we simply don’t know how the populations are doing.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers will sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape allegations against himself as "false news" and says that people "love their fame" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of paying her $3755,000 in the aftermath of keeping close to the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
When he spoke on a direct video on Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after the charges were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo rejected the charges as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news, says five times winner of the Goldball into the camera.
"They want fame by using my name.
It's common.
They want fame by naming my name, but that’s part of the job.
“I’m a happy man and I’m good,” the football player adds with a smile.
Ronaldos lawyers prepare to sue Der Spiegel because of the allegations, which they have called "an unacceptable production of suspicions in the private sphere", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the footballer will demand compensation for “demnification damage to a scale equivalent to the severity of the infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of the privacy policy in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at a suite in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga have returned to the football player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents presented to the Clark County District Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell down on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99% a good person" who was failed by the "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that it was taken photos of her injuries in hospital, but later they took a look outside the court because she was "lived for revenge" and was also worried about being publicly suspended.
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to put the settlement aside because she is still traumatized after the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault, and moved this summer to Italian Juventus on a contract worth €100 million.
Brexit: Britain "will mourn forever" to lose car manufacturers
Britain "will mourn forever" if they lose the status of world leader in auto production after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "exhaustible" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without agreement, they would stop production temporarily at Burnaston's factory, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the consequences of delayed border crossing at any Brexit without a deal could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avenis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"If Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will experience that production at our factory halts," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO at Burnaston.
Other British producers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on how trade over borders will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, they will close the Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is whether the car manufacturers say supply chain risks at any Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is operated on the basis of "order as needed", and it will arrive at parts every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it may be staying at the border, which industry says can lead to delays and lack of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day inventory at Derbyshire factory, said the company, and thus production will stop.
Clark said Theresa May's Brexit plan for further ties with the EU is "presistated to avoid such controls at the border".
“We need to have an agreement. We want to get the best deal that makes us, as I say, not only can enjoy success at the moment, but that we take this opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The crew, not only from Toyota but also other car manufacturers, is that we must absolutely be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production will be halted, but warned that increasing costs in the long term will reduce factory competitiveness and eventually result in loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a union leader at the factory, said the members are increasingly concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs disappear, they will never return.”
A government spokesperson said: “We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again,” the White House said.
Donald Trump’s fateful meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein may be “excellent for a week” while the fight for Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh continues, White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein has oversight of special adviser Robert Mueller, who examines Russian involvement in the election, relations between Trump officials and Russia, as well as possible obstacles to judicial exercise by the President.
The question of Trump will dismiss the vice-justice minister or not, and thus threaten Mueller's independence, for many months has enjoyed during the speculation in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of recording talks with Trump and trying to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that he was voluntarily absent.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, which was at the time in the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he wanted to go out and kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid it collided with the Senates Judiciary Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI survey of one week on charges against Kavanaugh, which further exposed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
On questions about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “A date for the meeting was not established. It could be this week, but I realized it could be a week’s delay because of all that happens to the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I’m always busy keeping the press up to date.”
Some journalists will contest the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked about the cause.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to the reluctance of TV reporters "self-righteousness", although she added: "I do not disagree with the fact that they are self-good."
Then she suggested that contact between Trump and the press will be more frequent.
“The residence is making more questions than any former president,” she said, adding without giving evidence: “We’ve seen the numbers.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but "If the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States questions directly, it will certainly be better than talking to me.
We try to make it often, and you’ve seen that we’ve done it often over the past few weeks, and it’s going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open lectures or press conferences when visiting important people.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible cause, as he preferred a solo race and at times had a strange behavior in front of a crowd of reporters.
Health secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland on Brexit concerns
The Secretary-General has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS (state health care) to express the country’s gratitude and a desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish Member of Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain had to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the costs of application for residence and work permits for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “The negotiations between the UK and the EU on the release have been conducted through the summer and are expected to land on a solution to the fall.
But the British government has also stepped up the preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I understand that this must be a very difficult time for you all.
I will therefore repeat now how much I value the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Collectors from all over the EU, and outside, provide valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services to the best patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we hope you will be here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes urgent surgery after head injury
Defense player at Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, underwent urgent surgery after having suffered a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of the Tennessee newspaper.
Tennessee State's head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the first half was over.
"He came out on the sideline and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him behind for further investigation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had been operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is no information on the type/capture of the injury yet" and Tennessee State attempts to figure out when the injury is in danger.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is inside his first season with Tennessee State after transition from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before finishing the game, giving a total of 18 tackles for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. According to new Tory plans, the extra money will be used to help the homeless
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's plan to attract young voters
The document fee will be taxed from those who do not pay taxes in the UK
Experts in the Ministry of Finance expect it to increase up to 120 million pounds a year - to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the UK - and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be considered an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to attract young voters with promise to offer more affordable housing and frame high-income groups.
The document fee search will be imposed on people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money will strengthen government action to relieve the homeless situation.
The surplus - which comes in addition to the current document fee, including the higher ceiling introduced two years ago on housing number two and housing purchases for rent - can be as much as 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects that the measure will bring up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by people who do not live in the UK. This drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get foot within the housing market.
Many well-respected areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "sponsored cities" because of the many foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson made a proposal for a reduction in the document fee to help more young people own their own home.
He accused large construction firms of holding housing prices high by buying up land without using it, demanding Theresa May to reject quotas on reasonable housing to solve Britain's "smoky housing policy".
Jeremy Corbyn has announced an up-to-date series of proposed housing reforms, including rental controls and an end to unfounded drafts.
He also wants to give local governments greater power to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said that I would acquire my time as Prime Minister to restore the British dream — that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it may not be as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and also foreign-based companies, to buy housing as it is too hard working British citizens.
For very many people, the dream of owning their own home has become far too distant, and the unfavorable situation for the homeless goods.”
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager before or since.
The 42-year-old shot looks forward to the challenge of reviving the club in the northeast, which currently holds third in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
“I got a B-caps and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportssound.
"But I was often with my father and then Scotland at Hampden as a child, and there's always something that pulls me back.
This opportunity would only come if I succeed in the club management.”
Ross' predecessors such as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not anxious to follow such established names in the big club, and has previously declined the approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Successs for me at the moment will be measured if I can get the club back in the Premier League".
From the structure and facilities of this club, they belong to the undoubtedly Premier League,” he said.
It’s not a simple task to get it there, but I’ll probably just consider myself to have succeeded here if I get the club back there.”
Ross has only been in management for three years, after a period of assistant chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month short appearance in Hearts' coaching staff.
Then he helped Alloa retiring from down to third division and helped St Mirren from the brink of downturn to win the championship following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his acting career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was likely a proper trap,” he recalls when he took over the management of Alloa.
“I really thought leadership was right for me, more right than playing.
It sounds strange since I did well, created me a reasonable income of it and experienced some fine highlights.
But football betting can be tough.
There are many things you need to get through on a weekly basis.
I go through it in terms of stress and pressure at work, but management feels right for me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do it. It feels like the most comfortable I’ve known throughout my adult life.”
You can hear the entire interview on Sportssound on Sunday, September 30, at Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 1:00 BST.
Perfect time for a half-liter is 17.30 on Saturdays, shows survey
The summer heat wave has strengthened the revenue for the UK’s hard-pressed pubs, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Puber and bars experienced a sales increase of 2.7% in July, while the income for restaurants fell 4.8%, the figures show.
Peter Martin, a corporate consultant CGA, who summarized the figures, said: “Fortset sunshine and England’s unexpectedly long participation in the World Cup made July follow a similar pattern as the previous month of June, when the pubs went up 2.8%, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurant in June just worsened in July.
Drinking-based pubs and bars had the far best result, but an increase that was stronger like-for-like than what restaurants went down.
Puber with food serving also had difficulty with the sun, although it was not as dramatic as the racetaurant drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted to drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, sales increased by 6.6% that month, with food serving went down 3%.
Paul Newman, analyst from the hotel and restaurant industry RSM, stated: “These results follow the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and big sports and social events are still the main factors in terms of sales on the market.
There will not be any surprise that restaurant groups still have it difficult, and a turnover of 4.8% year-on-year will be particularly painful at the top of running cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food serving businesses, and the time will show if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide a long-awaited breathing space.”
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in rollouts of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, industry management for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, collects and analyzes the results of 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of 9 billion pounds, and is the established industry standard.
One in five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from parents
One in five children - some are only 11 years old - have secret accounts on social media that they hide from parents and teachers, show survey
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed pages with "fake Insta".
The news has raised concerns about sharing sexual content.
20% of students said they have a “head account” that they show their parents.
One of five children - some are only 11 years old - create accounts on social media that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid growth in "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to photo sharing pages on Instagram.
The news has raised the concerns that sexual content is shared.
20% of students said they had an innocent “head account” that they refer to their parents while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to "violent me".
The research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the principals’ conference (HMC) for private schools revealed that 40% of 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s scary that so many youths are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the athletes in Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics and has a non-executive role on the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete, and Chairman Ian Beattie described the incident as a good opportunity for those who lead the sport to gain insight into her extensive experience at international Nviå over the past ten years.
"Eididh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world-wide athletics environment, and we are sure that athletes in Scotland will enjoy the benefits of getting her into the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I have a lot to contribute to guiding sports in Scotland.”
The American won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and has a total of four Olympic gold. She is now a regular BBC expert, and after she got a transient ischemic attack, she failed to go.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago today I got a hit.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time will show if I want to be restored and to what degree.
It's been hard work, but I'm pretty good again and have learned to go again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
Breast pump ads comparing mothers with cow split opinion online
A breast pump company has split opinion online with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers with cows that get milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first soundless breast pump carrying close to the body,” Elvie, the technology-based company for consumer goods, a fresh and flirting, music video-inspired ad to show the freedom the new pump provides active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of high and cow to a song including the following text: “Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see any tail” and “In case you didn’t understand it, this isn’t jur, it’s my soups.”
The choir continues: “Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my balls.”
However, the ad published on the company’s Facebook page has created storms online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many say the fictional "gruities" in the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
As we must be pregnant and born to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth, it was one who wrote.
Elvie breast pump gets fine place in a breast-bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Repentible traumatic for both mother and baby.
“Why not use them to announce a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another added: “For a failed ad.”
Another defends the ad. A woman admitted that she thinks the song is "unbelievably funny".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would love to have one if I was still breast-feeding.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I took it for it was.
This is a brilliant product, it was one that wrote.
Another commented: “This is a fun ad aimed at mothers as pumps (often in the workplace or toilets) and feels like ‘cues’.
This is not an ad that celebrates or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have all danced with the disk pump in the bh-.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely quiet, has no wires or hoses and is provided fine space in a breast-bh so that women get the freedom to move, keep their baby and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and milk cubes, we wanted to put spotlights on breast pumping and all the challenges, while in a entertaining and recognizable way, the incredible freedom feel the new pump provides.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a two-child mom appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp at Texas border secretly
The number of detainees migrant children has gone on to be even though the monthly border crossing has remained relatively stable, partly because hard rhetoric and politics introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children in supporters.
Traditionally, most supporters themselves have been undocumented immigrants, and have been afraid to destroy their own chances of becoming in the country by three forwards and demanding a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults in the household had to enter fingerprints and that the data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of immigration and customs authorities, testified that Congress had arrested dozens of people who sought to be a supporter of single minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no previous criminal record.
“Next 80% of people who are either supporters or members of the household of supporters are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
The employees try to deal with the children faster and introduce new rules that indicate that some of them must meet in court within one month after being arrested, and not 60 days that were the previous standard, according to reception staff.
Many will be made via video conferencing instead of meeting up personally to lead their case of residence permit for an immigration judge.
Those who are considered eligible asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in custody, the greater the risk that they get anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to reception workers and reports that have emerged in their employ in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns have grown at a larger facility like Tornillo, where children who wear more easily are overlooked due to the size of the plant.
They pledge that moving children to the tent camp without having enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can reinforce trauma that many already struggle with.
Syria calls for U.S., French and Turkish "occupied forces" to withdraw immediately
In a speech in the UN General Assembly, Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, although the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces stayed illegally on Syrian soil under the supervision of combating terrorism and “will be treated accordingly.”
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror” in Syria, where more than 300,000 people have died since 2011 and millions are on the move.
He said Damascus will continue to "see this sacred struggle until we have cleared all Syrian territories" both for terrorist groups and "all foreign presence".
The United States has around 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and consulting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-held country.
When it comes to refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused "certain Western countries" to "pre-rational flight" that causes refugees to stay away.
“We have approached the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are serious about what is really a pure humanitarian situation.”
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no support for rebuilding Syria before a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the rebels’ last major defense position at Idlib has created an opportunity to push for political talks.
The Russian/Turkish agreement abolished a large scale attack of Russian-backed Syrian forces against the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including fighters from Al-Qaeda affiliated Nusra Front, as "will be wiped out".
U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes he will soon be able to call for the first meetings of a new committee consisting of state and opposition members to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem provided conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited to "through the articles of the present Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Period
After that logic, Trump would have won reelection in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope for, impeachment and scandal make an end to the presidency before that time.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic conclusion of a presidency ever!”
At the moment, there are no signs of sater justice.
Since 2014, the seasons for best time have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has peaked at the cable numbers with a total of 3.5 million viewers on evenings with major news items.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to because we don't understand anything," said Neal Baer, director of ABC drama "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a renowned comedy and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh".
It is an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the actions that play out in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, if immigrants families can reunite and health to the global economy.
Release is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you stretch far to be an enlightened person when you stay seated for six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep dive in background fabric" for the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's leather jacket with strutsefjær worth $15,000 (a garment mirrored with hybris," Washington Post) and following Trumpy's description ...
I don’t want to look at Super Mario in the same way anymore.
"Some of what he does makes it look like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, daily leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the "Pawn Stars", about Trump show's varying cast and daily twist on the plot (kangle with NFL, shameless Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss one episode, otherwise you'll be hanging out.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was 27 °C and sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he was living in and then on MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He could not tear loose, not when Brett Kavanaugh will meet the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court of the United States is at stake.
"I remember when we made all the crazy programs in old days and people said this is the end of Western civilization," Floiss said.
“I thought it was a sort of joke, but it turned out that they were right.”

Money from outside flows into the smoothest middle elections of the House of Representatives
There is no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district experiences a flow of money after a re-establishment of a congressional district that ended with two sitting representatives fighting for the same seat.
This newly renovated suburban district of Pittsburgh is running with the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a suspension election last year.
Lamb opposes another sitting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which greatly overlaps the new 17th district.
The map was redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old districts were a unconstitutional manipulation of the constituency in the republicans' favor.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive race on campaign funding between the largest party funding groups, the DCCC (Democrat Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb was a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a button victory in a closely followed pick-up election for Pennsylvania's 18th district to Congress in March last year.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a small leadership.
U.S. Protected Criminal Measures Against El Salvador for Support to China, then withdrew the threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a hearty meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama all the way to the partners threw out the leadership team of Trump Organization.
Officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call back the U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, the penalty measures were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug controls, development and financial support.
The proposed criminal measures, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials exposed a conference at the top level that focused on security and economic growth to follow up a similar collection last year that was considered a step forward in the attempt to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, officials in the top administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, which halted all plans for criminal action against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now framed to speak to the conference, which is now planned in mid-October, to show the importance of administration additionals the collection, the diplomat said.
And the three U.S. envoys returned calmly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new tough messages or penalty measures from Washington.
A spokesman at the White House for Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations under the assumption of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn from History
The next nail in the coffin may be specialist advisor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstruction of legal practice, which is now very solid evidence of public documents.
Mueller is allegedly also expanding the investigation into whether Trump’s campaign collaborated with Russia in the involvement of our elections.
If Congress were to change its side, Trump would be held accountable in that body, in the midst of preparations to meet voters again and perhaps finally a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertain factors, and I do not believe that Trump’s fall is inevitable — nor for his counterparts in Europe.
Elections must be made by us all on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, which will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were able to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West had stood up against him and supported the Czechoslovakians at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath that followed.
The history of history revolves around such wave points, and democracy’s relentless march is accelerated or inhibited.
The Americans face more of these spots now.
What will we do if Trump kicks deputy justice minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's review?
Rosenstein has been in hard weather ever since this paper reported that last year he proposed secret cancellations by the president and speculated that he was unfit to be president.
Rosenstein says The Times' production is incorrect.
"How will we react if the newly-owned FBI survey by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible abuse charges and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote under the election of a Congress that will put Trump in charge?
If we do not consist of the tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail because of the experience I received in Prague.
My mother was Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who once occupied my ambassador home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me away to light Sabbath lights on the table with the chin choir.
With such a legacy, how can I be optimistic about our future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorans optimistic before meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers are accepting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, in sure that victory over the Austrians after the impressive tie match in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorans from making his first appearance for the season in the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he thinks Rangers can use the result as a springboard to get bigger things.
"It was a good point for us since Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game and thought we could get something and get with us a point.
Maybe we could have reached the end, but the draw was probably a good result.
They were probably better in the first place, and we came out in the second half and were the best team.
On Thursday, there will be a big night in Europe.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in last game, but with home audiences in the back I am sure we can stand on and get a positive result.
The last year was absolutely tough, between everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but there is a good feeling now.
The team is good and the boys are happy; the training is good.
Hopefully we can stand up now, put the previous season behind us and get it done.”
Women lose night sleep because of the fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear formation on how they wanted to be taken care of, there were few who talked to the family about it.
Around half of the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to the kids about it.
“People want to be taken care of by someone in the family, but they do nothing to take that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to give you care if you don’t say what you want in advance.
Discuss with the counselor and the family where and how the care should be given. Such choices can be of great importance to determine the costs.
Bring your financial advisor: The advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for the expenses.
The funding options for long-term care may include a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid life insurancepolis with cash value to help cover these expenses or self-assurance with your own assets — if you have enough money.
Work out your legal documents: Avoid legal problems immediately.
Get a health care force in place by appointing a person you trust to have an overview of your medical care and assure you that your health care workers will comply with your wishes if you would be prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving any authority over your economy.
You choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you can’t do it yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your old parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write up the details in an overview so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just the economy that’s at stake, who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
What medicines do you need?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have that overview in place".

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a heavy earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and the death figures are expected to rise.
Communication is out of operation, and rescue workers have not been able to obtain information from Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake by magnitude 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regent that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in northwest part of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, an administrative region under provincial level, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the supporting beams of the central province of Sulawesis economy, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s emergency relief administration.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province north of Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226 000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with magnitude 6.8 hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populated island and triggered a tsunami that struck the south coast. More than 700 people were killed.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, off the Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 metres that raged dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A suspected earthquake hit the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic while humans were reminded of the ravages of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but over 100 were killed by coincidental buildings.
2018: Severe earthquake strikes Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok and kills more than 500 people, most on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested after charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice-president Sarah Palin, has been arrested after abuse charges.
Palin, 29 years old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested after suspicion of domestic domestic violence, clashing with a report on domestic violence and arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he had taken the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged assault.
Palin is detained in Mat-Su custody and is arrested for an uncertain debt letter worth $500, KTUU reported.
He was presented to the court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, absolutely" when asked how he posed the matter, the network reported.
Palin is confronted with three offenses of Class A, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and charged a fine of $250,000.
He has also been accused of a ruling by Class B, which can be punished with one day in prison and a fine of $22,000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been targeted.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report the alleged assault.
The case is taken in Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, cleavage with the report on domestic violence and for holding a weapon while drunk in connection with the incident.
His boyfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behaviour to PTSD after service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed many thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are down, and death figures are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just at central Sulawesi, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
It circulates videos on social media showing the outbreak.
Several hundred people were gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palu da tsunamien durded across the beach.
Federal prosecutors rarely seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York seek the death penalty for Sayyfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York who killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been exercised in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a rental car from Home Depot to perform an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he hit pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "predicted" and caused serious bodily damage with purpose, according to the warning of the intention of seeking the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for possible death penalty, according to the case document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury dropped 22 point figures, including eight charges of murder in connection with money extortion, on the face of Saipov, normally used by federal prosecutors in matters of organized crime, and a vision of violence and the wrecking of vehicles.
The attack called for "demnity planning and purpose," said prosecutors, who described the way Saipov performed it as "holy, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, property and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci", the warning stated.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York brought a case that could give the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York City in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to perform spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg pair was executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to the court documents.
He told investigators he was happy about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after seeing ISIS videos on the mobile, according to the survey.
He also asked to hang up the ISIS flag in the hospital, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the charges of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the publicly appointed defenders of Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" over the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a confession and life in prison without the possibility of release will only extend the trauma of these events to all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecution authorities not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the army of the people" today during a demonstration at the Tory Conference.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians would have "followed the pressure" from the Euro-Politics, when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he would be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that Britain "would have been outraded" now if Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge for May to reconcile its deeply divided ranks has been underlined by pro-Remain Tories who participated in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep the Brexit plan on track against attacks by Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she will continue to try to make an agreement with Brüssel despite the backlash - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "caos".
Bone told "Excellent" protesters in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He suggested Farage should have been made a member and was in charge of negotiations with Brüssel.
"If he had the responsibility, we would have been out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I want to stand for Brexit, but we must reject the Brexit plan.”
When he was going to explain his opposition to the EU, he said: “We didn’t fight in two world wars to become submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed claims that the referendum had changed since the 2016 vote: “The claim that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain in the EU is completely wrong.”
Tory Brexiter Andrea Jenkys also participated in the demonstration and told reporters: “I say simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Brexit plan is unpopular in the general public. The opposition will not vote for it. It is unpopular in the party and in our activists, who are actually those who traverse the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Discard the Brexit plan and start listening".
In a direct message to May, she added: “State ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage stated that politicians would be "following the pressure" if they thought of betraying the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
“This is now about the trust between us — the people — and the politicians,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to let them know they won’t get away with it.”
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to let our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
We mobilize the army of the people in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud UK.”
Imens marched Remainers through Birmingham before they had a two-hour political gathering in the center of the city.
A small amount of activists fanted with Tories Against Brexit banners after launch of the group this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis taunted the conservatives for the security issues they had with a party app as the conference began.
“This is the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete father.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren is seriously considering running as a pre-residence candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider seriously to run for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about the future during a City Hall meeting in the west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who served as vice chairman of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She has been central to the speculation if she is going to run against Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with electors, who have used the Town Hall format since Trump became president.
A participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it’s time for women to get to Washington to fix our defective government, and it includes a woman on top.”
Arrested after Sims of LSU was killed by shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the shooting incident that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Police in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, in a news conference at 11.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near campus at Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in his head and died as a result of that," police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the spot and had weapons with him. He admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without a shower and placed in custody at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Chamber.
Sims was a two-metre high youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 starting last season. His average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton targets the world championship title after stable orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes’ stable order would play a major role in the race.
From pole, Bottas got a good start and swept almost Hamilton off the track while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and allowed Hamilton to continue driving in the rear part of the main field, which should have been crucial.
Mercedes made a pit stop a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up after some squid with the wheels that made the Ferrari driver reluctantly let the inside be free after a double pass to defend themselves in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the rear row of the field and entered No. 7 at the end of his first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he led in large parts of the race while lying on the wheels to try to get a quick finish and overpower Kimi Raikkonen who lay no. four.
He finally entered the depot at 44th round, but failed to increase the pace of the remaining eight rounds and the Raikkonen took fourth place.
It’s a difficult day because Valtteri did a fabulous job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me go.
The team has done a fabulous job to get a good two-span," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Diane Feinstein during a police event on Saturday for her statement that she did not leave the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When the president spoke at an event in West Virginia, he did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and instead commented that what was going on in the Senate shows that people are “nonsinct, horrible, and speak untrue.”
“The only thing that could happen and the lovely thing that has been going on in the last few days of the Senate when you experience the mind when you see people who are angry and awful and speak untrue,” he said.
“When you look at extradition and leaks, they say, ‘Oh, I haven’t done it.
I haven't done it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you ever gone?
Do you remember her answer... did you see the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven’t smiled.”
Hey, wait a minute.
We were bored... no, we didn't laugh," he added, with an imitation of the senator's voice.
Feinstein was sent the letter with detailed information about the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak coming from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't leave her story," Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked.”
But her denial was not taken up by the president, who during the party event Saturday night commented: "I'll tell you a thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t do it, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his continued defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used the allegations for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take back power with all the necessary means.
You see the madness, evil, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to drive to gain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss against the Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants received a two-point lead via shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie made the home team debut before Dwyer restored the lead for Giants.
Francois Bouchard appointed for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League loss for the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come behind after they beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the third meeting of the season between the teams, and Giants had won the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaul, and David Rutherford posted the game when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan led the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt retired to Cownies equation at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that Giants had the lead at a break when he took his second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard probably once again with a mastery goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran went together to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the game late in the second half, and he secured the victory with the team's five-inch half way out into the final.
Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Flight leader dies to ensure that hundreds of flight passengers escape earthquakes
A flight manager in Indonesia is hailed as the hero after he died and assured that a plane that had hundreds of passengers safely taken off.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a heavy earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after the colleagues had fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the highly swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He remained in charge of Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway just then, safely could easily.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died later in hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved many hundred lives, Australia’s ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts were getting worse when we heard it,” he added.
The authorities fear that the death figures can come up in thousands, and the country’s disaster preparedness body reports that there is limited access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The numbers are expected to rise further since many bodies are still trapped under the ruins and many have not been possible to reach,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have razed Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “All the time you see ambulances that pick up the casualties.
There is a lack of clean water.
Mini markets are being robbed everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, stated to CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross jobs febrisk to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse.”
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to perform all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” CNN said.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports that a man is missing after plane crash in the lagoon
The airline that owned the aircraft that crashed in a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, says now that one man is missing. They reported earlier that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that it was one male passenger they did not have an overview of.
The airline said they collaborated with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request for more details on the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
The officials said on Friday that seven people had been transported to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and the condition of all was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said the aircraft landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane hit the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very low.
“It’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to do what through midjeddyt water to the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants had panicked and screamed, and that he had a minor head injury.
U.S. Navy said sailors who worked near to repair a brewer, also helped in rescue work using an inflatable boat to carry people in land before the plane sank about 30 meters below the water surface.
Data from Aviation Safety Network suggests that 111 people have died in crashes with PNG-registered aircraft over the past twenty years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analysts present the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors closed the procedure Saturday in a new trial for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Analyst in the Justice Department, Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described the jury how he used mobile prints to puddle the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he collected localization data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was together with Chambers that night she died, which strung against what he had claimed earlier, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same place as the mobile phone of Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness box on Saturday and claimed he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis spoke true when he claimed he was in Sanford's trailer that night, Sanford said he "solved because my trailer was in Nashville".
Another disagreement was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile journals suggest that they had only known each other for one week.
Rowlett said that a little after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted calls, contact details, and messages from Chambers from his phone.
“He deleted her from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be left the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is community-bed hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from the origins of political messages to address social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and create community-bed hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have experienced a new resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
Child passports in New York sue couples for dismissal after "racist" message
A child passport in New York sues a couple of discriminatory dismissals after receiving a misdirected message from her mother, who complained that she was "a black person".
The couple rejects that they are racist and compares the lawsuit with "expression".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a two-child mother, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new child passer, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up for the first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEII ENDA A SART PERSON", wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After discovering the tab, it was an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman who said up Maurice, claiming that their up-to-date child passport, which was African American, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for his one working day and was then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the resignation and demands compensation in the order of magnitude $350 per day for the six months long, the losji-based scheme she was promised, but without a contract.
“I wanted to show them that, “Hey, that’s how you just don’t do,” she told the New York Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have turned back against the charges that they are racial and say the resignation of Maurice was the only right thing since they didn't feel they could trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
“We are not racist,” said Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
“But would you have left your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn child?
Come on.
The comparison of the lawsuit with "expression" says Plasco was because his wife had only two months to term and was in a "very difficult situation".
Is that a person you want to punish?
It's not very nice," the stock broker added.
While the legal matter goes its way, the popular court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticize them for their behavior and attitudes.
The publisher of Paddington feared that readers would not accept a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was assumed, said of the letter: “It’s hard to sit in someone else’s place when they read it for the first time before it was released.
It’s really fun to know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
She says her father, who had worked as a cameraman in the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book of a small bear, would have been amazed that his work had been denied. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book release was "bitersweet" after he passed away last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important family member" and adds that her father was secretly very proud of the success he achieved.
"He was a rather quiet man, and he was not a bragger," she said.
“But since Paddington was so real for him, it was almost like when you have a child who makes a feat: you’re proud of it even though it’s not really your fault.
I think he considered Paddington's success a bit like that.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to give credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to the phone.
On landing, the daughter was rushed to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it looked so bad that he didn't think she would survive," Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got the phone from Nad who said she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I'm so happy with you, my friend.
I'll come to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
Medicine doctors had given her to get her heart beat, slowly lost her effect and left the system.
She died a while earlier and the organs of her body folded together.
I just had to sit there and wait, sure it happened.
I couldn’t hide and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to take myself together.”
In the end, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, went aboard the plane with the other passengers, who did not know about the trials she was undergoing.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I looked down all the time and tears ran into a steady stream.
It's hard to explain, but it was there on the plane I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcard with grieving women to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up postcards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers folded can call to get help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 when he was hit by depression and killed his life when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parents to experience what I have to relive every day,” she says.
45-year-old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says his son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him on the smile.
They said that his smile could light up any room.”
He quit his job before he died because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was one of those who found him after he killed his life.
Sharon says: “I worry all the time that it will be an infectious effect.”
Sharon made the cards “to tell people that there are people out there who they can go to talk to, even if it’s just a friend.
Not for yourself, you have to talk to someone.”
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost Mark, his partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t tell me he felt depressed or depressed,” she said.
“A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed the changing mood.
On Christmas Day, he was completely in the basement, when the kids opened the Christmas gifts, they did not achieve eye contact or anything.
She says his death was a great trauma to them, but they have to fight through it: "It rips up a big hole in the family.
It's gonna tear us apart.
We all have to stand out and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts investigation
“I thought that if we could get to some of what he asked for — a time- and scope-limited investigation — we might have come to a certain agreement,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee “simply apart” along fixed party limits.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The reluctance was due to timing.
The middle elections are only five weeks away, November 6, if the Republicans probably make it bad, it will be significantly more difficult for them to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has called around to senators and driven lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and hit her wife Ashley when she was a personal secretary for Bush.
What happens after the FBI filed its report?
It will be a vote in the Senate, where there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats at the moment.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, so Vice President Mike Pence can use his double vote and get him admitted to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors "falls" under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator stated.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from South Korea’s collection ministry, said there had been 1127 defectors last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park stated that stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices in human traffickers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
Most of North Korea’s defectors will be offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China sees the defections as illegal migrants and does not flee and returns them with power.
The relationship between North and South, which is technically still at war, has improved considerably over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that revolved around the locked negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the United States sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no possibility that we unilaterally will rust down first,” said Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric" and says he is unfit to sit in the Supreme Court
Minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric" and said he had a temperament that made him unfit to sit in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the statement in an interview on Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t think that if a woman had behaved like that, she would have been called hysterical,” said Pelosi on her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied feeling that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, sometimes almost yelled and was crying when he talked about his family and years in high school.
He was also strongly denounced by the Democrats of the committee and called the allegations against him a "grotec and coordinated character killing" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony shows that he can't sit in the Supreme Court since it shows he's opposed to Democrats.
"I mean he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to run Kavanaugh for impeachment if he was approved and if the Democrats received the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I want to say this — if he doesn’t tell the truth of Congress and the FBI, he’s not just unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he’s sitting in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals (an appeal court).
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was worried about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abort rights), since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the request, Kavanaugh avoided questions if he wanted to test certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time to send a hysterical, biased person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it,” Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
It’s a fair anger, months and years where the mind takes over and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s so weird, do you?”
She continues: “I got good help from a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said she also cried when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she spoke to, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just continued.
I thought I was amazing.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for harme in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs was in a man-dominated office. I started crying with unexplained rage and was caught in the neck by an older woman - a cool boss that I had always been a little scared of - who went with me to a stairway room.
“Let them never see you cry,” she said.
"They don't know you're furious.
They will believe you are tired and happy because they managed to take you.”
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a pre-residence candidate.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to be cheating on the spouse on board a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Schroeder was very frustrated and thought there was nothing in the way to investigate the possibilities of running for president himself.
“It wasn’t a thoughtful decision,” she said with a laughter 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last ones they needed were one more.
Some called it “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since it was closer to the end of the campaign, she left with the funding and swore that she would not run if she did not get $2 million.
It was a lost game.
She discovered that some of the supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“Do you think I’m getting a discount, or?” she wondered.
When she held the speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings - gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to drive money and to reach voters instead of delegates, as well as anger over sexism - that she fell in tears.
“You wanted me to have a nerve breakdown,” Schroeder recalls how the press talked to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking what they wanted to write on my grave support?
“She cried?”
How the US-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The opening halls of the trade war between the United States and China were ear-deep, and although the battle is far from over, a rift between countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by putting customs on important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion, meaning toll of half of all goods imported to the United States from China.
Beijing, of course, has retaliated every time, at the latest with a five to ten percent stake in American goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match the US attack on attacks, and the world’s second largest economy will probably not name the white flag with the first.
Getting Washington to step down means providing for claims, but public submission to the United States will be too humiliating to the Chinese President, Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure around the trade war with the United States can give positive prediction for China in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision, either in Washington or Beijing, could create conditions that start economic side effects in one of the countries, is actually much more dangerous than the spectators have set up earlier,” said Abigail Grace, a research fellow who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria "clear" for return of refugees, says Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says they are ready for voluntary return of refugees and appeals to help restore the country, which has been raging after more than 7 years of war.
When he spoke in the United Nations National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mooualem said that the conditions in the country are in demand.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress to combat terrorism," he said.
The state continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now aimed at voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that hit their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime will accept help to rebuild the ruined country.
But he stressed that it would not be accepted conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times after each other on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe re-elected the throne when the team of Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn received the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
United States star Phil Mickelson, who at the end of the big part of the tournament, made his tee teams in the water at par-3 16. holes, and had to see himself defeated by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant on all his rounds and became 1 of 4 golfers who have ever gone 5-0-0 since the tournament gained its current design in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5 and 4 by the lowest ranking player on the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most capped player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup final.
With eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind them, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most winning European in the history of 25.5 career points.
“I don’t tend to cry, but today I can’t be.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas picked me out and had faith in me.
I am very, very happy to get back the cup.
“It’s about the team, and I’m happy I could help,” said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He leaves the relay stick to his landman John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods - I followed that man close to the rise," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career points in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics for one of the biggest golfers ever, who have won 14 major titles, only defeated by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA all weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf with high precision throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk stated after a disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
It was the moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves.
Hat of Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and will look forward to the future.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their team captain.
You just have to take off your hat.
We were beaten.”
